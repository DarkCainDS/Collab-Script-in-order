His parents were very hard-working\\r\\nand deeply religious people, but so poor that they lived with their five\\r\\nchildren in only two rooms. The father and mother spent their evenings\\r\\nin reading aloud to their children, generally from books of a serious\\r\\ncharacter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in the\\r\\nfinal examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering. There he had\\r\\nalready begun his first work, “Poor Folk.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his review and\\r\\nwas received with acclamations. The shy, unknown youth found himself\\r\\ninstantly something of a celebrity. A brilliant and successful career\\r\\nseemed to open before him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he\\r\\nwas arrested.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist, Dostoevsky\\r\\nwas one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier\\r\\nand Proudhon. He was accused of “taking part in conversations against\\r\\nthe censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of\\r\\nknowing of the intention to set up a printing press.” Under Nicholas\\r\\nI. (that “stern and just man,” as Maurice Baring calls him) this was\\r\\nenough, and he was condemned to death. After eight months’ imprisonment\\r\\nhe was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to\\r\\nbe shot. Writing to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: “They snapped\\r\\nwords over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by\\r\\npersons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes,\\r\\nto suffer execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only\\r\\na few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones and\\r\\nI contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to\\r\\nbid them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound,\\r\\nbrought back upon the scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had spared\\r\\nus our lives.” The sentence was commuted to hard labour.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he was untied, and\\r\\nnever regained his sanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on\\r\\nDostoevsky’s mind. Though his religious temper led him in the end to\\r\\naccept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing\\r\\nin his own case, he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings.\\r\\nHe describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the\\r\\ncruelty of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal\\r\\nservitude, spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, where\\r\\nhe began the “Dead House,” and some years of service in a disciplinary\\r\\nbattalion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest\\r\\nand this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which he\\r\\nsuffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four times\\r\\na year and were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was\\r\\nallowed to return to Russia. He started a journal--“Vremya,” which was\\r\\nforbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. In 1864 he lost\\r\\nhis first wife and his brother Mihail. He was in terrible poverty, yet\\r\\nhe took upon himself the payment of his brother’s debts. He started\\r\\nanother journal--“The Epoch,” which within a few months was also\\r\\nprohibited. He was weighed down by debt, his brother’s family was\\r\\ndependent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and is\\r\\nsaid never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life were\\r\\nmuch softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the\\r\\nmonument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinary\\r\\ndemonstrations of love and honour.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to the grave by a\\r\\nvast multitude of mourners, who “gave the hapless man the funeral of a\\r\\nking.” He is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the feeling\\r\\ninspired by Dostoevsky: “He was one of ourselves, a man of our blood and\\r\\nour bone, but one who has suffered and has seen so much more deeply than\\r\\nwe have his insight impresses us as wisdom... that wisdom of the heart\\r\\nwhich we seek that we may learn from it how to live. All his other\\r\\ngifts came to him from nature, this he won for himself and through it he\\r\\nbecame great.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCRIME AND PUNISHMENT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART I\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\nOn an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of\\r\\nthe garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though\\r\\nin hesitation, towards K. bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His\\r\\ngarret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more\\r\\nlike a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,\\r\\ndinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time\\r\\nhe went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which\\r\\ninvariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a\\r\\nsick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was\\r\\nhopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but\\r\\nfor some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,\\r\\nverging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in\\r\\nhimself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not\\r\\nonly his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the\\r\\nanxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had\\r\\ngiven up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all\\r\\ndesire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror\\r\\nfor him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her\\r\\ntrivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats\\r\\nand complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to\\r\\nlie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and\\r\\nslip out unseen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely\\r\\naware of his fears.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these\\r\\ntrifles,” he thought, with an odd smile. “Hm... yes, all is in a man’s\\r\\nhands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that’s an axiom. It would\\r\\nbe interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new\\r\\nstep, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking\\r\\ntoo much. It’s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is\\r\\nthat I chatter because I do nothing. I’ve learned to chatter this\\r\\nlast month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the\\r\\nGiant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is\\r\\n_that_ serious? It is not serious at all. It’s simply a fantasy to amuse\\r\\nmyself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle\\r\\nand the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that\\r\\nspecial Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out\\r\\nof town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man’s already\\r\\noverwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which\\r\\nare particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men\\r\\nwhom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed\\r\\nthe revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest\\r\\ndisgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined face. He was,\\r\\nby the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,\\r\\nwell-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank\\r\\ninto deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness\\r\\nof mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring\\r\\nto observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the\\r\\nhabit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these\\r\\nmoments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a\\r\\ntangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted\\r\\nfood.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would\\r\\nhave been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter\\r\\nof the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have\\r\\ncreated surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number\\r\\nof establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading\\r\\nand working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the\\r\\nheart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets\\r\\nthat no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was\\r\\nsuch accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, that,\\r\\nin spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least\\r\\nof all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with\\r\\nacquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked\\r\\nmeeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown\\r\\nreason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy\\r\\ndray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: “Hey there, German\\r\\nhatter” bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young\\r\\nman stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall\\r\\nround hat from Zimmerman’s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all\\r\\ntorn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly\\r\\nfashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror\\r\\nhad overtaken him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I knew it,” he muttered in confusion, “I thought so! That’s the worst\\r\\nof all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might\\r\\nspoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd\\r\\nand that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any\\r\\nsort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such\\r\\na hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... What\\r\\nmatters is that people would remember it, and that would give them\\r\\na clue. For this business one should be as little conspicuous as\\r\\npossible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, it’s just such\\r\\ntrifles that always ruin everything....”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate\\r\\nof his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had counted\\r\\nthem once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no\\r\\nfaith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous\\r\\nbut daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon\\r\\nthem differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at\\r\\nhis own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard\\r\\nthis “hideous” dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he\\r\\nstill did not realise this himself. He was positively going now for a\\r\\n“rehearsal” of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more\\r\\nand more violent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house\\r\\nwhich on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the\\r\\nstreet. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by\\r\\nworking people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of\\r\\nsorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.\\r\\nThere was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the\\r\\ntwo courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed on\\r\\nthe building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and\\r\\nat once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the\\r\\nstaircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar\\r\\nwith it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings:\\r\\nin such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that\\r\\nI were really going to do it?” he could not help asking himself as he\\r\\nreached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some porters\\r\\nwho were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the\\r\\nflat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his\\r\\nfamily. This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this\\r\\nstaircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. “That’s a good\\r\\nthing anyway,” he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old\\r\\nwoman’s flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of\\r\\ntin and not of copper. The little flats in such houses always have bells\\r\\nthat ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now\\r\\nits peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it\\r\\nclearly before him.... He started, his nerves were terribly overstrained\\r\\nby now. In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old\\r\\nwoman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and\\r\\nnothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.\\r\\nBut, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and\\r\\nopened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, which\\r\\nwas partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood facing\\r\\nhim in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive,\\r\\nwithered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp\\r\\nlittle nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared\\r\\nwith oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck,\\r\\nwhich looked like a hen’s leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,\\r\\nand, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy\\r\\nfur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every\\r\\ninstant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar\\r\\nexpression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,” the young man made\\r\\nhaste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be more\\r\\npolite.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here,” the\\r\\nold woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And here... I am again on the same errand,” Raskolnikov continued, a\\r\\nlittle disconcerted and surprised at the old woman’s mistrust. “Perhaps\\r\\nshe is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other\\r\\ntime,” he thought with an uneasy feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side,\\r\\nand pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass\\r\\nin front of her:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Step in, my good sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on\\r\\nthe walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly\\r\\nlighted up at that moment by the setting sun.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So the sun will shine like this _then_ too!” flashed as it were by\\r\\nchance through Raskolnikov’s mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned\\r\\neverything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and\\r\\nremember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The\\r\\nfurniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with\\r\\na huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a\\r\\ndressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows,\\r\\nchairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow\\r\\nframes, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was\\r\\nall. In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everything\\r\\nwas very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished;\\r\\neverything shone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lizaveta’s work,” thought the young man. There was not a speck of dust\\r\\nto be seen in the whole flat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such\\r\\ncleanliness,” Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance\\r\\nat the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in\\r\\nwhich stood the old woman’s bed and chest of drawers and into which he\\r\\nhad never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you want?” the old woman said severely, coming into the room\\r\\nand, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in\\r\\nthe face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve brought something to pawn here,” and he drew out of his pocket\\r\\nan old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a\\r\\nglobe; the chain was of steel.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up the day\\r\\nbefore yesterday.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But that’s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell\\r\\nyour pledge at once.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You come with such trifles, my good sir, it’s scarcely worth anything.\\r\\nI gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it\\r\\nquite new at a jeweler’s for a rouble and a half.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father’s. I\\r\\nshall be getting some money soon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A rouble and a half!” cried the young man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Please yourself”--and the old woman handed him back the watch. The\\r\\nyoung man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going\\r\\naway; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere\\r\\nelse he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hand it over,” he said roughly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behind\\r\\nthe curtain into the other room. The young man, left standing alone in\\r\\nthe middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking. He could hear\\r\\nher unlocking the chest of drawers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It must be the top drawer,” he reflected. “So she carries the keys in\\r\\na pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel ring.... And there’s\\r\\none key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches;\\r\\nthat can’t be the key of the chest of drawers... then there must be some\\r\\nother chest or strong-box... that’s worth knowing. Strong-boxes always\\r\\nhave keys like that... but how degrading it all is.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman came back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so I must take\\r\\nfifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. But\\r\\nfor the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me now twenty copecks\\r\\non the same reckoning in advance. That makes thirty-five copecks\\r\\naltogether. So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the\\r\\nwatch. Here it is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just so.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man did not dispute it and took the money. He looked at the\\r\\nold woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was still\\r\\nsomething he wanted to say or to do, but he did not himself quite know\\r\\nwhat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I may be bringing you something else in a day or two, Alyona\\r\\nIvanovna--a valuable thing--silver--a cigarette-box, as soon as I get it\\r\\nback from a friend...” he broke off in confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, we will talk about it then, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-bye--are you always at home alone, your sister is not here with\\r\\nyou?” He asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the\\r\\npassage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What business is she of yours, my good sir?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked. You are too quick.... Good-day,\\r\\nAlyona Ivanovna.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This confusion became more\\r\\nand more intense. As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, two\\r\\nor three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought. When he was\\r\\nin the street he cried out, “Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! and\\r\\ncan I, can I possibly.... No, it’s nonsense, it’s rubbish!” he added\\r\\nresolutely. “And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head?\\r\\nWhat filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all,\\r\\ndisgusting, loathsome, loathsome!--and for a whole month I’ve been....”\\r\\n But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The feeling\\r\\nof intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart\\r\\nwhile he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a\\r\\npitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to\\r\\ndo with himself to escape from his wretchedness. He walked along the\\r\\npavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostling\\r\\nagainst them, and only came to his senses when he was in the next\\r\\nstreet. Looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern\\r\\nwhich was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement.\\r\\nAt that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing and\\r\\nsupporting one another, they mounted the steps. Without stopping to\\r\\nthink, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once. Till that moment he had\\r\\nnever been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a\\r\\nburning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his\\r\\nsudden weakness to the want of food. He sat down at a sticky little\\r\\ntable in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank\\r\\noff the first glassful. At once he felt easier; and his thoughts became\\r\\nclear.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All that’s nonsense,” he said hopefully, “and there is nothing in it\\r\\nall to worry about! It’s simply physical derangement. Just a glass of\\r\\nbeer, a piece of dry bread--and in one moment the brain is stronger,\\r\\nthe mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all\\r\\nis!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now looking cheerful\\r\\nas though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazed\\r\\nround in a friendly way at the people in the room. But even at that\\r\\nmoment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also\\r\\nnot normal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides the two drunken\\r\\nmen he had met on the steps, a group consisting of about five men and\\r\\na girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time. Their departure\\r\\nleft the room quiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavern\\r\\nwere a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not extremely so,\\r\\nsitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man with\\r\\na grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat. He was very drunk: and had\\r\\ndropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he began as though in\\r\\nhis sleep, cracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the upper\\r\\npart of his body bounding about on the bench, while he hummed some\\r\\nmeaningless refrain, trying to recall some such lines as these:\\r\\n\\r\\n   “His wife a year he fondly loved\\r\\n    His wife a--a year he--fondly loved.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOr suddenly waking up again:\\r\\n\\r\\n   “Walking along the crowded row\\r\\n    He met the one he used to know.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no one shared his enjoyment: his silent companion looked with\\r\\npositive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations. There was\\r\\nanother man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government\\r\\nclerk. He was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and\\r\\nlooking round at the company. He, too, appeared to be in some agitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided\\r\\nsociety of every sort, more especially of late. But now all at once he\\r\\nfelt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be taking\\r\\nplace within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He\\r\\nwas so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy\\r\\nexcitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other\\r\\nworld, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of the\\r\\nsurroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently\\r\\ncame down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots with\\r\\nred turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his\\r\\nperson. He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat,\\r\\nwith no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an\\r\\niron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was\\r\\nanother boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted. On the\\r\\ncounter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and\\r\\nsome fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferably\\r\\nclose, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such\\r\\nan atmosphere might well make a man drunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the\\r\\nfirst moment, before a word is spoken. Such was the impression made on\\r\\nRaskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him, who looked\\r\\nlike a retired clerk. The young man often recalled this impression\\r\\nafterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked repeatedly\\r\\nat the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staring\\r\\npersistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation. At\\r\\nthe other persons in the room, including the tavern-keeper, the clerk\\r\\nlooked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showing\\r\\na shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and\\r\\nculture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him to\\r\\nconverse. He was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height,\\r\\nand stoutly built. His face, bloated from continual drinking, was of\\r\\na yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen\\r\\nreddish eyes gleamed like little chinks. But there was something very\\r\\nstrange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense\\r\\nfeeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at the\\r\\nsame time there was a gleam of something like madness. He was wearing an\\r\\nold and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing\\r\\nexcept one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this\\r\\nlast trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered with spots\\r\\nand stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. Like a clerk, he wore\\r\\nno beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chin\\r\\nlooked like a stiff greyish brush. And there was something respectable\\r\\nand like an official about his manner too. But he was restless; he\\r\\nruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his\\r\\nhands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky\\r\\ntable. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, and said loudly and\\r\\nresolutely:\\r\\n\\r\\n“May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite conversation?\\r\\nForasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my\\r\\nexperience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not\\r\\naccustomed to drinking. I have always respected education when in\\r\\nconjunction with genuine sentiments, and I am besides a titular\\r\\ncounsellor in rank. Marmeladov--such is my name; titular counsellor. I\\r\\nmake bold to inquire--have you been in the service?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I am studying,” answered the young man, somewhat surprised at\\r\\nthe grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly\\r\\naddressed. In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for\\r\\ncompany of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his\\r\\nhabitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached\\r\\nor attempted to approach him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A student then, or formerly a student,” cried the clerk. “Just what\\r\\nI thought! I’m a man of experience, immense experience, sir,” and he\\r\\ntapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval. “You’ve been a\\r\\nstudent or have attended some learned institution!... But allow me....”\\r\\n He got up, staggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down beside\\r\\nthe young man, facing him a little sideways. He was drunk, but spoke\\r\\nfluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of his\\r\\nsentences and drawling his words. He pounced upon Raskolnikov as\\r\\ngreedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Honoured sir,” he began almost with solemnity, “poverty is not a vice,\\r\\nthat’s a true saying. Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue,\\r\\nand that that’s even truer. But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a\\r\\nvice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but\\r\\nin beggary--never--no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of human\\r\\nsociety with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as\\r\\nhumiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary\\r\\nI am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. Hence the pot-house!\\r\\nHonoured sir, a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and\\r\\nmy wife is a very different matter from me! Do you understand? Allow me\\r\\nto ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent\\r\\na night on a hay barge, on the Neva?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I have not happened to,” answered Raskolnikov. “What do you mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I’ve just come from one and it’s the fifth night I’ve slept\\r\\nso....” He filled his glass, emptied it and paused. Bits of hay were in\\r\\nfact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair. It seemed quite\\r\\nprobable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days.\\r\\nHis hands, particularly, were filthy. They were fat and red, with black\\r\\nnails.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest. The\\r\\nboys at the counter fell to sniggering. The innkeeper came down from the\\r\\nupper room, apparently on purpose to listen to the “funny fellow”\\r\\n and sat down at a little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity.\\r\\nEvidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most\\r\\nlikely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of\\r\\nfrequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in\\r\\nthe tavern. This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, and\\r\\nespecially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order\\r\\nat home. Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify\\r\\nthemselves and even if possible obtain consideration.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Funny fellow!” pronounced the innkeeper. “And why don’t you work, why\\r\\naren’t you at your duty, if you are in the service?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir,” Marmeladov went on, addressing\\r\\nhimself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as though it had been he who put\\r\\nthat question to him. “Why am I not at my duty? Does not my heart ache\\r\\nto think what a useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov\\r\\nbeat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn’t I suffer?\\r\\nExcuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you... hm... well, to\\r\\npetition hopelessly for a loan?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that you\\r\\nwill get nothing by it. You know, for instance, beforehand with positive\\r\\ncertainty that this man, this most reputable and exemplary citizen, will\\r\\non no consideration give you money; and indeed I ask you why should he?\\r\\nFor he knows of course that I shan’t pay it back. From compassion? But\\r\\nMr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day\\r\\nthat compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that that’s\\r\\nwhat is done now in England, where there is political economy. Why, I\\r\\nask you, should he give it to me? And yet though I know beforehand that\\r\\nhe won’t, I set off to him and...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why do you go?” put in Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! For every man must\\r\\nhave somewhere to go. Since there are times when one absolutely must\\r\\ngo somewhere! When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket,\\r\\nthen I had to go... (for my daughter has a yellow passport),” he added\\r\\nin parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man.\\r\\n“No matter, sir, no matter!” he went on hurriedly and with apparent\\r\\ncomposure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the\\r\\ninnkeeper smiled--“No matter, I am not confounded by the wagging of\\r\\ntheir heads; for everyone knows everything about it already, and all\\r\\nthat is secret is made open. And I accept it all, not with contempt, but\\r\\nwith humility. So be it! So be it! ‘Behold the man!’ Excuse me, young\\r\\nman, can you.... No, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not\\r\\n_can_ you but _dare_ you, looking upon me, assert that I am not a pig?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man did not answer a word.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity,\\r\\nafter waiting for the laughter in the room to subside. “Well, so be\\r\\nit, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I have the semblance of a beast, but\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officer’s\\r\\ndaughter. Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of a\\r\\nnoble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And yet... oh,\\r\\nif only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every man\\r\\nought to have at least one place where people feel for him! But Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust.... And yet, although\\r\\nI realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity--for\\r\\nI repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man,” he\\r\\ndeclared with redoubled dignity, hearing the sniggering again--“but, my\\r\\nGod, if she would but once.... But no, no! It’s all in vain and it’s no\\r\\nuse talking! No use talking! For more than once, my wish did come true\\r\\nand more than once she has felt for me but... such is my fate and I am a\\r\\nbeast by nature!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rather!” assented the innkeeper yawning. Marmeladov struck his fist\\r\\nresolutely on the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Such is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her very\\r\\nstockings for drink? Not her shoes--that would be more or less in the\\r\\norder of things, but her stockings, her stockings I have sold for drink!\\r\\nHer mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own\\r\\nproperty, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this\\r\\nwinter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. We have three\\r\\nlittle children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till\\r\\nnight; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for she’s\\r\\nbeen used to cleanliness from a child. But her chest is weak and she has\\r\\na tendency to consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I don’t feel it?\\r\\nAnd the more I drink the more I feel it. That’s why I drink too. I try\\r\\nto find sympathy and feeling in drink.... I drink so that I may suffer\\r\\ntwice as much!” And as though in despair he laid his head down on the\\r\\ntable.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Young man,” he went on, raising his head again, “in your face I seem to\\r\\nread some trouble of mind. When you came in I read it, and that was why\\r\\nI addressed you at once. For in unfolding to you the story of my life, I\\r\\ndo not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners,\\r\\nwho indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a man\\r\\nof feeling and education. Know then that my wife was educated in a\\r\\nhigh-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving she\\r\\ndanced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for\\r\\nwhich she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit.\\r\\nThe medal... well, the medal of course was sold--long ago, hm... but the\\r\\ncertificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed\\r\\nit to our landlady. And although she is most continually on bad terms\\r\\nwith the landlady, yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past\\r\\nhonours and of the happy days that are gone. I don’t condemn her for\\r\\nit, I don’t blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of\\r\\nthe past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a lady\\r\\nof spirit, proud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has\\r\\nnothing but black bread to eat, but won’t allow herself to be treated\\r\\nwith disrespect. That’s why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikov’s\\r\\nrudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to\\r\\nher bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. She was\\r\\na widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than the\\r\\nother. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and\\r\\nran away with him from her father’s house. She was exceedingly fond of\\r\\nher husband; but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that he\\r\\ndied. He used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back, of\\r\\nwhich I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of\\r\\nhim with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, I am glad\\r\\nthat, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as having\\r\\nonce been happy.... And she was left at his death with three children in\\r\\na wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and she\\r\\nwas left in such hopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups\\r\\nand downs of all sort, I don’t feel equal to describing it even. Her\\r\\nrelations had all thrown her off. And she was proud, too, excessively\\r\\nproud.... And then, honoured sir, and then, I, being at the time a\\r\\nwidower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offered\\r\\nher my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering. You can\\r\\njudge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of education\\r\\nand culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be my\\r\\nwife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, she\\r\\nmarried me! For she had nowhere to turn! Do you understand, sir, do you\\r\\nunderstand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No,\\r\\nthat you don’t understand yet.... And for a whole year, I performed\\r\\nmy duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch this” (he\\r\\ntapped the jug with his finger), “for I have feelings. But even so, I\\r\\ncould not please her; and then I lost my place too, and that through no\\r\\nfault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touch\\r\\nit!... It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at\\r\\nlast after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent\\r\\ncapital, adorned with innumerable monuments. Here I obtained a\\r\\nsituation.... I obtained it and I lost it again. Do you understand? This\\r\\ntime it was through my own fault I lost it: for my weakness had come\\r\\nout.... We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel’s;\\r\\nand what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say.\\r\\nThere are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. Dirt and\\r\\ndisorder, a perfect Bedlam... hm... yes... And meanwhile my daughter by\\r\\nmy first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up with\\r\\nfrom her step-mother whilst she was growing up, I won’t speak of. For,\\r\\nthough Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spirited\\r\\nlady, irritable and short-tempered.... Yes. But it’s no use going over\\r\\nthat! Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education. I did make an\\r\\neffort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal\\r\\nhistory, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and we\\r\\nhad no suitable books, and what books we had... hm, anyway we have not\\r\\neven those now, so all our instruction came to an end. We stopped at\\r\\nCyrus of Persia. Since she has attained years of maturity, she has read\\r\\nother books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great\\r\\ninterest a book she got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewes’ Physiology--do\\r\\nyou know it?--and even recounted extracts from it to us: and that’s the\\r\\nwhole of her education. And now may I venture to address you, honoured\\r\\nsir, on my own account with a private question. Do you suppose that\\r\\na respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteen\\r\\nfarthings a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special\\r\\ntalent and that without putting her work down for an instant! And what’s\\r\\nmore, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor--have you heard of\\r\\nhim?--has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirts she\\r\\nmade him and drove her roughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the\\r\\npretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were\\r\\nput in askew. And there are the little ones hungry.... And Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushed\\r\\nred, as they always are in that disease: ‘Here you live with us,’ says\\r\\nshe, ‘you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.’\\r\\nAnd much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the\\r\\nlittle ones for three days! I was lying at the time... well, what of\\r\\nit! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a gentle\\r\\ncreature with a soft little voice... fair hair and such a pale, thin\\r\\nlittle face). She said: ‘Katerina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thing\\r\\nlike that?’ And Darya Frantsovna, a woman of evil character and very\\r\\nwell known to the police, had two or three times tried to get at her\\r\\nthrough the landlady. ‘And why not?’ said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer,\\r\\n‘you are something mighty precious to be so careful of!’ But don’t blame\\r\\nher, don’t blame her, honoured sir, don’t blame her! She was not herself\\r\\nwhen she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying\\r\\nof the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anything\\r\\nelse.... For that’s Katerina Ivanovna’s character, and when children\\r\\ncry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once. At six o’clock\\r\\nI saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief and her cape, and go out of the\\r\\nroom and about nine o’clock she came back. She walked straight up to\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her\\r\\nin silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she\\r\\nsimply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl (we have a shawl,\\r\\nmade of _drap de dames_), put it over her head and face and lay down\\r\\non the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her\\r\\nbody kept shuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as before....\\r\\nAnd then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence\\r\\ngo up to Sonia’s little bed; she was on her knees all the evening\\r\\nkissing Sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell\\r\\nasleep in each other’s arms... together, together... yes... and I... lay\\r\\ndrunk.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMarmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him. Then he\\r\\nhurriedly filled his glass, drank, and cleared his throat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Since then, sir,” he went on after a brief pause--“Since then, owing\\r\\nto an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by\\r\\nevil-intentioned persons--in all which Darya Frantsovna took a\\r\\nleading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of\\r\\nrespect--since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take\\r\\na yellow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living with\\r\\nus. For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (though\\r\\nshe had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too...\\r\\nhm.... All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia’s\\r\\naccount. At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all of\\r\\na sudden he stood on his dignity: ‘how,’ said he, ‘can a highly educated\\r\\nman like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?’ And Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her... and so that’s\\r\\nhow it happened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she\\r\\ncomforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can.... She has a room\\r\\nat the Kapernaumovs’ the tailors, she lodges with them; Kapernaumov is\\r\\na lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft\\r\\npalates too. And his wife, too, has a cleft palate. They all live in one\\r\\nroom, but Sonia has her own, partitioned off.... Hm... yes... very poor\\r\\npeople and all with cleft palates... yes. Then I got up in the morning,\\r\\nand put on my rags, lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his\\r\\nexcellency Ivan Afanasyvitch. His excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do you\\r\\nknow him? No? Well, then, it’s a man of God you don’t know. He is wax...\\r\\nwax before the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth!... His eyes were\\r\\ndim when he heard my story. ‘Marmeladov, once already you have\\r\\ndeceived my expectations... I’ll take you once more on my own\\r\\nresponsibility’--that’s what he said, ‘remember,’ he said, ‘and now you\\r\\ncan go.’ I kissed the dust at his feet--in thought only, for in reality\\r\\nhe would not have allowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man of\\r\\nmodern political and enlightened ideas. I returned home, and when I\\r\\nannounced that I’d been taken back into the service and should receive a\\r\\nsalary, heavens, what a to-do there was!...”\\r\\n\\r\\nMarmeladov stopped again in violent excitement. At that moment a whole\\r\\nparty of revellers already drunk came in from the street, and the sounds\\r\\nof a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven\\r\\nsinging “The Hamlet” were heard in the entry. The room was filled with\\r\\nnoise. The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the new-comers.\\r\\nMarmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story.\\r\\nHe appeared by now to be extremely weak, but as he became more and more\\r\\ndrunk, he became more and more talkative. The recollection of his\\r\\nrecent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, and was\\r\\npositively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face. Raskolnikov\\r\\nlistened attentively.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was five weeks ago, sir. Yes.... As soon as Katerina Ivanovna\\r\\nand Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into the\\r\\nkingdom of Heaven. It used to be: you can lie like a beast, nothing but\\r\\nabuse. Now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. ‘Semyon\\r\\nZaharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, shh!’\\r\\nThey made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me! They\\r\\nbegan to get real cream for me, do you hear that? And how they managed\\r\\nto get together the money for a decent outfit--eleven roubles, fifty\\r\\ncopecks, I can’t guess. Boots, cotton shirt-fronts--most magnificent,\\r\\na uniform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and\\r\\na half. The first morning I came back from the office I found Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna had cooked two courses for dinner--soup and salt meat with\\r\\nhorse radish--which we had never dreamed of till then. She had not any\\r\\ndresses... none at all, but she got herself up as though she were going\\r\\non a visit; and not that she’d anything to do it with, she smartened\\r\\nherself up with nothing at all, she’d done her hair nicely, put on a\\r\\nclean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a different\\r\\nperson, she was younger and better looking. Sonia, my little darling,\\r\\nhad only helped with money ‘for the time,’ she said, ‘it won’t do for me\\r\\nto come and see you too often. After dark maybe when no one can see.’ Do\\r\\nyou hear, do you hear? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you\\r\\nthink: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with\\r\\nour landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could not\\r\\nresist then asking her in to coffee. For two hours they were sitting,\\r\\nwhispering together. ‘Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again,\\r\\nnow, and receiving a salary,’ says she, ‘and he went himself to his\\r\\nexcellency and his excellency himself came out to him, made all the\\r\\nothers wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into\\r\\nhis study.’ Do you hear, do you hear? ‘To be sure,’ says he, ‘Semyon\\r\\nZaharovitch, remembering your past services,’ says he, ‘and in spite\\r\\nof your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now and\\r\\nsince moreover we’ve got on badly without you,’ (do you hear, do you\\r\\nhear;) ‘and so,’ says he, ‘I rely now on your word as a gentleman.’ And\\r\\nall that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, and not\\r\\nsimply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; no, she believes it\\r\\nall herself, she amuses herself with her own fancies, upon my word she\\r\\ndoes! And I don’t blame her for it, no, I don’t blame her!... Six days\\r\\nago when I brought her my first earnings in full--twenty-three roubles\\r\\nforty copecks altogether--she called me her poppet: ‘poppet,’ said she,\\r\\n‘my little poppet.’ And when we were by ourselves, you understand?\\r\\nYou would not think me a beauty, you would not think much of me as a\\r\\nhusband, would you?... Well, she pinched my cheek, ‘my little poppet,’\\r\\nsaid she.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMarmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his chin began\\r\\nto twitch. He controlled himself however. The tavern, the degraded\\r\\nappearance of the man, the five nights in the hay barge, and the pot of\\r\\nspirits, and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered\\r\\nhis listener. Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation.\\r\\nHe felt vexed that he had come here.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Honoured sir, honoured sir,” cried Marmeladov recovering himself--“Oh,\\r\\nsir, perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you, as it does to\\r\\nothers, and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the\\r\\ntrivial details of my home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me.\\r\\nFor I can feel it all.... And the whole of that heavenly day of my life\\r\\nand the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams of how I would\\r\\narrange it all, and how I would dress all the children, and how I should\\r\\ngive her rest, and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonour\\r\\nand restore her to the bosom of her family.... And a great deal more....\\r\\nQuite excusable, sir. Well, then, sir” (Marmeladov suddenly gave a sort\\r\\nof start, raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) “well, on\\r\\nthe very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly five\\r\\ndays ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night,\\r\\nI stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box, took out what was\\r\\nleft of my earnings, how much it was I have forgotten, and now look\\r\\nat me, all of you! It’s the fifth day since I left home, and they are\\r\\nlooking for me there and it’s the end of my employment, and my uniform\\r\\nis lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge. I exchanged it for the\\r\\ngarments I have on... and it’s the end of everything!”\\r\\n\\r\\nMarmeladov struck his forehead with his fist, clenched his teeth, closed\\r\\nhis eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table. But a minute\\r\\nlater his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and\\r\\naffectation of bravado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a pick-me-up!\\r\\nHe-he-he!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t say she gave it to you?” cried one of the new-comers; he\\r\\nshouted the words and went off into a guffaw.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This very quart was bought with her money,” Marmeladov declared,\\r\\naddressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. “Thirty copecks she gave\\r\\nme with her own hands, her last, all she had, as I saw.... She said\\r\\nnothing, she only looked at me without a word.... Not on earth, but up\\r\\nyonder... they grieve over men, they weep, but they don’t blame them,\\r\\nthey don’t blame them! But it hurts more, it hurts more when they don’t\\r\\nblame! Thirty copecks yes! And maybe she needs them now, eh? What do\\r\\nyou think, my dear sir? For now she’s got to keep up her appearance. It\\r\\ncosts money, that smartness, that special smartness, you know? Do you\\r\\nunderstand? And there’s pomatum, too, you see, she must have things;\\r\\npetticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off her\\r\\nfoot when she has to step over a puddle. Do you understand, sir, do you\\r\\nunderstand what all that smartness means? And here I, her own father,\\r\\nhere I took thirty copecks of that money for a drink! And I am drinking\\r\\nit! And I have already drunk it! Come, who will have pity on a man like\\r\\nme, eh? Are you sorry for me, sir, or not? Tell me, sir, are you sorry\\r\\nor not? He-he-he!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left. The pot was\\r\\nempty.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you to be pitied for?” shouted the tavern-keeper who was again\\r\\nnear them.\\r\\n\\r\\nShouts of laughter and even oaths followed. The laughter and the oaths\\r\\ncame from those who were listening and also from those who had heard\\r\\nnothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged\\r\\ngovernment clerk.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To be pitied! Why am I to be pitied?” Marmeladov suddenly declaimed,\\r\\nstanding up with his arm outstretched, as though he had been only\\r\\nwaiting for that question.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why am I to be pitied, you say? Yes! there’s nothing to pity me for! I\\r\\nought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pitied! Crucify me,\\r\\noh judge, crucify me but pity me! And then I will go of myself to be\\r\\ncrucified, for it’s not merry-making I seek but tears and tribulation!...\\r\\nDo you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been\\r\\nsweet to me? It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and\\r\\ntribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pity\\r\\nus Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all\\r\\nthings, He is the One, He too is the judge. He will come in that day\\r\\nand He will ask: ‘Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross,\\r\\nconsumptive step-mother and for the little children of another? Where is\\r\\nthe daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earthly father,\\r\\nundismayed by his beastliness?’ And He will say, ‘Come to me! I have\\r\\nalready forgiven thee once.... I have forgiven thee once.... Thy sins\\r\\nwhich are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much....’ And he\\r\\nwill forgive my Sonia, He will forgive, I know it... I felt it in my\\r\\nheart when I was with her just now! And He will judge and will forgive\\r\\nall, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek.... And when He has\\r\\ndone with all of them, then He will summon us. ‘You too come forth,’\\r\\nHe will say, ‘Come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come\\r\\nforth, ye children of shame!’ And we shall all come forth, without shame\\r\\nand shall stand before him. And He will say unto us, ‘Ye are swine, made\\r\\nin the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also!’ And the\\r\\nwise ones and those of understanding will say, ‘Oh Lord, why dost Thou\\r\\nreceive these men?’ And He will say, ‘This is why I receive them, oh ye\\r\\nwise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not one\\r\\nof them believed himself to be worthy of this.’ And He will hold out His\\r\\nhands to us and we shall fall down before him... and we shall weep...\\r\\nand we shall understand all things! Then we shall understand all!... and\\r\\nall will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even... she will understand....\\r\\nLord, Thy kingdom come!” And he sank down on the bench exhausted, and\\r\\nhelpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his surroundings\\r\\nand plunged in deep thought. His words had created a certain impression;\\r\\nthere was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heard\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s his notion!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Talked himself silly!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A fine clerk he is!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so on, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let us go, sir,” said Marmeladov all at once, raising his head and\\r\\naddressing Raskolnikov--“come along with me... Kozel’s house, looking\\r\\ninto the yard. I’m going to Katerina Ivanovna--time I did.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to\\r\\nhelp him. Marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech\\r\\nand leaned heavily on the young man. They had two or three hundred\\r\\npaces to go. The drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and\\r\\nconfusion as they drew nearer the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now,” he muttered in\\r\\nagitation--“and that she will begin pulling my hair. What does my hair\\r\\nmatter! Bother my hair! That’s what I say! Indeed it will be better if\\r\\nshe does begin pulling it, that’s not what I am afraid of... it’s her\\r\\neyes I am afraid of... yes, her eyes... the red on her cheeks, too,\\r\\nfrightens me... and her breathing too.... Have you noticed how people\\r\\nin that disease breathe... when they are excited? I am frightened of\\r\\nthe children’s crying, too.... For if Sonia has not taken them food...\\r\\nI don’t know what’s happened! I don’t know! But blows I am not afraid\\r\\nof.... Know, sir, that such blows are not a pain to me, but even an\\r\\nenjoyment. In fact I can’t get on without it.... It’s better so. Let\\r\\nher strike me, it relieves her heart... it’s better so... There is the\\r\\nhouse. The house of Kozel, the cabinet-maker... a German, well-to-do.\\r\\nLead the way!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey. The staircase\\r\\ngot darker and darker as they went up. It was nearly eleven o’clock\\r\\nand although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night, yet it was\\r\\nquite dark at the top of the stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nA grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar. A very\\r\\npoor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end;\\r\\nthe whole of it was visible from the entrance. It was all in disorder,\\r\\nlittered up with rags of all sorts, especially children’s garments.\\r\\nAcross the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind it\\r\\nprobably was the bed. There was nothing in the room except two chairs\\r\\nand a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, before which\\r\\nstood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and uncovered. At the edge\\r\\nof the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick. It\\r\\nappeared that the family had a room to themselves, not part of a room,\\r\\nbut their room was practically a passage. The door leading to the other\\r\\nrooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia Lippevechsel’s flat was\\r\\ndivided stood half open, and there was shouting, uproar and laughter\\r\\nwithin. People seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there. Words\\r\\nof the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. She was a rather tall,\\r\\nslim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown\\r\\nhair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks. She was pacing up and down\\r\\nin her little room, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips\\r\\nwere parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps. Her eyes\\r\\nglittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare. And\\r\\nthat consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the\\r\\ncandle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression. She seemed to\\r\\nRaskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for\\r\\nMarmeladov.... She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in.\\r\\nShe seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing. The room\\r\\nwas close, but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from the\\r\\nstaircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the inner\\r\\nrooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did not\\r\\nclose the door. The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting\\r\\ncurled up on the floor with her head on the sofa. A boy a year older\\r\\nstood crying and shaking in the corner, probably he had just had a\\r\\nbeating. Beside him stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin,\\r\\nwearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung\\r\\nover her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees.\\r\\nHer arm, as thin as a stick, was round her brother’s neck. She was\\r\\ntrying to comfort him, whispering something to him, and doing all she\\r\\ncould to keep him from whimpering again. At the same time her large\\r\\ndark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened\\r\\nface, were watching her mother with alarm. Marmeladov did not enter the\\r\\ndoor, but dropped on his knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikov\\r\\nin front of him. The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently\\r\\nfacing him, coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what\\r\\nhe had come for. But evidently she decided that he was going into\\r\\nthe next room, as he had to pass through hers to get there. Taking no\\r\\nfurther notice of him, she walked towards the outer door to close it\\r\\nand uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the\\r\\ndoorway.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah!” she cried out in a frenzy, “he has come back! The criminal! the\\r\\nmonster!... And where is the money? What’s in your pocket, show me! And\\r\\nyour clothes are all different! Where are your clothes? Where is the\\r\\nmoney! Speak!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she fell to searching him. Marmeladov submissively and obediently\\r\\nheld up both arms to facilitate the search. Not a farthing was there.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where is the money?” she cried--“Mercy on us, can he have drunk it all?\\r\\nThere were twelve silver roubles left in the chest!” and in a fury\\r\\nshe seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room. Marmeladov\\r\\nseconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me, but is a\\r\\npositive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir,” he called out, shaken to and\\r\\nfro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead.\\r\\nThe child asleep on the floor woke up, and began to cry. The boy in the\\r\\ncorner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed\\r\\nto his sister in violent terror, almost in a fit. The eldest girl was\\r\\nshaking like a leaf.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s drunk it! he’s drunk it all,” the poor woman screamed in\\r\\ndespair--“and his clothes are gone! And they are hungry, hungry!”--and\\r\\nwringing her hands she pointed to the children. “Oh, accursed life!\\r\\nAnd you, are you not ashamed?”--she pounced all at once upon\\r\\nRaskolnikov--“from the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You have\\r\\nbeen drinking with him, too! Go away!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man was hastening away without uttering a word. The inner door\\r\\nwas thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it. Coarse\\r\\nlaughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust\\r\\nthemselves in at the doorway. Further in could be seen figures in\\r\\ndressing gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, some of\\r\\nthem with cards in their hands. They were particularly diverted, when\\r\\nMarmeladov, dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolation\\r\\nto him. They even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrill\\r\\noutcry was heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her\\r\\nway amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and\\r\\nfor the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her\\r\\nwith coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day. As he went out,\\r\\nRaskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket, to snatch up the\\r\\ncoppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to\\r\\nlay them unnoticed on the window. Afterwards on the stairs, he changed\\r\\nhis mind and would have gone back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a stupid thing I’ve done,” he thought to himself, “they have Sonia\\r\\nand I want it myself.” But reflecting that it would be impossible to\\r\\ntake it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it, he\\r\\ndismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging.\\r\\n“Sonia wants pomatum too,” he said as he walked along the street, and he\\r\\nlaughed malignantly--“such smartness costs money.... Hm! And maybe Sonia\\r\\nherself will be bankrupt to-day, for there is always a risk, hunting\\r\\nbig game... digging for gold... then they would all be without a crust\\r\\nto-morrow except for my money. Hurrah for Sonia! What a mine they’ve dug\\r\\nthere! And they’re making the most of it! Yes, they are making the most\\r\\nof it! They’ve wept over it and grown used to it. Man grows used to\\r\\neverything, the scoundrel!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sank into thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what if I am wrong,” he cried suddenly after a moment’s thought.\\r\\n“What if man is not really a scoundrel, man in general, I mean, the\\r\\nwhole race of mankind--then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificial\\r\\nterrors and there are no barriers and it’s all as it should be.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\nHe waked up late next day after a broken sleep. But his sleep had not\\r\\nrefreshed him; he waked up bilious, irritable, ill-tempered, and looked\\r\\nwith hatred at his room. It was a tiny cupboard of a room about six\\r\\npaces in length. It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty\\r\\nyellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that a man\\r\\nof more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment\\r\\nthat he would knock his head against the ceiling. The furniture was in\\r\\nkeeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; a\\r\\npainted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books;\\r\\nthe dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long\\r\\nuntouched. A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and\\r\\nhalf the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz, but\\r\\nwas now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed. Often he went to sleep\\r\\non it, as he was, without undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his old\\r\\nstudent’s overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under which he\\r\\nheaped up all the linen he had, clean and dirty, by way of a bolster. A\\r\\nlittle table stood in front of the sofa.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder, but to\\r\\nRaskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable.\\r\\nHe had got completely away from everyone, like a tortoise in its shell,\\r\\nand even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked\\r\\nsometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation. He was\\r\\nin the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated\\r\\nupon one thing. His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending\\r\\nhim in meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her,\\r\\nthough he went without his dinner. Nastasya, the cook and only servant,\\r\\nwas rather pleased at the lodger’s mood and had entirely given up\\r\\nsweeping and doing his room, only once a week or so she would stray into\\r\\nhis room with a broom. She waked him up that day.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get up, why are you asleep?” she called to him. “It’s past nine, I have\\r\\nbrought you some tea; will you have a cup? I should think you’re fairly\\r\\nstarving?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov opened his eyes, started and recognised Nastasya.\\r\\n\\r\\n“From the landlady, eh?” he asked, slowly and with a sickly face sitting\\r\\nup on the sofa.\\r\\n\\r\\n“From the landlady, indeed!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and\\r\\nlaid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here, Nastasya, take it please,” he said, fumbling in his pocket (for\\r\\nhe had slept in his clothes) and taking out a handful of coppers--“run\\r\\nand buy me a loaf. And get me a little sausage, the cheapest, at the\\r\\npork-butcher’s.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The loaf I’ll fetch you this very minute, but wouldn’t you rather have\\r\\nsome cabbage soup instead of sausage? It’s capital soup, yesterday’s. I\\r\\nsaved it for you yesterday, but you came in late. It’s fine soup.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the soup had been brought, and he had begun upon it, Nastasya\\r\\nsat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting. She was a country\\r\\npeasant-woman and a very talkative one.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Praskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the police about you,” she\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe scowled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To the police? What does she want?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t pay her money and you won’t turn out of the room. That’s what\\r\\nshe wants, to be sure.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The devil, that’s the last straw,” he muttered, grinding his teeth,\\r\\n“no, that would not suit me... just now. She is a fool,” he added aloud.\\r\\n“I’ll go and talk to her to-day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fool she is and no mistake, just as I am. But why, if you are so\\r\\nclever, do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it? One\\r\\ntime you used to go out, you say, to teach children. But why is it you\\r\\ndo nothing now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am doing...” Raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you doing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Work...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What sort of work?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am thinking,” he answered seriously after a pause.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter. She was given to laughter\\r\\nand when anything amused her, she laughed inaudibly, quivering and\\r\\nshaking all over till she felt ill.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And have you made much money by your thinking?” she managed to\\r\\narticulate at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One can’t go out to give lessons without boots. And I’m sick of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t quarrel with your bread and butter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They pay so little for lessons. What’s the use of a few coppers?” he\\r\\nanswered, reluctantly, as though replying to his own thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you want to get a fortune all at once?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her strangely.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I want a fortune,” he answered firmly, after a brief pause.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t be in such a hurry, you quite frighten me! Shall I get you the\\r\\nloaf or not?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As you please.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, I forgot! A letter came for you yesterday when you were out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A letter? for me! from whom?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t say. I gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it. Will\\r\\nyou pay me back?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then bring it to me, for God’s sake, bring it,” cried Raskolnikov\\r\\ngreatly excited--“good God!”\\r\\n\\r\\nA minute later the letter was brought him. That was it: from his mother,\\r\\nfrom the province of R----. He turned pale when he took it. It was a\\r\\nlong while since he had received a letter, but another feeling also\\r\\nsuddenly stabbed his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nastasya, leave me alone, for goodness’ sake; here are your three\\r\\ncopecks, but for goodness’ sake, make haste and go!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letter was quivering in his hand; he did not want to open it in her\\r\\npresence; he wanted to be left _alone_ with this letter. When Nastasya\\r\\nhad gone out, he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it; then he\\r\\ngazed intently at the address, the small, sloping handwriting, so dear\\r\\nand familiar, of the mother who had once taught him to read and write.\\r\\nHe delayed; he seemed almost afraid of something. At last he opened it;\\r\\nit was a thick heavy letter, weighing over two ounces, two large sheets\\r\\nof note paper were covered with very small handwriting.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear Rodya,” wrote his mother--“it’s two months since I last had a\\r\\ntalk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me\\r\\nawake at night, thinking. But I am sure you will not blame me for my\\r\\ninevitable silence. You know how I love you; you are all we have to look\\r\\nto, Dounia and I, you are our all, our one hope, our one stay. What a\\r\\ngrief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the university\\r\\nsome months ago, for want of means to keep yourself and that you had\\r\\nlost your lessons and your other work! How could I help you out of my\\r\\nhundred and twenty roubles a year pension? The fifteen roubles I sent\\r\\nyou four months ago I borrowed, as you know, on security of my pension,\\r\\nfrom Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of this town. He is a\\r\\nkind-hearted man and was a friend of your father’s too. But having given\\r\\nhim the right to receive the pension, I had to wait till the debt was\\r\\npaid off and that is only just done, so that I’ve been unable to send\\r\\nyou anything all this time. But now, thank God, I believe I shall\\r\\nbe able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate\\r\\nourselves on our good fortune now, of which I hasten to inform you. In\\r\\nthe first place, would you have guessed, dear Rodya, that your sister\\r\\nhas been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be\\r\\nseparated in the future. Thank God, her sufferings are over, but I will\\r\\ntell you everything in order, so that you may know just how everything\\r\\nhas happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you. When you\\r\\nwrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dounia had a great\\r\\ndeal to put up with in the Svidrigaïlovs’ house, when you wrote that\\r\\nand asked me to tell you all about it--what could I write in answer to\\r\\nyou? If I had written the whole truth to you, I dare say you would have\\r\\nthrown up everything and have come to us, even if you had to walk all\\r\\nthe way, for I know your character and your feelings, and you would not\\r\\nlet your sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what could I\\r\\ndo? And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then. What\\r\\nmade it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roubles\\r\\nin advance when she took the place as governess in their family, on\\r\\ncondition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so it\\r\\nwas impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt.\\r\\nThis sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya) she took\\r\\nchiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly\\r\\nthen and which you received from us last year. We deceived you then,\\r\\nwriting that this money came from Dounia’s savings, but that was not\\r\\nso, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things have\\r\\nsuddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dounia loves\\r\\nyou and what a heart she has. At first indeed Mr. Svidrigaïlov treated\\r\\nher very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at\\r\\ntable.... But I don’t want to go into all those painful details, so as\\r\\nnot to worry you for nothing when it is now all over. In short, in spite\\r\\nof the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s\\r\\nwife, and all the rest of the household, Dounia had a very hard time,\\r\\nespecially when Mr. Svidrigaïlov, relapsing into his old regimental\\r\\nhabits, was under the influence of Bacchus. And how do you think it\\r\\nwas all explained later on? Would you believe that the crazy fellow had\\r\\nconceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, but had concealed\\r\\nit under a show of rudeness and contempt. Possibly he was ashamed and\\r\\nhorrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years and\\r\\nhis being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia.\\r\\nAnd possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide\\r\\nthe truth from others. But at last he lost all control and had the face\\r\\nto make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts of\\r\\ninducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her\\r\\nto another estate of his, or even abroad. You can imagine all she went\\r\\nthrough! To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on\\r\\naccount of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of Marfa\\r\\nPetrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Dounia\\r\\nwould have been the cause of a rupture in the family. And it would\\r\\nhave meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been\\r\\ninevitable. There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could\\r\\nnot hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. You know\\r\\nDounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she\\r\\nhas. Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases\\r\\nshe has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. She did not even write\\r\\nto me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were\\r\\nconstantly in communication. It all ended very unexpectedly. Marfa\\r\\nPetrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the\\r\\ngarden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw\\r\\nthe blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all. An awful\\r\\nscene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna\\r\\nwent so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was\\r\\nshouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should\\r\\nbe packed off at once to me in a plain peasant’s cart, into which they\\r\\nflung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without\\r\\nfolding it up and packing it. And a heavy shower of rain came on, too,\\r\\nand Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an\\r\\nopen cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think now what answer\\r\\ncould I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and\\r\\nwhat could I have written? I was in despair; I dared not write to\\r\\nyou the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortified\\r\\nand indignant, and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps ruin\\r\\nyourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letter\\r\\nwith trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I could not. For a\\r\\nwhole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came\\r\\nto such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account\\r\\nof the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about\\r\\nus. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in the\\r\\nstreet, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to\\r\\ninsult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch,\\r\\nso that the landlord began to tell us we must leave. All this was set\\r\\ngoing by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at\\r\\nher in every family. She knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and that\\r\\nmonth she was continually coming into the town, and as she is\\r\\nrather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and\\r\\nparticularly of complaining to all and each of her husband--which is not\\r\\nat all right--so in a short time she had spread her story not only in\\r\\nthe town, but over the whole surrounding district. It made me ill, but\\r\\nDounia bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen how\\r\\nshe endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up! She is\\r\\nan angel! But by God’s mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr.\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov returned to his senses and repented and, probably\\r\\nfeeling sorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and\\r\\nunmistakable proof of Dounia’s innocence, in the form of a letter Dounia\\r\\nhad been forced to write and give to him, before Marfa Petrovna\\r\\ncame upon them in the garden. This letter, which remained in Mr.\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov’s hands after her departure, she had written to refuse\\r\\npersonal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreating\\r\\nher. In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation\\r\\nfor the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna, reminding\\r\\nhim that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how\\r\\ninfamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl,\\r\\nunhappy enough already. Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and\\r\\ntouchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot\\r\\nread it without tears. Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too,\\r\\ncleared Dounia’s reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more\\r\\nthan Mr. Svidrigaïlov had himself supposed--as indeed is always the case\\r\\nwith servants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and ‘again\\r\\ncrushed’ as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of\\r\\nDounia’s innocence. The very next day, being Sunday, she went straight\\r\\nto the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give\\r\\nher strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then she\\r\\ncame straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, wept\\r\\nbitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and besought her to\\r\\nforgive her. The same morning without any delay, she went round to all\\r\\nthe houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in\\r\\nthe most flattering terms Dounia’s innocence and the nobility of\\r\\nher feelings and her behavior. What was more, she showed and read to\\r\\neveryone the letter in Dounia’s own handwriting to Mr. Svidrigaïlov and\\r\\neven allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think was\\r\\nsuperfluous. In this way she was busy for several days in driving about\\r\\nthe whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence\\r\\nhaving been given to others. And therefore they had to take turns, so\\r\\nthat in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone\\r\\nknew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the\\r\\nletter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading\\r\\nof it, even many who had heard it several times already both in their\\r\\nown houses and in other people’s. In my opinion a great deal, a very\\r\\ngreat deal of all this was unnecessary; but that’s Marfa Petrovna’s\\r\\ncharacter. Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounia’s\\r\\nreputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible\\r\\ndisgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I really\\r\\nbegan to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too\\r\\nharshly. Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families,\\r\\nbut she refused. All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked\\r\\nrespect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may\\r\\nsay, our whole fortunes are now transformed. You must know, dear Rodya,\\r\\nthat Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry\\r\\nhim. I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been\\r\\narranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved\\r\\nwith me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we\\r\\ncould not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you. And you\\r\\ncould not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. This\\r\\nwas how it happened. He is already of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who\\r\\nhas been very active in bringing the match about. It began with his\\r\\nexpressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance. He was\\r\\nproperly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent\\r\\nus a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a\\r\\nspeedy and decided answer. He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry\\r\\nto get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. At first,\\r\\nof course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly\\r\\nand unexpectedly. We thought and talked it over the whole day. He is a\\r\\nwell-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government\\r\\nand has already made his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five years\\r\\nold, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be\\r\\nthought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and\\r\\npresentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.\\r\\nBut possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight.\\r\\nAnd beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will\\r\\ndo, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if\\r\\nthere is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I give you this\\r\\nwarning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression\\r\\nupon you. Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be\\r\\ndeliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas,\\r\\nwhich are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards. And Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man.\\r\\nAt his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but\\r\\nstill he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions ‘of our\\r\\nmost rising generation’ and he is an opponent of all prejudices. He\\r\\nsaid a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be\\r\\nlistened to, but this is scarcely a vice. I, of course, understood very\\r\\nlittle of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man\\r\\nof great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured. You know\\r\\nyour sister’s character, Rodya. She is a resolute, sensible, patient and\\r\\ngenerous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know very well.\\r\\nOf course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, but\\r\\nDounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make\\r\\nit her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her\\r\\nhappiness his care. Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though it\\r\\nmust be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste. Besides he\\r\\nis a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, that\\r\\nhis own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with\\r\\nhim. And as for some defects of character, for some habits and even\\r\\ncertain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even in\\r\\nthe happiest marriages--Dounia has said that, as regards all that, she\\r\\nrelies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and\\r\\nthat she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future\\r\\nrelationship can be an honourable and straightforward one. He struck me,\\r\\nfor instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come\\r\\nfrom his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is. For\\r\\ninstance, at his second visit, after he had received Dounia’s consent,\\r\\nin the course of conversation, he declared that before making\\r\\nDounia’s acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of\\r\\ngood reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced\\r\\npoverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his\\r\\nwife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her\\r\\nbenefactor. I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely\\r\\nthan I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only\\r\\nremember the meaning. And, besides, it was obviously not said of design,\\r\\nbut slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwards\\r\\nto correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike\\r\\nme as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia. But Dounia was\\r\\nvexed, and answered that ‘words are not deeds,’ and that, of course, is\\r\\nperfectly true. Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up\\r\\nher mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and was\\r\\nwalking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before\\r\\nthe ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me\\r\\nthat she had decided.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for\\r\\nPetersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to open\\r\\na legal bureau. He has been occupied for many years in conducting civil\\r\\nand commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an important\\r\\ncase. He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case before\\r\\nthe Senate. So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in\\r\\nevery way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day\\r\\nyou could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that\\r\\nyour future is marked out and assured for you. Oh, if only this comes to\\r\\npass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a\\r\\nprovidential blessing. Dounia is dreaming of nothing else. We have even\\r\\nventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch.\\r\\nHe was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could not\\r\\nget on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to\\r\\na relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for the\\r\\nduties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!) but then\\r\\nhe expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave\\r\\nyou time for work at his office. The matter dropped for the time, but\\r\\nDounia is thinking of nothing else now. She has been in a sort of fever\\r\\nfor the last few days, and has already made a regular plan for\\r\\nyour becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch’s business, which might well be, seeing that you are a\\r\\nstudent of law. I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and share\\r\\nall her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of\\r\\nrealising them. And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitch’s evasiveness, very\\r\\nnatural at present (since he does not know you), Dounia is firmly\\r\\npersuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her\\r\\nfuture husband; this she is reckoning upon. Of course we are careful\\r\\nnot to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch,\\r\\nespecially of your becoming his partner. He is a practical man and might\\r\\ntake this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream. Nor\\r\\nhas either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have\\r\\nof his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken\\r\\nof it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself,\\r\\nlater on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of\\r\\nhimself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily since\\r\\nyou may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, and\\r\\nreceive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your\\r\\nown work. Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree\\r\\nwith her. And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, that\\r\\nis, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when\\r\\nyou first meet him. When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about\\r\\nyou, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing\\r\\nhim close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own\\r\\nopinion when he makes your acquaintance. Do you know, my precious\\r\\nRodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish,\\r\\nfancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with\\r\\nthem, after the wedding. I am convinced that he will be generous and\\r\\ndelicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter\\r\\nfor the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it is\\r\\nsimply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse. I have\\r\\nnoticed more than once in my life that husbands don’t quite get on with\\r\\ntheir mothers-in-law, and I don’t want to be the least bit in anyone’s\\r\\nway, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so\\r\\nlong as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and\\r\\nDounia. If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most\\r\\njoyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter:\\r\\nknow then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a\\r\\nvery short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of\\r\\nalmost three years! It is settled _for certain_ that Dounia and I are to\\r\\nset off for Petersburg, exactly when I don’t know, but very, very soon,\\r\\npossibly in a week. It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us\\r\\nknow when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg. To suit his\\r\\nown arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible,\\r\\neven before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that is\\r\\ntoo soon to be ready, immediately after. Oh, with what happiness I shall\\r\\npress you to my heart! Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought\\r\\nof seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch for that alone. She is an angel! She is not writing\\r\\nanything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much,\\r\\nso much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, for\\r\\na few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting\\r\\nherself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. But\\r\\nalthough we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as much\\r\\nmoney as I can in a day or two. Now that everyone has heard that Dounia\\r\\nis to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has suddenly improved and I know\\r\\nthat Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles\\r\\non the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to send\\r\\nyou twenty-five or even thirty roubles. I would send you more, but I am\\r\\nuneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has\\r\\nbeen so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, that\\r\\nis to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big\\r\\ntrunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his), we\\r\\nmust reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where we\\r\\ncan’t be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days. But\\r\\nwe have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we see\\r\\nthat the journey will not cost very much. It is only ninety versts from\\r\\nus to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we\\r\\nknow, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travel\\r\\nquite comfortably third class. So that I may very likely be able to send\\r\\nto you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles. But enough; I have covered\\r\\ntwo sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole\\r\\nhistory, but so many events have happened! And now, my precious Rodya,\\r\\nI embrace you and send you a mother’s blessing till we meet. Love Dounia\\r\\nyour sister, Rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that she\\r\\nloves you beyond everything, more than herself. She is an angel and you,\\r\\nRodya, you are everything to us--our one hope, our one consolation. If\\r\\nonly you are happy, we shall be happy. Do you still say your prayers,\\r\\nRodya, and believe in the mercy of our Creator and our Redeemer? I am\\r\\nafraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of\\r\\ninfidelity that is abroad to-day; If it is so, I pray for you. Remember,\\r\\ndear boy, how in your childhood, when your father was living, you used\\r\\nto lisp your prayers at my knee, and how happy we all were in those\\r\\ndays. Good-bye, till we meet then--I embrace you warmly, warmly, with\\r\\nmany kisses.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yours till death,\\r\\n\\r\\n“PULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost from the first, while he read the letter, Raskolnikov’s face was\\r\\nwet with tears; but when he finished it, his face was pale and distorted\\r\\nand a bitter, wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips. He laid his\\r\\nhead down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered, pondered a long\\r\\ntime. His heart was beating violently, and his brain was in a turmoil.\\r\\nAt last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was\\r\\nlike a cupboard or a box. His eyes and his mind craved for space. He\\r\\ntook up his hat and went out, this time without dread of meeting\\r\\nanyone; he had forgotten his dread. He turned in the direction of the\\r\\nVassilyevsky Ostrov, walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect, as though\\r\\nhastening on some business, but he walked, as his habit was, without\\r\\nnoticing his way, muttering and even speaking aloud to himself, to the\\r\\nastonishment of the passers-by. Many of them took him to be drunk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nHis mother’s letter had been a torture to him, but as regards the chief\\r\\nfact in it, he had felt not one moment’s hesitation, even whilst he was\\r\\nreading the letter. The essential question was settled, and irrevocably\\r\\nsettled, in his mind: “Never such a marriage while I am alive and\\r\\nMr. Luzhin be damned!” “The thing is perfectly clear,” he muttered\\r\\nto himself, with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his\\r\\ndecision. “No, mother, no, Dounia, you won’t deceive me! and then they\\r\\napologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without\\r\\nme! I dare say! They imagine it is arranged now and can’t be broken\\r\\noff; but we will see whether it can or not! A magnificent excuse:\\r\\n‘Pyotr Petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be in\\r\\npost-haste, almost by express.’ No, Dounia, I see it all and I know what\\r\\nyou want to say to me; and I know too what you were thinking about, when\\r\\nyou walked up and down all night, and what your prayers were like before\\r\\nthe Holy Mother of Kazan who stands in mother’s bedroom. Bitter is\\r\\nthe ascent to Golgotha.... Hm... so it is finally settled; you have\\r\\ndetermined to marry a sensible business man, Avdotya Romanovna, one\\r\\nwho has a fortune (has _already_ made his fortune, that is so much\\r\\nmore solid and impressive), a man who holds two government posts and who\\r\\nshares the ideas of our most rising generation, as mother writes, and\\r\\nwho _seems_ to be kind, as Dounia herself observes. That _seems_ beats\\r\\neverything! And that very Dounia for that very ‘_seems_’ is marrying\\r\\nhim! Splendid! splendid!\\r\\n\\r\\n“... But I should like to know why mother has written to me about ‘our\\r\\nmost rising generation’? Simply as a descriptive touch, or with the idea\\r\\nof prepossessing me in favour of Mr. Luzhin? Oh, the cunning of them!\\r\\nI should like to know one thing more: how far they were open with one\\r\\nanother that day and night and all this time since? Was it all put into\\r\\n_words_, or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart\\r\\nand in their minds, so that there was no need to speak of it aloud, and\\r\\nbetter not to speak of it. Most likely it was partly like that, from\\r\\nmother’s letter it’s evident: he struck her as rude _a little_, and\\r\\nmother in her simplicity took her observations to Dounia. And she was\\r\\nsure to be vexed and ‘answered her angrily.’ I should think so! Who\\r\\nwould not be angered when it was quite clear without any naïve questions\\r\\nand when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it. And why\\r\\ndoes she write to me, ‘love Dounia, Rodya, and she loves you more than\\r\\nherself’? Has she a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughter\\r\\nto her son? ‘You are our one comfort, you are everything to us.’ Oh,\\r\\nmother!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis bitterness grew more and more intense, and if he had happened to\\r\\nmeet Mr. Luzhin at the moment, he might have murdered him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hm... yes, that’s true,” he continued, pursuing the whirling ideas that\\r\\nchased each other in his brain, “it is true that ‘it needs time and care\\r\\nto get to know a man,’ but there is no mistake about Mr. Luzhin. The\\r\\nchief thing is he is ‘a man of business and _seems_ kind,’ that was\\r\\nsomething, wasn’t it, to send the bags and big box for them! A kind man,\\r\\nno doubt after that! But his _bride_ and her mother are to drive in a\\r\\npeasant’s cart covered with sacking (I know, I have been driven in\\r\\nit). No matter! It is only ninety versts and then they can ‘travel very\\r\\ncomfortably, third class,’ for a thousand versts! Quite right, too. One\\r\\nmust cut one’s coat according to one’s cloth, but what about you, Mr.\\r\\nLuzhin? She is your bride.... And you must be aware that her mother has\\r\\nto raise money on her pension for the journey. To be sure it’s a matter\\r\\nof business, a partnership for mutual benefit, with equal shares and\\r\\nexpenses;--food and drink provided, but pay for your tobacco. The\\r\\nbusiness man has got the better of them, too. The luggage will cost less\\r\\nthan their fares and very likely go for nothing. How is it that they\\r\\ndon’t both see all that, or is it that they don’t want to see? And\\r\\nthey are pleased, pleased! And to think that this is only the first\\r\\nblossoming, and that the real fruits are to come! But what really\\r\\nmatters is not the stinginess, is not the meanness, but the _tone_\\r\\nof the whole thing. For that will be the tone after marriage, it’s a\\r\\nforetaste of it. And mother too, why should she be so lavish? What will\\r\\nshe have by the time she gets to Petersburg? Three silver roubles or\\r\\ntwo ‘paper ones’ as _she_ says.... that old woman... hm. What does\\r\\nshe expect to live upon in Petersburg afterwards? She has her reasons\\r\\nalready for guessing that she _could not_ live with Dounia after the\\r\\nmarriage, even for the first few months. The good man has no doubt let\\r\\nslip something on that subject also, though mother would deny it: ‘I\\r\\nshall refuse,’ says she. On whom is she reckoning then? Is she counting\\r\\non what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension when\\r\\nAfanasy Ivanovitch’s debt is paid? She knits woollen shawls and\\r\\nembroiders cuffs, ruining her old eyes. And all her shawls don’t add\\r\\nmore than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty, I know\\r\\nthat. So she is building all her hopes all the time on Mr. Luzhin’s\\r\\ngenerosity; ‘he will offer it of himself, he will press it on me.’\\r\\nYou may wait a long time for that! That’s how it always is with these\\r\\nSchilleresque noble hearts; till the last moment every goose is a swan\\r\\nwith them, till the last moment, they hope for the best and will see\\r\\nnothing wrong, and although they have an inkling of the other side of\\r\\nthe picture, yet they won’t face the truth till they are forced to; the\\r\\nvery thought of it makes them shiver; they thrust the truth away with\\r\\nboth hands, until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool’s\\r\\ncap on them with his own hands. I should like to know whether Mr. Luzhin\\r\\nhas any orders of merit; I bet he has the Anna in his buttonhole and\\r\\nthat he puts it on when he goes to dine with contractors or merchants.\\r\\nHe will be sure to have it for his wedding, too! Enough of him, confound\\r\\nhim!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,... mother I don’t wonder at, it’s like her, God bless her, but\\r\\nhow could Dounia? Dounia darling, as though I did not know you! You were\\r\\nnearly twenty when I saw you last: I understood you then. Mother writes\\r\\nthat ‘Dounia can put up with a great deal.’ I know that very well. I\\r\\nknew that two years and a half ago, and for the last two and a half\\r\\nyears I have been thinking about it, thinking of just that, that ‘Dounia\\r\\ncan put up with a great deal.’ If she could put up with Mr. Svidrigaïlov\\r\\nand all the rest of it, she certainly can put up with a great deal. And\\r\\nnow mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put up\\r\\nwith Mr. Luzhin, who propounds the theory of the superiority of\\r\\nwives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband’s\\r\\nbounty--who propounds it, too, almost at the first interview. Granted\\r\\nthat he ‘let it slip,’ though he is a sensible man, (yet maybe it\\r\\nwas not a slip at all, but he meant to make himself clear as soon as\\r\\npossible) but Dounia, Dounia? She understands the man, of course, but\\r\\nshe will have to live with the man. Why! she’d live on black bread\\r\\nand water, she would not sell her soul, she would not barter her moral\\r\\nfreedom for comfort; she would not barter it for all Schleswig-Holstein,\\r\\nmuch less Mr. Luzhin’s money. No, Dounia was not that sort when I knew\\r\\nher and... she is still the same, of course! Yes, there’s no denying,\\r\\nthe Svidrigaïlovs are a bitter pill! It’s a bitter thing to spend one’s\\r\\nlife a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles, but I know\\r\\nshe would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a Lett with a German\\r\\nmaster than degrade her soul, and her moral dignity, by binding herself\\r\\nfor ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she has\\r\\nnothing in common--for her own advantage. And if Mr. Luzhin had been of\\r\\nunalloyed gold, or one huge diamond, she would never have consented to\\r\\nbecome his legal concubine. Why is she consenting then? What’s the\\r\\npoint of it? What’s the answer? It’s clear enough: for herself, for her\\r\\ncomfort, to save her life she would not sell herself, but for someone\\r\\nelse she is doing it! For one she loves, for one she adores, she will\\r\\nsell herself! That’s what it all amounts to; for her brother, for her\\r\\nmother, she will sell herself! She will sell everything! In such cases,\\r\\n‘we overcome our moral feeling if necessary,’ freedom, peace, conscience\\r\\neven, all, all are brought into the market. Let my life go, if only my\\r\\ndear ones may be happy! More than that, we become casuists, we learn\\r\\nto be Jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves, we can\\r\\npersuade ourselves that it is one’s duty for a good object. That’s just\\r\\nlike us, it’s as clear as daylight. It’s clear that Rodion Romanovitch\\r\\nRaskolnikov is the central figure in the business, and no one else. Oh,\\r\\nyes, she can ensure his happiness, keep him in the university, make him\\r\\na partner in the office, make his whole future secure; perhaps he may\\r\\neven be a rich man later on, prosperous, respected, and may even end his\\r\\nlife a famous man! But my mother? It’s all Rodya, precious Rodya, her\\r\\nfirst born! For such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter! Oh,\\r\\nloving, over-partial hearts! Why, for his sake we would not shrink even\\r\\nfrom Sonia’s fate. Sonia, Sonia Marmeladov, the eternal victim so long\\r\\nas the world lasts. Have you taken the measure of your sacrifice, both\\r\\nof you? Is it right? Can you bear it? Is it any use? Is there sense in\\r\\nit? And let me tell you, Dounia, Sonia’s life is no worse than life with\\r\\nMr. Luzhin. ‘There can be no question of love,’ mother writes. And what\\r\\nif there can be no respect either, if on the contrary there is aversion,\\r\\ncontempt, repulsion, what then? So you will have to ‘keep up your\\r\\nappearance,’ too. Is not that so? Do you understand what that smartness\\r\\nmeans? Do you understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the same\\r\\nthing as Sonia’s and may be worse, viler, baser, because in your case,\\r\\nDounia, it’s a bargain for luxuries, after all, but with Sonia it’s\\r\\nsimply a question of starvation. It has to be paid for, it has to be\\r\\npaid for, Dounia, this smartness. And what if it’s more than you can\\r\\nbear afterwards, if you regret it? The bitterness, the misery, the\\r\\ncurses, the tears hidden from all the world, for you are not a Marfa\\r\\nPetrovna. And how will your mother feel then? Even now she is uneasy,\\r\\nshe is worried, but then, when she sees it all clearly? And I? Yes,\\r\\nindeed, what have you taken me for? I won’t have your sacrifice, Dounia,\\r\\nI won’t have it, mother! It shall not be, so long as I am alive, it\\r\\nshall not, it shall not! I won’t accept it!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It shall not be? But what are you going to do to prevent it? You’ll\\r\\nforbid it? And what right have you? What can you promise them on your\\r\\nside to give you such a right? Your whole life, your whole future, you\\r\\nwill devote to them _when you have finished your studies and obtained a\\r\\npost_? Yes, we have heard all that before, and that’s all _words_, but\\r\\nnow? Now something must be done, now, do you understand that? And\\r\\nwhat are you doing now? You are living upon them. They borrow on their\\r\\nhundred roubles pension. They borrow from the Svidrigaïlovs. How are\\r\\nyou going to save them from Svidrigaïlovs, from Afanasy Ivanovitch\\r\\nVahrushin, oh, future millionaire Zeus who would arrange their lives for\\r\\nthem? In another ten years? In another ten years, mother will be blind\\r\\nwith knitting shawls, maybe with weeping too. She will be worn to a\\r\\nshadow with fasting; and my sister? Imagine for a moment what may have\\r\\nbecome of your sister in ten years? What may happen to her during those\\r\\nten years? Can you fancy?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he tortured himself, fretting himself with such questions, and\\r\\nfinding a kind of enjoyment in it. And yet all these questions were not\\r\\nnew ones suddenly confronting him, they were old familiar aches. It was\\r\\nlong since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart. Long, long\\r\\nago his present anguish had its first beginnings; it had waxed and\\r\\ngathered strength, it had matured and concentrated, until it had taken\\r\\nthe form of a fearful, frenzied and fantastic question, which tortured\\r\\nhis heart and mind, clamouring insistently for an answer. Now his\\r\\nmother’s letter had burst on him like a thunderclap. It was clear\\r\\nthat he must not now suffer passively, worrying himself over unsolved\\r\\nquestions, but that he must do something, do it at once, and do it\\r\\nquickly. Anyway he must decide on something, or else...\\r\\n\\r\\n“Or throw up life altogether!” he cried suddenly, in a frenzy--“accept\\r\\none’s lot humbly as it is, once for all and stifle everything in\\r\\noneself, giving up all claim to activity, life and love!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have\\r\\nabsolutely nowhere to turn?” Marmeladov’s question came suddenly into\\r\\nhis mind, “for every man must have somewhere to turn....”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave a sudden start; another thought, that he had had yesterday,\\r\\nslipped back into his mind. But he did not start at the thought\\r\\nrecurring to him, for he knew, he had _felt beforehand_, that it must\\r\\ncome back, he was expecting it; besides it was not only yesterday’s\\r\\nthought. The difference was that a month ago, yesterday even, the\\r\\nthought was a mere dream: but now... now it appeared not a dream at all,\\r\\nit had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape, and he suddenly\\r\\nbecame aware of this himself.... He felt a hammering in his head, and\\r\\nthere was a darkness before his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked round hurriedly, he was searching for something. He wanted\\r\\nto sit down and was looking for a seat; he was walking along the K----\\r\\nBoulevard. There was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him. He\\r\\nwalked towards it as fast he could; but on the way he met with a little\\r\\nadventure which absorbed all his attention. Looking for the seat, he had\\r\\nnoticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him, but at first\\r\\nhe took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed his\\r\\npath. It had happened to him many times going home not to notice the\\r\\nroad by which he was going, and he was accustomed to walk like that. But\\r\\nthere was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front\\r\\nof him, that gradually his attention was riveted upon her, at first\\r\\nreluctantly and, as it were, resentfully, and then more and more\\r\\nintently. He felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was so\\r\\nstrange about the woman. In the first place, she appeared to be a girl\\r\\nquite young, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with\\r\\nno parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in an absurd way. She had\\r\\non a dress of some light silky material, but put on strangely awry, not\\r\\nproperly hooked up, and torn open at the top of the skirt, close to the\\r\\nwaist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose. A little kerchief was\\r\\nflung about her bare throat, but lay slanting on one side. The girl was\\r\\nwalking unsteadily, too, stumbling and staggering from side to side. She\\r\\ndrew Raskolnikov’s whole attention at last. He overtook the girl at the\\r\\nseat, but, on reaching it, she dropped down on it, in the corner;\\r\\nshe let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes,\\r\\napparently in extreme exhaustion. Looking at her closely, he saw at once\\r\\nthat she was completely drunk. It was a strange and shocking sight. He\\r\\ncould hardly believe that he was not mistaken. He saw before him the\\r\\nface of a quite young, fair-haired girl--sixteen, perhaps not more than\\r\\nfifteen, years old, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy looking\\r\\nand, as it were, swollen. The girl seemed hardly to know what she was\\r\\ndoing; she crossed one leg over the other, lifting it indecorously, and\\r\\nshowed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov did not sit down, but he felt unwilling to leave her,\\r\\nand stood facing her in perplexity. This boulevard was never much\\r\\nfrequented; and now, at two o’clock, in the stifling heat, it was quite\\r\\ndeserted. And yet on the further side of the boulevard, about fifteen\\r\\npaces away, a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement. He,\\r\\ntoo, would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object\\r\\nof his own. He, too, had probably seen her in the distance and had\\r\\nfollowed her, but found Raskolnikov in his way. He looked angrily at\\r\\nhim, though he tried to escape his notice, and stood impatiently biding\\r\\nhis time, till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away. His\\r\\nintentions were unmistakable. The gentleman was a plump, thickly-set\\r\\nman, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips and\\r\\nmoustaches. Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sudden longing to insult\\r\\nthis fat dandy in some way. He left the girl for a moment and walked\\r\\ntowards the gentleman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hey! You Svidrigaïlov! What do you want here?” he shouted, clenching\\r\\nhis fists and laughing, spluttering with rage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean?” the gentleman asked sternly, scowling in haughty\\r\\nastonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get away, that’s what I mean.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How dare you, you low fellow!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe raised his cane. Raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists, without\\r\\nreflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like\\r\\nhimself. But at that instant someone seized him from behind, and a\\r\\npolice constable stood between them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public place. What\\r\\ndo you want? Who are you?” he asked Raskolnikov sternly, noticing his\\r\\nrags.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov looked at him intently. He had a straight-forward, sensible,\\r\\nsoldierly face, with grey moustaches and whiskers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are just the man I want,” Raskolnikov cried, catching at his arm.\\r\\n“I am a student, Raskolnikov.... You may as well know that too,” he\\r\\nadded, addressing the gentleman, “come along, I have something to show\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look here, hopelessly drunk, and she has just come down the boulevard.\\r\\nThere is no telling who and what she is, she does not look like a\\r\\nprofessional. It’s more likely she has been given drink and deceived\\r\\nsomewhere... for the first time... you understand? and they’ve put her\\r\\nout into the street like that. Look at the way her dress is torn, and\\r\\nthe way it has been put on: she has been dressed by somebody, she has\\r\\nnot dressed herself, and dressed by unpractised hands, by a man’s hands;\\r\\nthat’s evident. And now look there: I don’t know that dandy with whom I\\r\\nwas going to fight, I see him for the first time, but he, too, has seen\\r\\nher on the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is doing, and now\\r\\nhe is very eager to get hold of her, to get her away somewhere while she\\r\\nis in this state... that’s certain, believe me, I am not wrong. I saw\\r\\nhim myself watching her and following her, but I prevented him, and he\\r\\nis just waiting for me to go away. Now he has walked away a little, and\\r\\nis standing still, pretending to make a cigarette.... Think how can we\\r\\nkeep her out of his hands, and how are we to get her home?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe policeman saw it all in a flash. The stout gentleman was easy to\\r\\nunderstand, he turned to consider the girl. The policeman bent over to\\r\\nexamine her more closely, and his face worked with genuine compassion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, what a pity!” he said, shaking his head--“why, she is quite a\\r\\nchild! She has been deceived, you can see that at once. Listen, lady,”\\r\\n he began addressing her, “where do you live?” The girl opened her weary\\r\\nand sleepy-looking eyes, gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her\\r\\nhand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here,” said Raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding twenty\\r\\ncopecks, “here, call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address. The\\r\\nonly thing is to find out her address!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Missy, missy!” the policeman began again, taking the money. “I’ll fetch\\r\\nyou a cab and take you home myself. Where shall I take you, eh? Where do\\r\\nyou live?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go away! They won’t let me alone,” the girl muttered, and once more\\r\\nwaved her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ach, ach, how shocking! It’s shameful, missy, it’s a shame!” He shook\\r\\nhis head again, shocked, sympathetic and indignant.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a difficult job,” the policeman said to Raskolnikov, and as he\\r\\ndid so, he looked him up and down in a rapid glance. He, too, must have\\r\\nseemed a strange figure to him: dressed in rags and handing him money!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you meet her far from here?” he asked him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I tell you she was walking in front of me, staggering, just here, in\\r\\nthe boulevard. She only just reached the seat and sank down on it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays, God have\\r\\nmercy on us! An innocent creature like that, drunk already! She has been\\r\\ndeceived, that’s a sure thing. See how her dress has been torn too....\\r\\nAh, the vice one sees nowadays! And as likely as not she belongs to\\r\\ngentlefolk too, poor ones maybe.... There are many like that nowadays.\\r\\nShe looks refined, too, as though she were a lady,” and he bent over her\\r\\nonce more.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps he had daughters growing up like that, “looking like ladies and\\r\\nrefined” with pretensions to gentility and smartness....\\r\\n\\r\\n“The chief thing is,” Raskolnikov persisted, “to keep her out of this\\r\\nscoundrel’s hands! Why should he outrage her! It’s as clear as day what\\r\\nhe is after; ah, the brute, he is not moving off!”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him. The gentleman heard him,\\r\\nand seemed about to fly into a rage again, but thought better of it, and\\r\\nconfined himself to a contemptuous look. He then walked slowly another\\r\\nten paces away and again halted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Keep her out of his hands we can,” said the constable thoughtfully,\\r\\n“if only she’d tell us where to take her, but as it is.... Missy, hey,\\r\\nmissy!” he bent over her once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe opened her eyes fully all of a sudden, looked at him intently, as\\r\\nthough realising something, got up from the seat and walked away in the\\r\\ndirection from which she had come. “Oh shameful wretches, they won’t let\\r\\nme alone!” she said, waving her hand again. She walked quickly, though\\r\\nstaggering as before. The dandy followed her, but along another avenue,\\r\\nkeeping his eye on her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t be anxious, I won’t let him have her,” the policeman said\\r\\nresolutely, and he set off after them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, the vice one sees nowadays!” he repeated aloud, sighing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov; in an instant a\\r\\ncomplete revulsion of feeling came over him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hey, here!” he shouted after the policeman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter turned round.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let them be! What is it to do with you? Let her go! Let him amuse\\r\\nhimself.” He pointed at the dandy, “What is it to do with you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe policeman was bewildered, and stared at him open-eyed. Raskolnikov\\r\\nlaughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well!” ejaculated the policeman, with a gesture of contempt, and he\\r\\nwalked after the dandy and the girl, probably taking Raskolnikov for a\\r\\nmadman or something even worse.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has carried off my twenty copecks,” Raskolnikov murmured angrily\\r\\nwhen he was left alone. “Well, let him take as much from the other\\r\\nfellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end. And why did I\\r\\nwant to interfere? Is it for me to help? Have I any right to help? Let\\r\\nthem devour each other alive--what is it to me? How did I dare to give him\\r\\ntwenty copecks? Were they mine?”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of those strange words he felt very wretched. He sat down on\\r\\nthe deserted seat. His thoughts strayed aimlessly.... He found it hard\\r\\nto fix his mind on anything at that moment. He longed to forget himself\\r\\naltogether, to forget everything, and then to wake up and begin life\\r\\nanew....\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor girl!” he said, looking at the empty corner where she had\\r\\nsat--“She will come to herself and weep, and then her mother will find\\r\\nout.... She will give her a beating, a horrible, shameful beating and\\r\\nthen maybe, turn her out of doors.... And even if she does not, the\\r\\nDarya Frantsovnas will get wind of it, and the girl will soon be\\r\\nslipping out on the sly here and there. Then there will be the hospital\\r\\ndirectly (that’s always the luck of those girls with respectable\\r\\nmothers, who go wrong on the sly) and then... again the hospital...\\r\\ndrink... the taverns... and more hospital, in two or three years--a\\r\\nwreck, and her life over at eighteen or nineteen.... Have not I seen\\r\\ncases like that? And how have they been brought to it? Why, they’ve all\\r\\ncome to it like that. Ugh! But what does it matter? That’s as it should\\r\\nbe, they tell us. A certain percentage, they tell us, must every year\\r\\ngo... that way... to the devil, I suppose, so that the rest may remain\\r\\nchaste, and not be interfered with. A percentage! What splendid words\\r\\nthey have; they are so scientific, so consolatory.... Once you’ve said\\r\\n‘percentage’ there’s nothing more to worry about. If we had any other\\r\\nword... maybe we might feel more uneasy.... But what if Dounia were one\\r\\nof the percentage! Of another one if not that one?\\r\\n\\r\\n“But where am I going?” he thought suddenly. “Strange, I came out for\\r\\nsomething. As soon as I had read the letter I came out.... I was going\\r\\nto Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Razumihin. That’s what it was... now I\\r\\nremember. What for, though? And what put the idea of going to Razumihin\\r\\ninto my head just now? That’s curious.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wondered at himself. Razumihin was one of his old comrades at the\\r\\nuniversity. It was remarkable that Raskolnikov had hardly any friends at\\r\\nthe university; he kept aloof from everyone, went to see no one, and did\\r\\nnot welcome anyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon gave\\r\\nhim up. He took no part in the students’ gatherings, amusements or\\r\\nconversations. He worked with great intensity without sparing himself,\\r\\nand he was respected for this, but no one liked him. He was very poor,\\r\\nand there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as though\\r\\nhe were keeping something to himself. He seemed to some of his comrades\\r\\nto look down upon them all as children, as though he were superior in\\r\\ndevelopment, knowledge and convictions, as though their beliefs and\\r\\ninterests were beneath him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he was more unreserved and\\r\\ncommunicative with him. Indeed it was impossible to be on any other\\r\\nterms with Razumihin. He was an exceptionally good-humoured and candid\\r\\nyouth, good-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth and\\r\\ndignity lay concealed under that simplicity. The better of his comrades\\r\\nunderstood this, and all were fond of him. He was extremely intelligent,\\r\\nthough he was certainly rather a simpleton at times. He was of striking\\r\\nappearance--tall, thin, blackhaired and always badly shaved. He was\\r\\nsometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength.\\r\\nOne night, when out in a festive company, he had with one blow laid\\r\\na gigantic policeman on his back. There was no limit to his drinking\\r\\npowers, but he could abstain from drink altogether; he sometimes went\\r\\ntoo far in his pranks; but he could do without pranks altogether.\\r\\nAnother thing striking about Razumihin, no failure distressed him, and\\r\\nit seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him. He\\r\\ncould lodge anywhere, and bear the extremes of cold and hunger. He was\\r\\nvery poor, and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of\\r\\none sort or another. He knew of no end of resources by which to earn\\r\\nmoney. He spent one whole winter without lighting his stove, and used to\\r\\ndeclare that he liked it better, because one slept more soundly in\\r\\nthe cold. For the present he, too, had been obliged to give up the\\r\\nuniversity, but it was only for a time, and he was working with all his\\r\\nmight to save enough to return to his studies again. Raskolnikov had\\r\\nnot been to see him for the last four months, and Razumihin did not even\\r\\nknow his address. About two months before, they had met in the street,\\r\\nbut Raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that\\r\\nhe might not be observed. And though Razumihin noticed him, he passed\\r\\nhim by, as he did not want to annoy him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course, I’ve been meaning lately to go to Razumihin’s to ask for\\r\\nwork, to ask him to get me lessons or something...” Raskolnikov thought,\\r\\n“but what help can he be to me now? Suppose he gets me lessons, suppose\\r\\nhe shares his last farthing with me, if he has any farthings, so that\\r\\nI could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons...\\r\\nhm... Well and what then? What shall I do with the few coppers I\\r\\nearn? That’s not what I want now. It’s really absurd for me to go to\\r\\nRazumihin....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question why he was now going to Razumihin agitated him even more\\r\\nthan he was himself aware; he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister\\r\\nsignificance in this apparently ordinary action.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Could I have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by\\r\\nmeans of Razumihin alone?” he asked himself in perplexity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pondered and rubbed his forehead, and, strange to say, after long\\r\\nmusing, suddenly, as if it were spontaneously and by chance, a fantastic\\r\\nthought came into his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hm... to Razumihin’s,” he said all at once, calmly, as though he had\\r\\nreached a final determination. “I shall go to Razumihin’s of course,\\r\\nbut... not now. I shall go to him... on the next day after It, when It\\r\\nwill be over and everything will begin afresh....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd suddenly he realised what he was thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\n“After It,” he shouted, jumping up from the seat, “but is It really\\r\\ngoing to happen? Is it possible it really will happen?” He left the\\r\\nseat, and went off almost at a run; he meant to turn back, homewards,\\r\\nbut the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing;\\r\\nin that hole, in that awful little cupboard of his, all _this_ had for a\\r\\nmonth past been growing up in him; and he walked on at random.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel\\r\\nshivering; in spite of the heat he felt cold. With a kind of effort he\\r\\nbegan almost unconsciously, from some inner craving, to stare at all\\r\\nthe objects before him, as though looking for something to distract his\\r\\nattention; but he did not succeed, and kept dropping every moment into\\r\\nbrooding. When with a start he lifted his head again and looked round,\\r\\nhe forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he\\r\\nwas going. In this way he walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov, came\\r\\nout on to the Lesser Neva, crossed the bridge and turned towards the\\r\\nislands. The greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary\\r\\neyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in\\r\\nand weighed upon him. Here there were no taverns, no stifling closeness,\\r\\nno stench. But soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid\\r\\nirritability. Sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer\\r\\nvilla standing among green foliage, he gazed through the fence, he saw\\r\\nin the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies,\\r\\nand children running in the gardens. The flowers especially caught his\\r\\nattention; he gazed at them longer than at anything. He was met, too, by\\r\\nluxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he watched them\\r\\nwith curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from\\r\\nhis sight. Once he stood still and counted his money; he found he had\\r\\nthirty copecks. “Twenty to the policeman, three to Nastasya for the\\r\\nletter, so I must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovs\\r\\nyesterday,” he thought, reckoning it up for some unknown reason, but he\\r\\nsoon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket.\\r\\nHe recalled it on passing an eating-house or tavern, and felt that he\\r\\nwas hungry.... Going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a\\r\\npie of some sort. He finished eating it as he walked away. It was a long\\r\\nwhile since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once,\\r\\nthough he only drank a wineglassful. His legs felt suddenly heavy and\\r\\na great drowsiness came upon him. He turned homewards, but reaching\\r\\nPetrovsky Ostrov he stopped completely exhausted, turned off the road\\r\\ninto the bushes, sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singular\\r\\nactuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance of reality. At times\\r\\nmonstrous images are created, but the setting and the whole picture are\\r\\nso truth-like and filled with details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but\\r\\nso artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist like\\r\\nPushkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them in the waking\\r\\nstate. Such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a\\r\\npowerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov had a fearful dream. He dreamt he was back in his childhood\\r\\nin the little town of his birth. He was a child about seven years old,\\r\\nwalking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday. It\\r\\nwas a grey and heavy day, the country was exactly as he remembered it;\\r\\nindeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in\\r\\nmemory. The little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand, not\\r\\neven a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a dark\\r\\nblur on the very edge of the horizon. A few paces beyond the last market\\r\\ngarden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a\\r\\nfeeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with his father.\\r\\nThere was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse,\\r\\nhideous hoarse singing and often fighting. Drunken and horrible-looking\\r\\nfigures were hanging about the tavern. He used to cling close to his\\r\\nfather, trembling all over when he met them. Near the tavern the road\\r\\nbecame a dusty track, the dust of which was always black. It was a\\r\\nwinding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to the\\r\\nright to the graveyard. In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone\\r\\nchurch with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three\\r\\ntimes a year with his father and mother, when a service was held in\\r\\nmemory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had never\\r\\nseen. On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a\\r\\ntable napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in\\r\\nthe shape of a cross. He loved that church, the old-fashioned, unadorned\\r\\nikons and the old priest with the shaking head. Near his grandmother’s\\r\\ngrave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave of his younger\\r\\nbrother who had died at six months old. He did not remember him at all,\\r\\nbut he had been told about his little brother, and whenever he visited\\r\\nthe graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and\\r\\nto bow down and kiss the little grave. And now he dreamt that he was\\r\\nwalking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he\\r\\nwas holding his father’s hand and looking with dread at the tavern. A\\r\\npeculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to be\\r\\nsome kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressed\\r\\ntownspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts,\\r\\nall singing and all more or less drunk. Near the entrance of the tavern\\r\\nstood a cart, but a strange cart. It was one of those big carts usually\\r\\ndrawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy\\r\\ngoods. He always liked looking at those great cart-horses, with their\\r\\nlong manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect\\r\\nmountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going\\r\\nwith a load than without it. But now, strange to say, in the shafts of\\r\\nsuch a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasants’\\r\\nnags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load\\r\\nof wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in\\r\\na rut. And the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even\\r\\nabout the nose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them that\\r\\nhe almost cried, and his mother always used to take him away from the\\r\\nwindow. All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singing\\r\\nand the balalaïka, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken\\r\\npeasants came out, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over\\r\\ntheir shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get in, get in!” shouted one of them, a young thick-necked peasant with\\r\\na fleshy face red as a carrot. “I’ll take you all, get in!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the\\r\\ncrowd.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Take us all with a beast like that!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, Mikolka, are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And this mare is twenty if she is a day, mates!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get in, I’ll take you all,” Mikolka shouted again, leaping first into\\r\\nthe cart, seizing the reins and standing straight up in front. “The bay\\r\\nhas gone with Matvey,” he shouted from the cart--“and this brute, mates,\\r\\nis just breaking my heart, I feel as if I could kill her. She’s just\\r\\neating her head off. Get in, I tell you! I’ll make her gallop! She’ll\\r\\ngallop!” and he picked up the whip, preparing himself with relish to\\r\\nflog the little mare.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get in! Come along!” The crowd laughed. “D’you hear, she’ll gallop!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gallop indeed! She has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She’ll jog along!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you mind her, mates, bring a whip each of you, get ready!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right! Give it to her!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all clambered into Mikolka’s cart, laughing and making jokes. Six\\r\\nmen got in and there was still room for more. They hauled in a fat,\\r\\nrosy-cheeked woman. She was dressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beaded\\r\\nheaddress and thick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and laughing.\\r\\nThe crowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could they help\\r\\nlaughing? That wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a\\r\\ngallop! Two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to\\r\\nhelp Mikolka. With the cry of “now,” the mare tugged with all her might,\\r\\nbut far from galloping, could scarcely move forward; she struggled with\\r\\nher legs, gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which\\r\\nwere showered upon her like hail. The laughter in the cart and in the\\r\\ncrowd was redoubled, but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed\\r\\nthe mare, as though he supposed she really could gallop.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me get in, too, mates,” shouted a young man in the crowd whose\\r\\nappetite was aroused.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get in, all get in,” cried Mikolka, “she will draw you all. I’ll beat\\r\\nher to death!” And he thrashed and thrashed at the mare, beside himself\\r\\nwith fury.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Father, father,” he cried, “father, what are they doing? Father, they\\r\\nare beating the poor horse!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come along, come along!” said his father. “They are drunken and\\r\\nfoolish, they are in fun; come away, don’t look!” and he tried to draw\\r\\nhim away, but he tore himself away from his hand, and, beside himself\\r\\nwith horror, ran to the horse. The poor beast was in a bad way. She was\\r\\ngasping, standing still, then tugging again and almost falling.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Beat her to death,” cried Mikolka, “it’s come to that. I’ll do for\\r\\nher!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you about, are you a Christian, you devil?” shouted an old man\\r\\nin the crowd.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did anyone ever see the like? A wretched nag like that pulling such a\\r\\ncartload,” said another.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll kill her,” shouted the third.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t meddle! It’s my property, I’ll do what I choose. Get in, more of\\r\\nyou! Get in, all of you! I will have her go at a gallop!...”\\r\\n\\r\\nAll at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything: the mare,\\r\\nroused by the shower of blows, began feebly kicking. Even the old man\\r\\ncould not help smiling. To think of a wretched little beast like that\\r\\ntrying to kick!\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat her\\r\\nabout the ribs. One ran each side.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hit her in the face, in the eyes, in the eyes,” cried Mikolka.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give us a song, mates,” shouted someone in the cart and everyone in the\\r\\ncart joined in a riotous song, jingling a tambourine and whistling. The\\r\\nwoman went on cracking nuts and laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n... He ran beside the mare, ran in front of her, saw her being whipped\\r\\nacross the eyes, right in the eyes! He was crying, he felt choking, his\\r\\ntears were streaming. One of the men gave him a cut with the whip across\\r\\nthe face, he did not feel it. Wringing his hands and screaming, he\\r\\nrushed up to the grey-headed old man with the grey beard, who was\\r\\nshaking his head in disapproval. One woman seized him by the hand and\\r\\nwould have taken him away, but he tore himself from her and ran back to\\r\\nthe mare. She was almost at the last gasp, but began kicking once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll teach you to kick,” Mikolka shouted ferociously. He threw down\\r\\nthe whip, bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long,\\r\\nthick shaft, he took hold of one end with both hands and with an effort\\r\\nbrandished it over the mare.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’ll crush her,” was shouted round him. “He’ll kill her!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s my property,” shouted Mikolka and brought the shaft down with a\\r\\nswinging blow. There was a sound of a heavy thud.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thrash her, thrash her! Why have you stopped?” shouted voices in the\\r\\ncrowd.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time\\r\\non the spine of the luckless mare. She sank back on her haunches, but\\r\\nlurched forward and tugged forward with all her force, tugged first on\\r\\none side and then on the other, trying to move the cart. But the six\\r\\nwhips were attacking her in all directions, and the shaft was raised\\r\\nagain and fell upon her a third time, then a fourth, with heavy measured\\r\\nblows. Mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She’s a tough one,” was shouted in the crowd.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She’ll fall in a minute, mates, there will soon be an end of her,” said\\r\\nan admiring spectator in the crowd.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fetch an axe to her! Finish her off,” shouted a third.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll show you! Stand off,” Mikolka screamed frantically; he threw down\\r\\nthe shaft, stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar. “Look\\r\\nout,” he shouted, and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the\\r\\npoor mare. The blow fell; the mare staggered, sank back, tried to pull,\\r\\nbut the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on\\r\\nthe ground like a log.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Finish her off,” shouted Mikolka and he leapt beside himself, out of\\r\\nthe cart. Several young men, also flushed with drink, seized anything\\r\\nthey could come across--whips, sticks, poles, and ran to the dying\\r\\nmare. Mikolka stood on one side and began dealing random blows with the\\r\\ncrowbar. The mare stretched out her head, drew a long breath and died.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You butchered her,” someone shouted in the crowd.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why wouldn’t she gallop then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My property!” shouted Mikolka, with bloodshot eyes, brandishing the bar\\r\\nin his hands. He stood as though regretting that he had nothing more to\\r\\nbeat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No mistake about it, you are not a Christian,” many voices were\\r\\nshouting in the crowd.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the poor boy, beside himself, made his way, screaming, through the\\r\\ncrowd to the sorrel nag, put his arms round her bleeding dead head and\\r\\nkissed it, kissed the eyes and kissed the lips.... Then he jumped up and\\r\\nflew in a frenzy with his little fists out at Mikolka. At that instant\\r\\nhis father, who had been running after him, snatched him up and carried\\r\\nhim out of the crowd.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come along, come! Let us go home,” he said to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Father! Why did they... kill... the poor horse!” he sobbed, but his\\r\\nvoice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are drunk.... They are brutal... it’s not our business!” said his\\r\\nfather. He put his arms round his father but he felt choked, choked. He\\r\\ntried to draw a breath, to cry out--and woke up.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe waked up, gasping for breath, his hair soaked with perspiration, and\\r\\nstood up in terror.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank God, that was only a dream,” he said, sitting down under a tree\\r\\nand drawing deep breaths. “But what is it? Is it some fever coming on?\\r\\nSuch a hideous dream!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe felt utterly broken: darkness and confusion were in his soul. He\\r\\nrested his elbows on his knees and leaned his head on his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good God!” he cried, “can it be, can it be, that I shall really take an\\r\\naxe, that I shall strike her on the head, split her skull open... that I\\r\\nshall tread in the sticky warm blood, break the lock, steal and tremble;\\r\\nhide, all spattered in the blood... with the axe.... Good God, can it\\r\\nbe?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was shaking like a leaf as he said this.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But why am I going on like this?” he continued, sitting up again, as it\\r\\nwere in profound amazement. “I knew that I could never bring myself\\r\\nto it, so what have I been torturing myself for till now? Yesterday,\\r\\nyesterday, when I went to make that... _experiment_, yesterday I\\r\\nrealised completely that I could never bear to do it.... Why am I going\\r\\nover it again, then? Why am I hesitating? As I came down the stairs\\r\\nyesterday, I said myself that it was base, loathsome, vile, vile... the\\r\\nvery thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t do it! Granted, granted that there is\\r\\nno flaw in all that reasoning, that all that I have concluded this last\\r\\nmonth is clear as day, true as arithmetic.... My God! Anyway I couldn’t\\r\\nbring myself to it! I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t do it! Why, why then am\\r\\nI still...?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose to his feet, looked round in wonder as though surprised at\\r\\nfinding himself in this place, and went towards the bridge. He was pale,\\r\\nhis eyes glowed, he was exhausted in every limb, but he seemed suddenly\\r\\nto breathe more easily. He felt he had cast off that fearful burden that\\r\\nhad so long been weighing upon him, and all at once there was a sense\\r\\nof relief and peace in his soul. “Lord,” he prayed, “show me my path--I\\r\\nrenounce that accursed... dream of mine.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCrossing the bridge, he gazed quietly and calmly at the Neva, at the\\r\\nglowing red sun setting in the glowing sky. In spite of his weakness he\\r\\nwas not conscious of fatigue. It was as though an abscess that had been\\r\\nforming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken. Freedom,\\r\\nfreedom! He was free from that spell, that sorcery, that obsession!\\r\\n\\r\\nLater on, when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during\\r\\nthose days, minute by minute, point by point, he was superstitiously\\r\\nimpressed by one circumstance, which, though in itself not very\\r\\nexceptional, always seemed to him afterwards the predestined\\r\\nturning-point of his fate. He could never understand and explain to\\r\\nhimself why, when he was tired and worn out, when it would have been\\r\\nmore convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way,\\r\\nhe had returned by the Hay Market where he had no need to go. It was\\r\\nobviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way, though not much so. It\\r\\nis true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without\\r\\nnoticing what streets he passed through. But why, he was always asking\\r\\nhimself, why had such an important, such a decisive and at the same time\\r\\nsuch an absolutely chance meeting happened in the Hay Market (where he\\r\\nhad moreover no reason to go) at the very hour, the very minute of his\\r\\nlife when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances\\r\\nin which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive\\r\\ninfluence on his whole destiny? As though it had been lying in wait for\\r\\nhim on purpose!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was about nine o’clock when he crossed the Hay Market. At the tables\\r\\nand the barrows, at the booths and the shops, all the market people were\\r\\nclosing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their\\r\\nwares and, like their customers, were going home. Rag pickers and\\r\\ncostermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty\\r\\nand stinking courtyards of the Hay Market. Raskolnikov particularly\\r\\nliked this place and the neighbouring alleys, when he wandered aimlessly\\r\\nin the streets. Here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention,\\r\\nand one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people. At\\r\\nthe corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out\\r\\nwith tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc. They, too, had got up to\\r\\ngo home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had just\\r\\ncome up to them. This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or, as everyone\\r\\ncalled her, Lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Alyona\\r\\nIvanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his\\r\\nwatch and make his _experiment_.... He already knew all about Lizaveta\\r\\nand she knew him a little too. She was a single woman of about\\r\\nthirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic. She was\\r\\na complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister, who\\r\\nmade her work day and night, and even beat her. She was standing with\\r\\na bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly and\\r\\ndoubtfully. They were talking of something with special warmth. The\\r\\nmoment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange\\r\\nsensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothing\\r\\nastonishing about this meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You could make up your mind for yourself, Lizaveta Ivanovna,” the\\r\\nhuckster was saying aloud. “Come round to-morrow about seven. They will\\r\\nbe here too.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To-morrow?” said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as though unable to\\r\\nmake up her mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Upon my word, what a fright you are in of Alyona Ivanovna,” gabbled\\r\\nthe huckster’s wife, a lively little woman. “I look at you, you are like\\r\\nsome little babe. And she is not your own sister either--nothing but a\\r\\nstep-sister and what a hand she keeps over you!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But this time don’t say a word to Alyona Ivanovna,” her husband\\r\\ninterrupted; “that’s my advice, but come round to us without asking.\\r\\nIt will be worth your while. Later on your sister herself may have a\\r\\nnotion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Am I to come?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“About seven o’clock to-morrow. And they will be here. You will be able\\r\\nto decide for yourself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And we’ll have a cup of tea,” added his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right, I’ll come,” said Lizaveta, still pondering, and she began\\r\\nslowly moving away.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov had just passed and heard no more. He passed softly,\\r\\nunnoticed, trying not to miss a word. His first amazement was followed\\r\\nby a thrill of horror, like a shiver running down his spine. He had\\r\\nlearnt, he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt, that the next day at\\r\\nseven o’clock Lizaveta, the old woman’s sister and only companion, would\\r\\nbe away from home and that therefore at seven o’clock precisely the old\\r\\nwoman _would be left alone_.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was only a few steps from his lodging. He went in like a man\\r\\ncondemned to death. He thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking;\\r\\nbut he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom\\r\\nof thought, no will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably\\r\\ndecided.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly, if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity, he\\r\\ncould not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan\\r\\nthan that which had just presented itself. In any case, it would have\\r\\nbeen difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty, with\\r\\ngreater exactness and less risk, and without dangerous inquiries and\\r\\ninvestigations, that next day at a certain time an old woman, on whose\\r\\nlife an attempt was contemplated, would be at home and entirely alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\nLater on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his\\r\\nwife had invited Lizaveta. It was a very ordinary matter and there was\\r\\nnothing exceptional about it. A family who had come to the town and been\\r\\nreduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes, all\\r\\nwomen’s things. As the things would have fetched little in the market,\\r\\nthey were looking for a dealer. This was Lizaveta’s business. She\\r\\nundertook such jobs and was frequently employed, as she was very honest\\r\\nand always fixed a fair price and stuck to it. She spoke as a rule\\r\\nlittle and, as we have said already, she was very submissive and timid.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late. The traces of\\r\\nsuperstition remained in him long after, and were almost ineradicable.\\r\\nAnd in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something\\r\\nstrange and mysterious, as it were, the presence of some peculiar\\r\\ninfluences and coincidences. In the previous winter a student he knew\\r\\ncalled Pokorev, who had left for Harkov, had chanced in conversation to\\r\\ngive him the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case he\\r\\nmight want to pawn anything. For a long while he did not go to her, for\\r\\nhe had lessons and managed to get along somehow. Six weeks ago he had\\r\\nremembered the address; he had two articles that could be pawned: his\\r\\nfather’s old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones,\\r\\na present from his sister at parting. He decided to take the ring. When\\r\\nhe found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her\\r\\nat the first glance, though he knew nothing special about her. He got\\r\\ntwo roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way\\r\\nhome. He asked for tea, sat down and sank into deep thought. A strange\\r\\nidea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, very\\r\\nmuch absorbed him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student, whom he\\r\\ndid not know and had never seen, and with him a young officer. They had\\r\\nplayed a game of billiards and began drinking tea. All at once he heard\\r\\nthe student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and\\r\\ngive him her address. This of itself seemed strange to Raskolnikov; he\\r\\nhad just come from her and here at once he heard her name. Of course\\r\\nit was a chance, but he could not shake off a very extraordinary\\r\\nimpression, and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him;\\r\\nthe student began telling his friend various details about Alyona\\r\\nIvanovna.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She is first-rate,” he said. “You can always get money from her. She is\\r\\nas rich as a Jew, she can give you five thousand roubles at a time and\\r\\nshe is not above taking a pledge for a rouble. Lots of our fellows have\\r\\nhad dealings with her. But she is an awful old harpy....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was, how if you\\r\\nwere only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost; how she\\r\\ngave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven\\r\\npercent a month on it and so on. The student chattered on, saying\\r\\nthat she had a sister Lizaveta, whom the wretched little creature was\\r\\ncontinually beating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child,\\r\\nthough Lizaveta was at least six feet high.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s a phenomenon for you,” cried the student and he laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey began talking about Lizaveta. The student spoke about her with a\\r\\npeculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened\\r\\nwith great interest and asked him to send Lizaveta to do some mending\\r\\nfor him. Raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about\\r\\nher. Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister,\\r\\nbeing the child of a different mother. She was thirty-five. She worked\\r\\nday and night for her sister, and besides doing the cooking and the\\r\\nwashing, she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister\\r\\nall she earned. She did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind\\r\\nwithout her sister’s permission. The old woman had already made her\\r\\nwill, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this will she would not get a\\r\\nfarthing; nothing but the movables, chairs and so on; all the money was\\r\\nleft to a monastery in the province of N----, that prayers might be\\r\\nsaid for her in perpetuity. Lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister,\\r\\nunmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, remarkably tall with long\\r\\nfeet that looked as if they were bent outwards. She always wore battered\\r\\ngoatskin shoes, and was clean in her person. What the student expressed\\r\\nmost surprise and amusement about was the fact that Lizaveta was\\r\\ncontinually with child.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you say she is hideous?” observed the officer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, she is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up, but\\r\\nyou know she is not at all hideous. She has such a good-natured face\\r\\nand eyes. Strikingly so. And the proof of it is that lots of people are\\r\\nattracted by her. She is such a soft, gentle creature, ready to put up\\r\\nwith anything, always willing, willing to do anything. And her smile is\\r\\nreally very sweet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You seem to find her attractive yourself,” laughed the officer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“From her queerness. No, I’ll tell you what. I could kill that damned\\r\\nold woman and make off with her money, I assure you, without the\\r\\nfaintest conscience-prick,” the student added with warmth. The officer\\r\\nlaughed again while Raskolnikov shuddered. How strange it was!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen, I want to ask you a serious question,” the student said hotly.\\r\\n“I was joking of course, but look here; on one side we have a stupid,\\r\\nsenseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, horrid old woman, not simply\\r\\nuseless but doing actual mischief, who has not an idea what she is\\r\\nliving for herself, and who will die in a day or two in any case. You\\r\\nunderstand? You understand?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes, I understand,” answered the officer, watching his excited\\r\\ncompanion attentively.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, listen then. On the other side, fresh young lives thrown away for\\r\\nwant of help and by thousands, on every side! A hundred thousand good\\r\\ndeeds could be done and helped, on that old woman’s money which will be\\r\\nburied in a monastery! Hundreds, thousands perhaps, might be set on the\\r\\nright path; dozens of families saved from destitution, from ruin, from\\r\\nvice, from the Lock hospitals--and all with her money. Kill her, take\\r\\nher money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of\\r\\nhumanity and the good of all. What do you think, would not one tiny\\r\\ncrime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds? For one life thousands\\r\\nwould be saved from corruption and decay. One death, and a hundred lives\\r\\nin exchange--it’s simple arithmetic! Besides, what value has the life of\\r\\nthat sickly, stupid, ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence!\\r\\nNo more than the life of a louse, of a black-beetle, less in fact\\r\\nbecause the old woman is doing harm. She is wearing out the lives of\\r\\nothers; the other day she bit Lizaveta’s finger out of spite; it almost\\r\\nhad to be amputated.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course she does not deserve to live,” remarked the officer, “but\\r\\nthere it is, it’s nature.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, well, brother, but we have to correct and direct nature, and, but\\r\\nfor that, we should drown in an ocean of prejudice. But for that,\\r\\nthere would never have been a single great man. They talk of\\r\\nduty, conscience--I don’t want to say anything against duty and\\r\\nconscience;--but the point is, what do we mean by them? Stay, I have\\r\\nanother question to ask you. Listen!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, you stay, I’ll ask you a question. Listen!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are talking and speechifying away, but tell me, would you kill the\\r\\nold woman _yourself_?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course not! I was only arguing the justice of it.... It’s nothing to\\r\\ndo with me....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I think, if you would not do it yourself, there’s no justice about\\r\\nit.... Let us have another game.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov was violently agitated. Of course, it was all ordinary\\r\\nyouthful talk and thought, such as he had often heard before in\\r\\ndifferent forms and on different themes. But why had he happened to hear\\r\\nsuch a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain\\r\\nwas just conceiving... _the very same ideas_? And why, just at the\\r\\nmoment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the old\\r\\nwoman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her? This\\r\\ncoincidence always seemed strange to him. This trivial talk in a tavern\\r\\nhad an immense influence on him in his later action; as though there had\\r\\nreally been in it something preordained, some guiding hint....\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\nOn returning from the Hay Market he flung himself on the sofa and sat\\r\\nfor a whole hour without stirring. Meanwhile it got dark; he had no\\r\\ncandle and, indeed, it did not occur to him to light up. He could never\\r\\nrecollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time. At\\r\\nlast he was conscious of his former fever and shivering, and he realised\\r\\nwith relief that he could lie down on the sofa. Soon heavy, leaden sleep\\r\\ncame over him, as it were crushing him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming. Nastasya,\\r\\ncoming into his room at ten o’clock the next morning, had difficulty\\r\\nin rousing him. She brought him in tea and bread. The tea was again the\\r\\nsecond brew and again in her own tea-pot.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My goodness, how he sleeps!” she cried indignantly. “And he is always\\r\\nasleep.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got up with an effort. His head ached, he stood up, took a turn in\\r\\nhis garret and sank back on the sofa again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Going to sleep again,” cried Nastasya. “Are you ill, eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you want some tea?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Afterwards,” he said with an effort, closing his eyes again and turning\\r\\nto the wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasya stood over him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps he really is ill,” she said, turned and went out. She came in\\r\\nagain at two o’clock with soup. He was lying as before. The tea stood\\r\\nuntouched. Nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfully\\r\\nrousing him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why are you lying like a log?” she shouted, looking at him with\\r\\nrepulsion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got up, and sat down again, but said nothing and stared at the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you ill or not?” asked Nastasya and again received no answer.\\r\\n“You’d better go out and get a breath of air,” she said after a pause.\\r\\n“Will you eat it or not?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Afterwards,” he said weakly. “You can go.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he motioned her out.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe remained a little longer, looked at him with compassion and went\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few minutes afterwards, he raised his eyes and looked for a long while\\r\\nat the tea and the soup. Then he took the bread, took up a spoon and\\r\\nbegan to eat.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were\\r\\nmechanically. His head ached less. After his meal he stretched himself\\r\\non the sofa again, but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring,\\r\\nwith his face in the pillow. He was haunted by day-dreams and such\\r\\nstrange day-dreams; in one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he was\\r\\nin Africa, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis. The caravan was resting,\\r\\nthe camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood all around in a\\r\\ncomplete circle; all the party were at dinner. But he was drinking water\\r\\nfrom a spring which flowed gurgling close by. And it was so cool, it was\\r\\nwonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-coloured\\r\\nstones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like\\r\\ngold.... Suddenly he heard a clock strike. He started, roused himself,\\r\\nraised his head, looked out of the window, and seeing how late it was,\\r\\nsuddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the\\r\\nsofa. He crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and began\\r\\nlistening on the staircase. His heart beat terribly. But all was quiet\\r\\non the stairs as if everyone was asleep.... It seemed to him strange and\\r\\nmonstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the\\r\\nprevious day and had done nothing, had prepared nothing yet.... And\\r\\nmeanwhile perhaps it had struck six. And his drowsiness and stupefaction\\r\\nwere followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it were distracted\\r\\nhaste. But the preparations to be made were few. He concentrated all his\\r\\nenergies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his heart\\r\\nkept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe. First he had\\r\\nto make a noose and sew it into his overcoat--a work of a moment. He\\r\\nrummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away\\r\\nunder it, a worn out, old unwashed shirt. From its rags he tore a long\\r\\nstrip, a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long. He folded\\r\\nthis strip in two, took off his wide, strong summer overcoat of some\\r\\nstout cotton material (his only outer garment) and began sewing the two\\r\\nends of the rag on the inside, under the left armhole. His hands shook\\r\\nas he sewed, but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside\\r\\nwhen he put the coat on again. The needle and thread he had got ready\\r\\nlong before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper. As for the\\r\\nnoose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the noose was intended\\r\\nfor the axe. It was impossible for him to carry the axe through the\\r\\nstreet in his hands. And if hidden under his coat he would still have\\r\\nhad to support it with his hand, which would have been noticeable. Now\\r\\nhe had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang\\r\\nquietly under his arm on the inside. Putting his hand in his coat\\r\\npocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, so that it did\\r\\nnot swing; and as the coat was very full, a regular sack in fact, it\\r\\ncould not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the\\r\\nhand that was in the pocket. This noose, too, he had designed a\\r\\nfortnight before.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a little opening\\r\\nbetween his sofa and the floor, fumbled in the left corner and drew out\\r\\nthe _pledge_, which he had got ready long before and hidden there. This\\r\\npledge was, however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and\\r\\nthickness of a silver cigarette case. He picked up this piece of wood\\r\\nin one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of\\r\\na workshop. Afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece\\r\\nof iron, which he had also picked up at the same time in the street.\\r\\nPutting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood,\\r\\nhe fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread round\\r\\nthem; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and\\r\\ntied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it. This\\r\\nwas in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time, while\\r\\nshe was trying to undo the knot, and so to gain a moment. The iron strip\\r\\nwas added to give weight, so that the woman might not guess the first\\r\\nminute that the “thing” was made of wood. All this had been stored by\\r\\nhim beforehand under the sofa. He had only just got the pledge out when\\r\\nhe heard someone suddenly about in the yard.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It struck six long ago.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Long ago! My God!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rushed to the door, listened, caught up his hat and began to descend\\r\\nhis thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, like a cat. He had still the\\r\\nmost important thing to do--to steal the axe from the kitchen. That the\\r\\ndeed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago. He had also a\\r\\npocket pruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife and still less\\r\\non his own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe. We may note in\\r\\npassing, one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by\\r\\nhim in the matter; they had one strange characteristic: the more final\\r\\nthey were, the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in\\r\\nhis eyes. In spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never for\\r\\na single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his\\r\\nplans.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to the least point\\r\\ncould have been considered and finally settled, and no uncertainty of\\r\\nany kind had remained, he would, it seems, have renounced it all\\r\\nas something absurd, monstrous and impossible. But a whole mass of\\r\\nunsettled points and uncertainties remained. As for getting the axe,\\r\\nthat trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could be easier.\\r\\nNastasya was continually out of the house, especially in the evenings;\\r\\nshe would run in to the neighbours or to a shop, and always left the\\r\\ndoor ajar. It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her\\r\\nabout. And so, when the time came, he would only have to go quietly into\\r\\nthe kitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when everything\\r\\nwas over) go in and put it back again. But these were doubtful points.\\r\\nSupposing he returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasya had\\r\\ncome back and was on the spot. He would of course have to go by and wait\\r\\ntill she went out again. But supposing she were in the meantime to miss\\r\\nthe axe, look for it, make an outcry--that would mean suspicion or at\\r\\nleast grounds for suspicion.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider, and\\r\\nindeed he had no time. He was thinking of the chief point, and put off\\r\\ntrifling details, until _he could believe in it all_. But that seemed\\r\\nutterly unattainable. So it seemed to himself at least. He could not\\r\\nimagine, for instance, that he would sometime leave off thinking, get\\r\\nup and simply go there.... Even his late experiment (i.e. his visit with\\r\\nthe object of a final survey of the place) was simply an attempt at\\r\\nan experiment, far from being the real thing, as though one should say\\r\\n“come, let us go and try it--why dream about it!”--and at once he\\r\\nhad broken down and had run away cursing, in a frenzy with himself.\\r\\nMeanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that his\\r\\nanalysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, and he\\r\\ncould not find rational objections in himself. But in the last resort\\r\\nhe simply ceased to believe in himself, and doggedly, slavishly sought\\r\\narguments in all directions, fumbling for them, as though someone were\\r\\nforcing and drawing him to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first--long before indeed--he had been much occupied with one\\r\\nquestion; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily\\r\\ndetected, and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces? He\\r\\nhad come gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and in his\\r\\nopinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility\\r\\nof concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself. Almost every\\r\\ncriminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a\\r\\nchildish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when prudence\\r\\nand caution are most essential. It was his conviction that this eclipse\\r\\nof reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease,\\r\\ndeveloped gradually and reached its highest point just before the\\r\\nperpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment\\r\\nof the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the\\r\\nindividual case, and then passed off like any other disease. The\\r\\nquestion whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the\\r\\ncrime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of\\r\\nthe nature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he reached these conclusions, he decided that in his own case there\\r\\ncould not be such a morbid reaction, that his reason and will would\\r\\nremain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design, for the\\r\\nsimple reason that his design was “not a crime....” We will omit all the\\r\\nprocess by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion; we have\\r\\nrun too far ahead already.... We may add only that the practical, purely\\r\\nmaterial difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his\\r\\nmind. “One has but to keep all one’s will-power and reason to deal\\r\\nwith them, and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has\\r\\nfamiliarised oneself with the minutest details of the business....” But\\r\\nthis preparation had never been begun. His final decisions were what he\\r\\ncame to trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass quite\\r\\ndifferently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before he had even\\r\\nleft the staircase. When he reached the landlady’s kitchen, the door\\r\\nof which was open as usual, he glanced cautiously in to see whether, in\\r\\nNastasya’s absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whether\\r\\nthe door to her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out when\\r\\nhe went in for the axe. But what was his amazement when he suddenly\\r\\nsaw that Nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen, but was occupied\\r\\nthere, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line. Seeing\\r\\nhim, she left off hanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at him\\r\\nall the time he was passing. He turned away his eyes, and walked past as\\r\\nthough he noticed nothing. But it was the end of everything; he had not\\r\\nthe axe! He was overwhelmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What made me think,” he reflected, as he went under the gateway, “what\\r\\nmade me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment!\\r\\nWhy, why, why did I assume this so certainly?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was crushed and even humiliated. He could have laughed at himself in\\r\\nhis anger.... A dull animal rage boiled within him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood hesitating in the gateway. To go into the street, to go a walk\\r\\nfor appearance’ sake was revolting; to go back to his room, even more\\r\\nrevolting. “And what a chance I have lost for ever!” he muttered,\\r\\nstanding aimlessly in the gateway, just opposite the porter’s little\\r\\ndark room, which was also open. Suddenly he started. From the porter’s\\r\\nroom, two paces away from him, something shining under the bench to the\\r\\nright caught his eye.... He looked about him--nobody. He approached the\\r\\nroom on tiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called\\r\\nthe porter. “Yes, not at home! Somewhere near though, in the yard, for\\r\\nthe door is wide open.” He dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulled\\r\\nit out from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks of wood;\\r\\nat once, before going out, he made it fast in the noose, he thrust both\\r\\nhands into his pockets and went out of the room; no one had noticed him!\\r\\n“When reason fails, the devil helps!” he thought with a strange grin.\\r\\nThis chance raised his spirits extraordinarily.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to avoid awakening\\r\\nsuspicion. He scarcely looked at the passers-by, tried to escape looking\\r\\nat their faces at all, and to be as little noticeable as possible.\\r\\nSuddenly he thought of his hat. “Good heavens! I had the money the day\\r\\nbefore yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead!” A curse rose\\r\\nfrom the bottom of his soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw by a clock on\\r\\nthe wall that it was ten minutes past seven. He had to make haste and at\\r\\nthe same time to go someway round, so as to approach the house from the\\r\\nother side....\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, he had sometimes\\r\\nthought that he would be very much afraid. But he was not very much\\r\\nafraid now, was not afraid at all, indeed. His mind was even occupied\\r\\nby irrelevant matters, but by nothing for long. As he passed the Yusupov\\r\\ngarden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great\\r\\nfountains, and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all\\r\\nthe squares. By degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer\\r\\ngarden were extended to the field of Mars, and perhaps joined to the\\r\\ngarden of the Mihailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and a\\r\\ngreat benefit to the town. Then he was interested by the question why\\r\\nin all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in some\\r\\npeculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there\\r\\nare no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and all\\r\\nsorts of nastiness. Then his own walks through the Hay Market came back\\r\\nto his mind, and for a moment he waked up to reality. “What nonsense!”\\r\\n he thought, “better think of nothing at all!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that\\r\\nmeets them on the way,” flashed through his mind, but simply flashed,\\r\\nlike lightning; he made haste to dismiss this thought.... And by now\\r\\nhe was near; here was the house, here was the gate. Suddenly a clock\\r\\nsomewhere struck once. “What! can it be half-past seven? Impossible, it\\r\\nmust be fast!”\\r\\n\\r\\nLuckily for him, everything went well again at the gates. At that very\\r\\nmoment, as though expressly for his benefit, a huge waggon of hay had\\r\\njust driven in at the gate, completely screening him as he passed under\\r\\nthe gateway, and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into\\r\\nthe yard, before he had slipped in a flash to the right. On the other\\r\\nside of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling; but no one\\r\\nnoticed him and no one met him. Many windows looking into that huge\\r\\nquadrangular yard were open at that moment, but he did not raise his\\r\\nhead--he had not the strength to. The staircase leading to the old\\r\\nwoman’s room was close by, just on the right of the gateway. He was\\r\\nalready on the stairs....\\r\\n\\r\\nDrawing a breath, pressing his hand against his throbbing heart, and\\r\\nonce more feeling for the axe and setting it straight, he began softly\\r\\nand cautiously ascending the stairs, listening every minute. But the\\r\\nstairs, too, were quite deserted; all the doors were shut; he met no\\r\\none. One flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were\\r\\nat work in it, but they did not glance at him. He stood still, thought\\r\\na minute and went on. “Of course it would be better if they had not been\\r\\nhere, but... it’s two storeys above them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there was the fourth storey, here was the door, here was the\\r\\nflat opposite, the empty one. The flat underneath the old woman’s was\\r\\napparently empty also; the visiting card nailed on the door had been\\r\\ntorn off--they had gone away!... He was out of breath. For one instant\\r\\nthe thought floated through his mind “Shall I go back?” But he made no\\r\\nanswer and began listening at the old woman’s door, a dead silence. Then\\r\\nhe listened again on the staircase, listened long and intently...\\r\\nthen looked about him for the last time, pulled himself together, drew\\r\\nhimself up, and once more tried the axe in the noose. “Am I very pale?”\\r\\n he wondered. “Am I not evidently agitated? She is mistrustful.... Had I\\r\\nbetter wait a little longer... till my heart leaves off thumping?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut his heart did not leave off. On the contrary, as though to spite\\r\\nhim, it throbbed more and more violently. He could stand it no longer,\\r\\nhe slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang. Half a minute later he\\r\\nrang again, more loudly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo answer. To go on ringing was useless and out of place. The old woman\\r\\nwas, of course, at home, but she was suspicious and alone. He had some\\r\\nknowledge of her habits... and once more he put his ear to the door.\\r\\nEither his senses were peculiarly keen (which it is difficult to\\r\\nsuppose), or the sound was really very distinct. Anyway, he suddenly\\r\\nheard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the\\r\\nrustle of a skirt at the very door. Someone was standing stealthily\\r\\nclose to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly\\r\\nlistening within, and seemed to have her ear to the door.... He moved\\r\\na little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have\\r\\nthe appearance of hiding, then rang a third time, but quietly, soberly,\\r\\nand without impatience, Recalling it afterwards, that moment stood out\\r\\nin his mind vividly, distinctly, for ever; he could not make out how he\\r\\nhad had such cunning, for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and\\r\\nhe was almost unconscious of his body.... An instant later he heard the\\r\\nlatch unfastened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door was as before opened a tiny crack, and again two sharp and\\r\\nsuspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness. Then Raskolnikov lost\\r\\nhis head and nearly made a great mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nFearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone, and not\\r\\nhoping that the sight of him would disarm her suspicions, he took\\r\\nhold of the door and drew it towards him to prevent the old woman from\\r\\nattempting to shut it again. Seeing this she did not pull the door back,\\r\\nbut she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out with\\r\\nit on to the stairs. Seeing that she was standing in the doorway not\\r\\nallowing him to pass, he advanced straight upon her. She stepped back\\r\\nin alarm, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak and stared\\r\\nwith open eyes at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good evening, Alyona Ivanovna,” he began, trying to speak easily, but\\r\\nhis voice would not obey him, it broke and shook. “I have come... I have\\r\\nbrought something... but we’d better come in... to the light....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd leaving her, he passed straight into the room uninvited. The old\\r\\nwoman ran after him; her tongue was unloosed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens! What it is? Who is it? What do you want?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, Alyona Ivanovna, you know me... Raskolnikov... here, I brought you\\r\\nthe pledge I promised the other day...” And he held out the pledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge, but at once stared in\\r\\nthe eyes of her uninvited visitor. She looked intently, maliciously and\\r\\nmistrustfully. A minute passed; he even fancied something like a sneer\\r\\nin her eyes, as though she had already guessed everything. He felt that\\r\\nhe was losing his head, that he was almost frightened, so frightened\\r\\nthat if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half\\r\\nminute, he thought he would have run away from her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why do you look at me as though you did not know me?” he said suddenly,\\r\\nalso with malice. “Take it if you like, if not I’ll go elsewhere, I am\\r\\nin a hurry.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had not even thought of saying this, but it was suddenly said of\\r\\nitself. The old woman recovered herself, and her visitor’s resolute tone\\r\\nevidently restored her confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But why, my good sir, all of a minute.... What is it?” she asked,\\r\\nlooking at the pledge.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The silver cigarette case; I spoke of it last time, you know.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe held out her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But how pale you are, to be sure... and your hands are trembling too?\\r\\nHave you been bathing, or what?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fever,” he answered abruptly. “You can’t help getting pale... if you’ve\\r\\nnothing to eat,” he added, with difficulty articulating the words.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis strength was failing him again. But his answer sounded like the\\r\\ntruth; the old woman took the pledge.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?” she asked once more, scanning Raskolnikov intently, and\\r\\nweighing the pledge in her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A thing... cigarette case.... Silver.... Look at it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It does not seem somehow like silver.... How he has wrapped it up!”\\r\\n\\r\\nTrying to untie the string and turning to the window, to the light (all\\r\\nher windows were shut, in spite of the stifling heat), she left\\r\\nhim altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him. He\\r\\nunbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose, but did not yet\\r\\ntake it out altogether, simply holding it in his right hand under the\\r\\ncoat. His hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment growing\\r\\nmore numb and more wooden. He was afraid he would let the axe slip and\\r\\nfall.... A sudden giddiness came over him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what has he tied it up like this for?” the old woman cried with\\r\\nvexation and moved towards him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had not a minute more to lose. He pulled the axe quite out, swung\\r\\nit with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost without\\r\\neffort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head. He\\r\\nseemed not to use his own strength in this. But as soon as he had once\\r\\nbrought the axe down, his strength returned to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman was as always bareheaded. Her thin, light hair, streaked\\r\\nwith grey, thickly smeared with grease, was plaited in a rat’s tail and\\r\\nfastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck.\\r\\nAs she was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her skull. She\\r\\ncried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the\\r\\nfloor, raising her hands to her head. In one hand she still held “the\\r\\npledge.” Then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side\\r\\nand on the same spot. The blood gushed as from an overturned glass, the\\r\\nbody fell back. He stepped back, let it fall, and at once bent over her\\r\\nface; she was dead. Her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets,\\r\\nthe brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her\\r\\npocket (trying to avoid the streaming body)--the same right-hand pocket\\r\\nfrom which she had taken the key on his last visit. He was in full\\r\\npossession of his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but his\\r\\nhands were still trembling. He remembered afterwards that he had been\\r\\nparticularly collected and careful, trying all the time not to get\\r\\nsmeared with blood.... He pulled out the keys at once, they were all,\\r\\nas before, in one bunch on a steel ring. He ran at once into the bedroom\\r\\nwith them. It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images.\\r\\nAgainst the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and covered with\\r\\na silk patchwork wadded quilt. Against a third wall was a chest of\\r\\ndrawers. Strange to say, so soon as he began to fit the keys into the\\r\\nchest, so soon as he heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passed\\r\\nover him. He suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go\\r\\naway. But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back.\\r\\nHe positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying idea\\r\\noccurred to his mind. He suddenly fancied that the old woman might be\\r\\nstill alive and might recover her senses. Leaving the keys in the chest,\\r\\nhe ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once more\\r\\nover the old woman, but did not bring it down. There was no doubt that\\r\\nshe was dead. Bending down and examining her again more closely, he saw\\r\\nclearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side. He\\r\\nwas about to feel it with his finger, but drew back his hand and indeed\\r\\nit was evident without that. Meanwhile there was a perfect pool of\\r\\nblood. All at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it, but\\r\\nthe string was strong and did not snap and besides, it was soaked\\r\\nwith blood. He tried to pull it out from the front of the dress, but\\r\\nsomething held it and prevented its coming. In his impatience he raised\\r\\nthe axe again to cut the string from above on the body, but did not\\r\\ndare, and with difficulty, smearing his hand and the axe in the blood,\\r\\nafter two minutes’ hurried effort, he cut the string and took it off\\r\\nwithout touching the body with the axe; he was not mistaken--it was a\\r\\npurse. On the string were two crosses, one of Cyprus wood and one of\\r\\ncopper, and an image in silver filigree, and with them a small greasy\\r\\nchamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring. The purse was stuffed\\r\\nvery full; Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it,\\r\\nflung the crosses on the old woman’s body and rushed back into the\\r\\nbedroom, this time taking the axe with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was in terrible haste, he snatched the keys, and began trying them\\r\\nagain. But he was unsuccessful. They would not fit in the locks. It\\r\\nwas not so much that his hands were shaking, but that he kept making\\r\\nmistakes; though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one\\r\\nand would not fit, still he tried to put it in. Suddenly he remembered\\r\\nand realised that the big key with the deep notches, which was hanging\\r\\nthere with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of\\r\\ndrawers (on his last visit this had struck him), but to some strong box,\\r\\nand that everything perhaps was hidden in that box. He left the chest\\r\\nof drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, knowing that old\\r\\nwomen usually keep boxes under their beds. And so it was; there was a\\r\\ngood-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with an arched\\r\\nlid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails. The notched\\r\\nkey fitted at once and unlocked it. At the top, under a white sheet, was\\r\\na coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress,\\r\\nthen a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but\\r\\nclothes. The first thing he did was to wipe his blood-stained hands on\\r\\nthe red brocade. “It’s red, and on red blood will be less noticeable,”\\r\\n the thought passed through his mind; then he suddenly came to himself.\\r\\n“Good God, am I going out of my senses?” he thought with terror.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from\\r\\nunder the fur coat. He made haste to turn them all over. There turned\\r\\nout to be various articles made of gold among the clothes--probably\\r\\nall pledges, unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed--bracelets, chains,\\r\\near-rings, pins and such things. Some were in cases, others simply\\r\\nwrapped in newspaper, carefully and exactly folded, and tied round with\\r\\ntape. Without any delay, he began filling up the pockets of his trousers\\r\\nand overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases; but he\\r\\nhad not time to take many....\\r\\n\\r\\nHe suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay. He stopped\\r\\nshort and was still as death. But all was quiet, so it must have been\\r\\nhis fancy. All at once he heard distinctly a faint cry, as though\\r\\nsomeone had uttered a low broken moan. Then again dead silence for\\r\\na minute or two. He sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited\\r\\nholding his breath. Suddenly he jumped up, seized the axe and ran out of\\r\\nthe bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms.\\r\\nShe was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a sheet\\r\\nand seeming not to have the strength to cry out. Seeing him run out\\r\\nof the bedroom, she began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, a\\r\\nshudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, but\\r\\nstill did not scream. She began slowly backing away from him into the\\r\\ncorner, staring intently, persistently at him, but still uttered no\\r\\nsound, as though she could not get breath to scream. He rushed at her\\r\\nwith the axe; her mouth twitched piteously, as one sees babies’ mouths,\\r\\nwhen they begin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens them\\r\\nand are on the point of screaming. And this hapless Lizaveta was so\\r\\nsimple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not\\r\\neven raise a hand to guard her face, though that was the most necessary\\r\\nand natural action at the moment, for the axe was raised over her face.\\r\\nShe only put up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly holding\\r\\nit out before her as though motioning him away. The axe fell with the\\r\\nsharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the\\r\\nhead. She fell heavily at once. Raskolnikov completely lost his head,\\r\\nsnatching up her bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry.\\r\\n\\r\\nFear gained more and more mastery over him, especially after this\\r\\nsecond, quite unexpected murder. He longed to run away from the place\\r\\nas fast as possible. And if at that moment he had been capable of seeing\\r\\nand reasoning more correctly, if he had been able to realise all the\\r\\ndifficulties of his position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and the\\r\\nabsurdity of it, if he could have understood how many obstacles and,\\r\\nperhaps, crimes he had still to overcome or to commit, to get out of\\r\\nthat place and to make his way home, it is very possible that he would\\r\\nhave flung up everything, and would have gone to give himself up, and\\r\\nnot from fear, but from simple horror and loathing of what he had\\r\\ndone. The feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew\\r\\nstronger every minute. He would not now have gone to the box or even\\r\\ninto the room for anything in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun by degrees to take\\r\\npossession of him; at moments he forgot himself, or rather, forgot what\\r\\nwas of importance, and caught at trifles. Glancing, however, into the\\r\\nkitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he bethought\\r\\nhim of washing his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky with blood.\\r\\nHe dropped the axe with the blade in the water, snatched a piece of soap\\r\\nthat lay in a broken saucer on the window, and began washing his hands\\r\\nin the bucket. When they were clean, he took out the axe, washed the\\r\\nblade and spent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood where\\r\\nthere were spots of blood rubbing them with soap. Then he wiped it all\\r\\nwith some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and\\r\\nthen he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window.\\r\\nThere was no trace left on it, only the wood was still damp. He\\r\\ncarefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat. Then as far as was\\r\\npossible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over his overcoat,\\r\\nhis trousers and his boots. At the first glance there seemed to be\\r\\nnothing but stains on the boots. He wetted the rag and rubbed the boots.\\r\\nBut he knew he was not looking thoroughly, that there might be something\\r\\nquite noticeable that he was overlooking. He stood in the middle of the\\r\\nroom, lost in thought. Dark agonising ideas rose in his mind--the idea\\r\\nthat he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning,\\r\\nof protecting himself, that he ought perhaps to be doing something\\r\\nutterly different from what he was now doing. “Good God!” he muttered “I\\r\\nmust fly, fly,” and he rushed into the entry. But here a shock of terror\\r\\nawaited him such as he had never known before.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the door, the outer\\r\\ndoor from the stairs, at which he had not long before waited and rung,\\r\\nwas standing unfastened and at least six inches open. No lock, no bolt,\\r\\nall the time, all that time! The old woman had not shut it after him\\r\\nperhaps as a precaution. But, good God! Why, he had seen Lizaveta\\r\\nafterwards! And how could he, how could he have failed to reflect that\\r\\nshe must have come in somehow! She could not have come through the wall!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dashed to the door and fastened the latch.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But no, the wrong thing again! I must get away, get away....”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe unfastened the latch, opened the door and began listening on the\\r\\nstaircase.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe listened a long time. Somewhere far away, it might be in the gateway,\\r\\ntwo voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, quarrelling and scolding.\\r\\n“What are they about?” He waited patiently. At last all was still, as\\r\\nthough suddenly cut off; they had separated. He was meaning to go out,\\r\\nbut suddenly, on the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someone\\r\\nbegan going downstairs humming a tune. “How is it they all make such\\r\\na noise?” flashed through his mind. Once more he closed the door and\\r\\nwaited. At last all was still, not a soul stirring. He was just taking a\\r\\nstep towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the stairs, but\\r\\nhe remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he\\r\\nbegan for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming _there_,\\r\\nto the fourth floor, to the old woman. Why? Were the sounds somehow\\r\\npeculiar, significant? The steps were heavy, even and unhurried. Now\\r\\n_he_ had passed the first floor, now he was mounting higher, it was\\r\\ngrowing more and more distinct! He could hear his heavy breathing. And\\r\\nnow the third storey had been reached. Coming here! And it seemed to\\r\\nhim all at once that he was turned to stone, that it was like a dream\\r\\nin which one is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and is\\r\\nrooted to the spot and cannot even move one’s arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor, he suddenly\\r\\nstarted, and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the\\r\\nflat and closing the door behind him. Then he took the hook and softly,\\r\\nnoiselessly, fixed it in the catch. Instinct helped him. When he had\\r\\ndone this, he crouched holding his breath, by the door. The unknown\\r\\nvisitor was by now also at the door. They were now standing opposite one\\r\\nanother, as he had just before been standing with the old woman, when\\r\\nthe door divided them and he was listening.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visitor panted several times. “He must be a big, fat man,” thought\\r\\nRaskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand. It seemed like a dream\\r\\nindeed. The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to be aware of\\r\\nsomething moving in the room. For some seconds he listened quite\\r\\nseriously. The unknown rang again, waited and suddenly tugged violently\\r\\nand impatiently at the handle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed in horror\\r\\nat the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected every\\r\\nminute that the fastening would be pulled out. It certainly did seem\\r\\npossible, so violently was he shaking it. He was tempted to hold the\\r\\nfastening, but _he_ might be aware of it. A giddiness came over him\\r\\nagain. “I shall fall down!” flashed through his mind, but the unknown\\r\\nbegan to speak and he recovered himself at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s up? Are they asleep or murdered? D-damn them!” he bawled in a\\r\\nthick voice, “Hey, Alyona Ivanovna, old witch! Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey,\\r\\nmy beauty! open the door! Oh, damn them! Are they asleep or what?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen times at\\r\\nthe bell. He must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate\\r\\nacquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on the\\r\\nstairs. Someone else was approaching. Raskolnikov had not heard them at\\r\\nfirst.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t say there’s no one at home,” the new-comer cried in a\\r\\ncheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, who still went on\\r\\npulling the bell. “Good evening, Koch.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“From his voice he must be quite young,” thought Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who the devil can tell? I’ve almost broken the lock,” answered Koch.\\r\\n“But how do you come to know me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why! The day before yesterday I beat you three times running at\\r\\nbilliards at Gambrinus’.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So they are not at home? That’s queer. It’s awfully stupid though.\\r\\nWhere could the old woman have gone? I’ve come on business.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes; and I have business with her, too.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, what can we do? Go back, I suppose, Aie--aie! And I was hoping to\\r\\nget some money!” cried the young man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We must give it up, of course, but what did she fix this time for? The\\r\\nold witch fixed the time for me to come herself. It’s out of my way.\\r\\nAnd where the devil she can have got to, I can’t make out. She sits here\\r\\nfrom year’s end to year’s end, the old hag; her legs are bad and yet\\r\\nhere all of a sudden she is out for a walk!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hadn’t we better ask the porter?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where she’s gone and when she’ll be back.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hm.... Damn it all!... We might ask.... But you know she never does go\\r\\nanywhere.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he once more tugged at the door-handle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Damn it all. There’s nothing to be done, we must go!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stay!” cried the young man suddenly. “Do you see how the door shakes if\\r\\nyou pull it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That shows it’s not locked, but fastened with the hook! Do you hear how\\r\\nthe hook clanks?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, don’t you see? That proves that one of them is at home. If they\\r\\nwere all out, they would have locked the door from the outside with the\\r\\nkey and not with the hook from inside. There, do you hear how the hook\\r\\nis clanking? To fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home,\\r\\ndon’t you see. So there they are sitting inside and don’t open the\\r\\ndoor!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well! And so they must be!” cried Koch, astonished. “What are they\\r\\nabout in there?” And he began furiously shaking the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stay!” cried the young man again. “Don’t pull at it! There must be\\r\\nsomething wrong.... Here, you’ve been ringing and pulling at the door\\r\\nand still they don’t open! So either they’ve both fainted or...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I tell you what. Let’s go fetch the porter, let him wake them up.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth were going down.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stay. You stop here while I run down for the porter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What for?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you’d better.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m studying the law you see! It’s evident, e-vi-dent there’s something\\r\\nwrong here!” the young man cried hotly, and he ran downstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nKoch remained. Once more he softly touched the bell which gave one\\r\\ntinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and looking about him, began\\r\\ntouching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once\\r\\nmore that it was only fastened by the hook. Then puffing and panting he\\r\\nbent down and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in the lock\\r\\non the inside and so nothing could be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe. He was in a sort of\\r\\ndelirium. He was even making ready to fight when they should come in.\\r\\nWhile they were knocking and talking together, the idea several times\\r\\noccurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through the\\r\\ndoor. Now and then he was tempted to swear at them, to jeer at them,\\r\\nwhile they could not open the door! “Only make haste!” was the thought\\r\\nthat flashed through his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what the devil is he about?...” Time was passing, one minute, and\\r\\nanother--no one came. Koch began to be restless.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What the devil?” he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his\\r\\nsentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and thumping with his heavy\\r\\nboots on the stairs. The steps died away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens! What am I to do?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door--there was no sound.\\r\\nAbruptly, without any thought at all, he went out, closing the door as\\r\\nthoroughly as he could, and went downstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice\\r\\nbelow--where could he go! There was nowhere to hide. He was just going\\r\\nback to the flat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hey there! Catch the brute!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSomebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rather fell than ran\\r\\ndown the stairs, bawling at the top of his voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Blast him!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all was\\r\\nstill. But at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began\\r\\nnoisily mounting the stairs. There were three or four of them. He\\r\\ndistinguished the ringing voice of the young man. “Hey!”\\r\\n\\r\\nFilled with despair he went straight to meet them, feeling “come what\\r\\nmust!” If they stopped him--all was lost; if they let him pass--all was\\r\\nlost too; they would remember him. They were approaching; they were only\\r\\na flight from him--and suddenly deliverance! A few steps from him on the\\r\\nright, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, the flat on the\\r\\nsecond floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as though\\r\\nfor his benefit, they had just left. It was they, no doubt, who had just\\r\\nrun down, shouting. The floor had only just been painted, in the middle\\r\\nof the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes. In one\\r\\ninstant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall\\r\\nand only in the nick of time; they had already reached the landing.\\r\\nThen they turned and went on up to the fourth floor, talking loudly. He\\r\\nwaited, went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway. He passed quickly through\\r\\nthe gateway and turned to the left in the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the\\r\\nflat, that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked, as\\r\\nthe door had just been fastened, that by now they were looking at the\\r\\nbodies, that before another minute had passed they would guess and\\r\\ncompletely realise that the murderer had just been there, and had\\r\\nsucceeded in hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping. They would\\r\\nguess most likely that he had been in the empty flat, while they were\\r\\ngoing upstairs. And meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much, though\\r\\nthe next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away. “Should he\\r\\nslip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street? No,\\r\\nhopeless! Should he fling away the axe? Should he take a cab? Hopeless,\\r\\nhopeless!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last he reached the turning. He turned down it more dead than alive.\\r\\nHere he was half way to safety, and he understood it; it was less risky\\r\\nbecause there was a great crowd of people, and he was lost in it like a\\r\\ngrain of sand. But all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could\\r\\nscarcely move. Perspiration ran down him in drops, his neck was all wet.\\r\\n“My word, he has been going it!” someone shouted at him when he came out\\r\\non the canal bank.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the farther he went the\\r\\nworse it was. He remembered however, that on coming out on to the canal\\r\\nbank, he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more\\r\\nconspicuous, and he had thought of turning back. Though he was almost\\r\\nfalling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get home from\\r\\nquite a different direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his\\r\\nhouse! He was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe.\\r\\nAnd yet he had a very grave problem before him, to put it back and to\\r\\nescape observation as far as possible in doing so. He was of course\\r\\nincapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to\\r\\nrestore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebody’s yard. But\\r\\nit all happened fortunately, the door of the porter’s room was closed\\r\\nbut not locked, so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at\\r\\nhome. But he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he\\r\\nwalked straight to the door and opened it. If the porter had asked him,\\r\\n“What do you want?” he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe. But\\r\\nagain the porter was not at home, and he succeeded in putting the axe\\r\\nback under the bench, and even covering it with the chunk of wood as\\r\\nbefore. He met no one, not a soul, afterwards on the way to his room;\\r\\nthe landlady’s door was shut. When he was in his room, he flung himself\\r\\non the sofa just as he was--he did not sleep, but sank into blank\\r\\nforgetfulness. If anyone had come into his room then, he would have\\r\\njumped up at once and screamed. Scraps and shreds of thoughts were\\r\\nsimply swarming in his brain, but he could not catch at one, he could\\r\\nnot rest on one, in spite of all his efforts....\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART II\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he lay a very long while. Now and then he seemed to wake up, and at\\r\\nsuch moments he noticed that it was far into the night, but it did not\\r\\noccur to him to get up. At last he noticed that it was beginning to get\\r\\nlight. He was lying on his back, still dazed from his recent oblivion.\\r\\nFearful, despairing cries rose shrilly from the street, sounds which he\\r\\nheard every night, indeed, under his window after two o’clock. They woke\\r\\nhim up now.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah! the drunken men are coming out of the taverns,” he thought, “it’s\\r\\npast two o’clock,” and at once he leaped up, as though someone had\\r\\npulled him from the sofa.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What! Past two o’clock!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat down on the sofa--and instantly recollected everything! All at\\r\\nonce, in one flash, he recollected everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first moment he thought he was going mad. A dreadful chill came\\r\\nover him; but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in\\r\\nhis sleep. Now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering, so that his\\r\\nteeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking. He opened the door and\\r\\nbegan listening--everything in the house was asleep. With amazement he\\r\\ngazed at himself and everything in the room around him, wondering how he\\r\\ncould have come in the night before without fastening the door, and have\\r\\nflung himself on the sofa without undressing, without even taking his\\r\\nhat off. It had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If anyone had come in, what would he have thought? That I’m drunk\\r\\nbut...”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rushed to the window. There was light enough, and he began hurriedly\\r\\nlooking himself all over from head to foot, all his clothes; were there\\r\\nno traces? But there was no doing it like that; shivering with cold, he\\r\\nbegan taking off everything and looking over again. He turned everything\\r\\nover to the last threads and rags, and mistrusting himself, went through\\r\\nhis search three times.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in one place, where\\r\\nsome thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge\\r\\nof his trousers. He picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed\\r\\nthreads. There seemed to be nothing more.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of\\r\\nthe old woman’s box were still in his pockets! He had not thought till\\r\\nthen of taking them out and hiding them! He had not even thought of them\\r\\nwhile he was examining his clothes! What next? Instantly he rushed\\r\\nto take them out and fling them on the table. When he had pulled out\\r\\neverything, and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was\\r\\nnothing left, he carried the whole heap to the corner. The paper had\\r\\ncome off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters. He began\\r\\nstuffing all the things into the hole under the paper: “They’re in! All\\r\\nout of sight, and the purse too!” he thought gleefully, getting up and\\r\\ngazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever. Suddenly\\r\\nhe shuddered all over with horror; “My God!” he whispered in despair:\\r\\n“what’s the matter with me? Is that hidden? Is that the way to hide\\r\\nthings?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide. He had only thought of\\r\\nmoney, and so had not prepared a hiding-place.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But now, now, what am I glad of?” he thought, “Is that hiding things?\\r\\nMy reason’s deserting me--simply!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another\\r\\nunbearable fit of shivering. Mechanically he drew from a chair beside\\r\\nhim his old student’s winter coat, which was still warm though almost in\\r\\nrags, covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and\\r\\ndelirium. He lost consciousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time,\\r\\nand at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How could I go to sleep again with nothing done? Yes, yes; I have not\\r\\ntaken the loop off the armhole! I forgot it, forgot a thing like that!\\r\\nSuch a piece of evidence!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits\\r\\namong his linen under the pillow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pieces of torn linen couldn’t rouse suspicion, whatever happened; I\\r\\nthink not, I think not, any way!” he repeated, standing in the middle\\r\\nof the room, and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about\\r\\nhim again, at the floor and everywhere, trying to make sure he had not\\r\\nforgotten anything. The conviction that all his faculties, even memory,\\r\\nand the simplest power of reflection were failing him, began to be an\\r\\ninsufferable torture.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Surely it isn’t beginning already! Surely it isn’t my punishment coming\\r\\nupon me? It is!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the\\r\\nfloor in the middle of the room, where anyone coming in would see them!\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is the matter with me!” he cried again, like one distraught.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a strange idea entered his head; that, perhaps, all his clothes\\r\\nwere covered with blood, that, perhaps, there were a great many\\r\\nstains, but that he did not see them, did not notice them because\\r\\nhis perceptions were failing, were going to pieces... his reason was\\r\\nclouded.... Suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the\\r\\npurse too. “Ah! Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I put\\r\\nthe wet purse in my pocket!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and, yes!--there were\\r\\ntraces, stains on the lining of the pocket!\\r\\n\\r\\n“So my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have some sense and\\r\\nmemory, since I guessed it of myself,” he thought triumphantly, with\\r\\na deep sigh of relief; “it’s simply the weakness of fever, a moment’s\\r\\ndelirium,” and he tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of his\\r\\ntrousers. At that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on the\\r\\nsock which poked out from the boot, he fancied there were traces! He\\r\\nflung off his boots; “traces indeed! The tip of the sock was soaked with\\r\\nblood;” he must have unwarily stepped into that pool.... “But what am I\\r\\nto do with this now? Where am I to put the sock and rags and pocket?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the middle of the\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the stove? But they would ransack the stove first of all. Burn them?\\r\\nBut what can I burn them with? There are no matches even. No, better\\r\\ngo out and throw it all away somewhere. Yes, better throw it away,” he\\r\\nrepeated, sitting down on the sofa again, “and at once, this minute,\\r\\nwithout lingering...”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut his head sank on the pillow instead. Again the unbearable icy\\r\\nshivering came over him; again he drew his coat over him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd for a long while, for some hours, he was haunted by the impulse to\\r\\n“go off somewhere at once, this moment, and fling it all away, so that\\r\\nit may be out of sight and done with, at once, at once!” Several times\\r\\nhe tried to rise from the sofa, but could not.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Open, do, are you dead or alive? He keeps sleeping here!” shouted\\r\\nNastasya, banging with her fist on the door. “For whole days together\\r\\nhe’s snoring here like a dog! A dog he is too. Open I tell you. It’s\\r\\npast ten.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Maybe he’s not at home,” said a man’s voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ha! that’s the porter’s voice.... What does he want?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe jumped up and sat on the sofa. The beating of his heart was a\\r\\npositive pain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then who can have latched the door?” retorted Nastasya. “He’s taken to\\r\\nbolting himself in! As if he were worth stealing! Open, you stupid, wake\\r\\nup!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do they want? Why the porter? All’s discovered. Resist or open?\\r\\nCome what may!...”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe half rose, stooped forward and unlatched the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the\\r\\nbed. Yes; the porter and Nastasya were standing there.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasya stared at him in a strange way. He glanced with a defiant and\\r\\ndesperate air at the porter, who without a word held out a grey folded\\r\\npaper sealed with bottle-wax.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A notice from the office,” he announced, as he gave him the paper.\\r\\n\\r\\n“From what office?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A summons to the police office, of course. You know which office.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To the police?... What for?...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How can I tell? You’re sent for, so you go.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man looked at him attentively, looked round the room and turned to\\r\\ngo away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s downright ill!” observed Nastasya, not taking her eyes off him.\\r\\nThe porter turned his head for a moment. “He’s been in a fever since\\r\\nyesterday,” she added.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands, without\\r\\nopening it. “Don’t you get up then,” Nastasya went on compassionately,\\r\\nseeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa. “You’re ill, and\\r\\nso don’t go; there’s no such hurry. What have you got there?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had cut from his\\r\\ntrousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket. So he had been asleep\\r\\nwith them in his hand. Afterwards reflecting upon it, he remembered that\\r\\nhalf waking up in his fever, he had grasped all this tightly in his hand\\r\\nand so fallen asleep again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look at the rags he’s collected and sleeps with them, as though he has\\r\\ngot hold of a treasure...”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his\\r\\neyes intently upon her. Far as he was from being capable of rational\\r\\nreflection at that moment, he felt that no one would behave like that\\r\\nwith a person who was going to be arrested. “But... the police?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’d better have some tea! Yes? I’ll bring it, there’s some left.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No... I’m going; I’ll go at once,” he muttered, getting on to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, you’ll never get downstairs!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I’ll go.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As you please.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe followed the porter out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with dirt,\\r\\nand rubbed and already discoloured. No one who had no suspicion could\\r\\ndistinguish anything. Nastasya from a distance could not have noticed,\\r\\nthank God!” Then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began\\r\\nreading; he was a long while reading, before he understood. It was an\\r\\nordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day at\\r\\nhalf-past nine at the office of the district superintendent.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But when has such a thing happened? I never have anything to do with\\r\\nthe police! And why just to-day?” he thought in agonising bewilderment.\\r\\n“Good God, only get it over soon!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke into\\r\\nlaughter--not at the idea of prayer, but at himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began, hurriedly dressing. “If I’m lost, I am lost, I don’t care!\\r\\nShall I put the sock on?” he suddenly wondered, “it will get dustier\\r\\nstill and the traces will be gone.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing\\r\\nand horror. He pulled it off, but reflecting that he had no other socks,\\r\\nhe picked it up and put it on again--and again he laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s all conventional, that’s all relative, merely a way of looking\\r\\nat it,” he thought in a flash, but only on the top surface of his\\r\\nmind, while he was shuddering all over, “there, I’ve got it on! I have\\r\\nfinished by getting it on!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut his laughter was quickly followed by despair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, it’s too much for me...” he thought. His legs shook. “From fear,”\\r\\n he muttered. His head swam and ached with fever. “It’s a trick! They\\r\\nwant to decoy me there and confound me over everything,” he mused, as\\r\\nhe went out on to the stairs--“the worst of it is I’m almost\\r\\nlight-headed... I may blurt out something stupid...”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just as\\r\\nthey were in the hole in the wall, “and very likely, it’s on purpose\\r\\nto search when I’m out,” he thought, and stopped short. But he was\\r\\npossessed by such despair, such cynicism of misery, if one may so call\\r\\nit, that with a wave of his hand he went on. “Only to get it over!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop of rain had\\r\\nfallen all those days. Again dust, bricks and mortar, again the stench\\r\\nfrom the shops and pot-houses, again the drunken men, the Finnish\\r\\npedlars and half-broken-down cabs. The sun shone straight in his eyes,\\r\\nso that it hurt him to look out of them, and he felt his head going\\r\\nround--as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the\\r\\nstreet on a bright sunny day.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he reached the turning into _the_ street, in an agony of\\r\\ntrepidation he looked down it... at _the_ house... and at once averted\\r\\nhis eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If they question me, perhaps I’ll simply tell,” he thought, as he drew\\r\\nnear the police-station.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe police-station was about a quarter of a mile off. It had lately been\\r\\nmoved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house. He had been once\\r\\nfor a moment in the old office but long ago. Turning in at the gateway,\\r\\nhe saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with\\r\\na book in his hand. “A house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office is\\r\\nhere,” and he began ascending the stairs on the chance. He did not want\\r\\nto ask questions of anyone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll go in, fall on my knees, and confess everything...” he thought, as\\r\\nhe reached the fourth floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty water. The\\r\\nkitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost\\r\\nthe whole day. So there was a fearful smell and heat. The staircase\\r\\nwas crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their\\r\\narms, policemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes. The door of\\r\\nthe office, too, stood wide open. Peasants stood waiting within. There,\\r\\ntoo, the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh\\r\\npaint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter waiting a little, he decided to move forward into the next room.\\r\\nAll the rooms were small and low-pitched. A fearful impatience drew him\\r\\non and on. No one paid attention to him. In the second room some\\r\\nclerks sat writing, dressed hardly better than he was, and rather a\\r\\nqueer-looking set. He went up to one of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe showed the notice he had received.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a student?” the man asked, glancing at the notice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, formerly a student.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clerk looked at him, but without the slightest interest. He was a\\r\\nparticularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There would be no getting anything out of him, because he has no\\r\\ninterest in anything,” thought Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go in there to the head clerk,” said the clerk, pointing towards the\\r\\nfurthest room.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went into that room--the fourth in order; it was a small room and\\r\\npacked full of people, rather better dressed than in the outer rooms.\\r\\nAmong them were two ladies. One, poorly dressed in mourning, sat at the\\r\\ntable opposite the chief clerk, writing something at his dictation.\\r\\nThe other, a very stout, buxom woman with a purplish-red, blotchy face,\\r\\nexcessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a\\r\\nsaucer, was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something.\\r\\nRaskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk. The latter glanced\\r\\nat it, said: “Wait a minute,” and went on attending to the lady in\\r\\nmourning.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe breathed more freely. “It can’t be that!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBy degrees he began to regain confidence, he kept urging himself to have\\r\\ncourage and be calm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Some foolishness, some trifling carelessness, and I may betray myself!\\r\\nHm... it’s a pity there’s no air here,” he added, “it’s stifling.... It\\r\\nmakes one’s head dizzier than ever... and one’s mind too...”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil. He was afraid of losing\\r\\nhis self-control; he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it,\\r\\nsomething quite irrelevant, but he could not succeed in this at all. Yet\\r\\nthe head clerk greatly interested him, he kept hoping to see through him\\r\\nand guess something from his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a dark mobile\\r\\nface that looked older than his years. He was fashionably dressed and\\r\\nfoppish, with his hair parted in the middle, well combed and pomaded,\\r\\nand wore a number of rings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain\\r\\non his waistcoat. He said a couple of words in French to a foreigner who\\r\\nwas in the room, and said them fairly correctly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Luise Ivanovna, you can sit down,” he said casually to the\\r\\ngaily-dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as though not\\r\\nventuring to sit down, though there was a chair beside her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ich danke,” said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk she sank\\r\\ninto the chair. Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated\\r\\nabout the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room. She\\r\\nsmelt of scent. But she was obviously embarrassed at filling half\\r\\nthe room and smelling so strongly of scent; and though her smile was\\r\\nimpudent as well as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lady in mourning had done at last, and got up. All at once, with\\r\\nsome noise, an officer walked in very jauntily, with a peculiar swing of\\r\\nhis shoulders at each step. He tossed his cockaded cap on the table and\\r\\nsat down in an easy-chair. The small lady positively skipped from her\\r\\nseat on seeing him, and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; but the\\r\\nofficer took not the smallest notice of her, and she did not venture to\\r\\nsit down again in his presence. He was the assistant superintendent. He\\r\\nhad a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his\\r\\nface, and extremely small features, expressive of nothing much except\\r\\na certain insolence. He looked askance and rather indignantly at\\r\\nRaskolnikov; he was so very badly dressed, and in spite of his\\r\\nhumiliating position, his bearing was by no means in keeping with his\\r\\nclothes. Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on\\r\\nhim, so that he felt positively affronted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you want?” he shouted, apparently astonished that such a ragged\\r\\nfellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his glance.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was summoned... by a notice...” Raskolnikov faltered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“For the recovery of money due, from _the student_,” the head clerk\\r\\ninterfered hurriedly, tearing himself from his papers. “Here!” and he\\r\\nflung Raskolnikov a document and pointed out the place. “Read that!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Money? What money?” thought Raskolnikov, “but... then... it’s certainly\\r\\nnot _that_.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he trembled with joy. He felt sudden intense indescribable relief. A\\r\\nload was lifted from his back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And pray, what time were you directed to appear, sir?” shouted the\\r\\nassistant superintendent, seeming for some unknown reason more and more\\r\\naggrieved. “You are told to come at nine, and now it’s twelve!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago,” Raskolnikov\\r\\nanswered loudly over his shoulder. To his own surprise he, too, grew\\r\\nsuddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it. “And it’s enough that\\r\\nI have come here ill with fever.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kindly refrain from shouting!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not shouting, I’m speaking very quietly, it’s you who are shouting\\r\\nat me. I’m a student, and allow no one to shout at me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he\\r\\ncould only splutter inarticulately. He leaped up from his seat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Be silent! You are in a government office. Don’t be impudent, sir!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re in a government office, too,” cried Raskolnikov, “and you’re\\r\\nsmoking a cigarette as well as shouting, so you are showing disrespect\\r\\nto all of us.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe head clerk looked at him with a smile. The angry assistant\\r\\nsuperintendent was obviously disconcerted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s not your business!” he shouted at last with unnatural loudness.\\r\\n“Kindly make the declaration demanded of you. Show him. Alexandr\\r\\nGrigorievitch. There is a complaint against you! You don’t pay your\\r\\ndebts! You’re a fine bird!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Raskolnikov was not listening now; he had eagerly clutched at the\\r\\npaper, in haste to find an explanation. He read it once, and a second\\r\\ntime, and still did not understand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is this?” he asked the head clerk.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is for the recovery of money on an I O U, a writ. You must\\r\\neither pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give a written\\r\\ndeclaration when you can pay it, and at the same time an undertaking not\\r\\nto leave the capital without payment, and nor to sell or conceal your\\r\\nproperty. The creditor is at liberty to sell your property, and proceed\\r\\nagainst you according to the law.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I... am not in debt to anyone!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s not our business. Here, an I O U for a hundred and fifteen\\r\\nroubles, legally attested, and due for payment, has been brought us\\r\\nfor recovery, given by you to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn, nine\\r\\nmonths ago, and paid over by the widow Zarnitsyn to one Mr. Tchebarov.\\r\\nWe therefore summon you, hereupon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But she is my landlady!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what if she is your landlady?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion,\\r\\nand at the same time with a certain triumph, as at a novice under fire\\r\\nfor the first time--as though he would say: “Well, how do you feel now?”\\r\\n But what did he care now for an I O U, for a writ of recovery! Was that\\r\\nworth worrying about now, was it worth attention even! He stood, he\\r\\nread, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions himself, but\\r\\nall mechanically. The triumphant sense of security, of deliverance from\\r\\noverwhelming danger, that was what filled his whole soul that moment\\r\\nwithout thought for the future, without analysis, without suppositions\\r\\nor surmises, without doubts and without questioning. It was an instant\\r\\nof full, direct, purely instinctive joy. But at that very moment\\r\\nsomething like a thunderstorm took place in the office. The assistant\\r\\nsuperintendent, still shaken by Raskolnikov’s disrespect, still fuming\\r\\nand obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity, pounced on the\\r\\nunfortunate smart lady, who had been gazing at him ever since he came in\\r\\nwith an exceedingly silly smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You shameful hussy!” he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice. (The\\r\\nlady in mourning had left the office.) “What was going on at your house\\r\\nlast night? Eh! A disgrace again, you’re a scandal to the whole street.\\r\\nFighting and drinking again. Do you want the house of correction? Why,\\r\\nI have warned you ten times over that I would not let you off the\\r\\neleventh! And here you are again, again, you... you...!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe paper fell out of Raskolnikov’s hands, and he looked wildly at the\\r\\nsmart lady who was so unceremoniously treated. But he soon saw what it\\r\\nmeant, and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal. He\\r\\nlistened with pleasure, so that he longed to laugh and laugh... all his\\r\\nnerves were on edge.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ilya Petrovitch!” the head clerk was beginning anxiously, but stopped\\r\\nshort, for he knew from experience that the enraged assistant could not\\r\\nbe stopped except by force.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the smart lady, at first she positively trembled before the\\r\\nstorm. But, strange to say, the more numerous and violent the terms of\\r\\nabuse became, the more amiable she looked, and the more seductive the\\r\\nsmiles she lavished on the terrible assistant. She moved uneasily, and\\r\\ncurtsied incessantly, waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her\\r\\nword: and at last she found it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was no sort of noise or fighting in my house, Mr. Captain,” she\\r\\npattered all at once, like peas dropping, speaking Russian confidently,\\r\\nthough with a strong German accent, “and no sort of scandal, and his\\r\\nhonour came drunk, and it’s the whole truth I am telling, Mr. Captain,\\r\\nand I am not to blame.... Mine is an honourable house, Mr. Captain,\\r\\nand honourable behaviour, Mr. Captain, and I always, always dislike any\\r\\nscandal myself. But he came quite tipsy, and asked for three bottles\\r\\nagain, and then he lifted up one leg, and began playing the pianoforte\\r\\nwith one foot, and that is not at all right in an honourable house, and\\r\\nhe _ganz_ broke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed and I said\\r\\nso. And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it. And then\\r\\nI called the porter, and Karl came, and he took Karl and hit him in the\\r\\neye; and he hit Henriette in the eye, too, and gave me five slaps on the\\r\\ncheek. And it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house, Mr. Captain,\\r\\nand I screamed. And he opened the window over the canal, and stood in\\r\\nthe window, squealing like a little pig; it was a disgrace. The idea of\\r\\nsquealing like a little pig at the window into the street! Fie upon him!\\r\\nAnd Karl pulled him away from the window by his coat, and it is true,\\r\\nMr. Captain, he tore _sein rock_. And then he shouted that _man muss_\\r\\npay him fifteen roubles damages. And I did pay him, Mr. Captain, five\\r\\nroubles for _sein rock_. And he is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused\\r\\nall the scandal. ‘I will show you up,’ he said, ‘for I can write to all\\r\\nthe papers about you.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then he was an author?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Mr. Captain, and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable\\r\\nhouse....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now then! Enough! I have told you already...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ilya Petrovitch!” the head clerk repeated significantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk slightly shook his\\r\\nhead.\\r\\n\\r\\n“... So I tell you this, most respectable Luise Ivanovna, and I tell it\\r\\nyou for the last time,” the assistant went on. “If there is a scandal\\r\\nin your honourable house once again, I will put you yourself in the\\r\\nlock-up, as it is called in polite society. Do you hear? So a literary\\r\\nman, an author took five roubles for his coat-tail in an ‘honourable\\r\\nhouse’? A nice set, these authors!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov. “There was a scandal\\r\\nthe other day in a restaurant, too. An author had eaten his dinner and\\r\\nwould not pay; ‘I’ll write a satire on you,’ says he. And there was\\r\\nanother of them on a steamer last week used the most disgraceful\\r\\nlanguage to the respectable family of a civil councillor, his wife and\\r\\ndaughter. And there was one of them turned out of a confectioner’s shop\\r\\nthe other day. They are like that, authors, literary men, students,\\r\\ntown-criers.... Pfoo! You get along! I shall look in upon you myself one\\r\\nday. Then you had better be careful! Do you hear?”\\r\\n\\r\\nWith hurried deference, Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying in all\\r\\ndirections, and so curtsied herself to the door. But at the door, she\\r\\nstumbled backwards against a good-looking officer with a fresh, open\\r\\nface and splendid thick fair whiskers. This was the superintendent of\\r\\nthe district himself, Nikodim Fomitch. Luise Ivanovna made haste\\r\\nto curtsy almost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, she\\r\\nfluttered out of the office.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Again thunder and lightning--a hurricane!” said Nikodim Fomitch to Ilya\\r\\nPetrovitch in a civil and friendly tone. “You are aroused again, you are\\r\\nfuming again! I heard it on the stairs!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, what then!” Ilya Petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance;\\r\\nand he walked with some papers to another table, with a jaunty swing of\\r\\nhis shoulders at each step. “Here, if you will kindly look: an author,\\r\\nor a student, has been one at least, does not pay his debts, has given\\r\\nan I O U, won’t clear out of his room, and complaints are constantly\\r\\nbeing lodged against him, and here he has been pleased to make a protest\\r\\nagainst my smoking in his presence! He behaves like a cad himself, and\\r\\njust look at him, please. Here’s the gentleman, and very attractive he\\r\\nis!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poverty is not a vice, my friend, but we know you go off like powder,\\r\\nyou can’t bear a slight, I daresay you took offence at something and\\r\\nwent too far yourself,” continued Nikodim Fomitch, turning affably to\\r\\nRaskolnikov. “But you were wrong there; he is a capital fellow, I assure\\r\\nyou, but explosive, explosive! He gets hot, fires up, boils over, and no\\r\\nstopping him! And then it’s all over! And at the bottom he’s a heart of\\r\\ngold! His nickname in the regiment was the Explosive Lieutenant....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what a regiment it was, too,” cried Ilya Petrovitch, much gratified\\r\\nat this agreeable banter, though still sulky.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something exceptionally pleasant\\r\\nto them all. “Excuse me, Captain,” he began easily, suddenly addressing\\r\\nNikodim Fomitch, “will you enter into my position?... I am ready to\\r\\nask pardon, if I have been ill-mannered. I am a poor student, sick\\r\\nand shattered (shattered was the word he used) by poverty. I am not\\r\\nstudying, because I cannot keep myself now, but I shall get money.... I\\r\\nhave a mother and sister in the province of X. They will send it to\\r\\nme, and I will pay. My landlady is a good-hearted woman, but she is so\\r\\nexasperated at my having lost my lessons, and not paying her for the\\r\\nlast four months, that she does not even send up my dinner... and I\\r\\ndon’t understand this I O U at all. She is asking me to pay her on this\\r\\nI O U. How am I to pay her? Judge for yourselves!...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But that is not our business, you know,” the head clerk was observing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes. I perfectly agree with you. But allow me to explain...”\\r\\n Raskolnikov put in again, still addressing Nikodim Fomitch, but trying\\r\\nhis best to address Ilya Petrovitch also, though the latter persistently\\r\\nappeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously\\r\\noblivious of him. “Allow me to explain that I have been living with her\\r\\nfor nearly three years and at first... at first... for why should I not\\r\\nconfess it, at the very beginning I promised to marry her daughter, it\\r\\nwas a verbal promise, freely given... she was a girl... indeed, I liked\\r\\nher, though I was not in love with her... a youthful affair in fact...\\r\\nthat is, I mean to say, that my landlady gave me credit freely in those\\r\\ndays, and I led a life of... I was very heedless...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nobody asks you for these personal details, sir, we’ve no time to\\r\\nwaste,” Ilya Petrovitch interposed roughly and with a note of triumph;\\r\\nbut Raskolnikov stopped him hotly, though he suddenly found it\\r\\nexceedingly difficult to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But excuse me, excuse me. It is for me to explain... how it all\\r\\nhappened... In my turn... though I agree with you... it is unnecessary.\\r\\nBut a year ago, the girl died of typhus. I remained lodging there as\\r\\nbefore, and when my landlady moved into her present quarters, she said\\r\\nto me... and in a friendly way... that she had complete trust in me,\\r\\nbut still, would I not give her an I O U for one hundred and fifteen\\r\\nroubles, all the debt I owed her. She said if only I gave her that,\\r\\nshe would trust me again, as much as I liked, and that she would never,\\r\\nnever--those were her own words--make use of that I O U till I could pay\\r\\nof myself... and now, when I have lost my lessons and have nothing to\\r\\neat, she takes action against me. What am I to say to that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All these affecting details are no business of ours.” Ilya Petrovitch\\r\\ninterrupted rudely. “You must give a written undertaking but as for your\\r\\nlove affairs and all these tragic events, we have nothing to do with\\r\\nthat.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come now... you are harsh,” muttered Nikodim Fomitch, sitting down at\\r\\nthe table and also beginning to write. He looked a little ashamed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Write!” said the head clerk to Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Write what?” the latter asked, gruffly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will dictate to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually and\\r\\ncontemptuously after his speech, but strange to say he suddenly felt\\r\\ncompletely indifferent to anyone’s opinion, and this revulsion took\\r\\nplace in a flash, in one instant. If he had cared to think a little,\\r\\nhe would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like\\r\\nthat a minute before, forcing his feelings upon them. And where had\\r\\nthose feelings come from? Now if the whole room had been filled, not\\r\\nwith police officers, but with those nearest and dearest to him, he\\r\\nwould not have found one human word for them, so empty was his heart. A\\r\\ngloomy sensation of agonising, everlasting solitude and remoteness, took\\r\\nconscious form in his soul. It was not the meanness of his sentimental\\r\\neffusions before Ilya Petrovitch, nor the meanness of the latter’s\\r\\ntriumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart.\\r\\nOh, what had he to do now with his own baseness, with all these petty\\r\\nvanities, officers, German women, debts, police-offices? If he had been\\r\\nsentenced to be burnt at that moment, he would not have stirred, would\\r\\nhardly have heard the sentence to the end. Something was happening to\\r\\nhim entirely new, sudden and unknown. It was not that he understood, but\\r\\nhe felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could\\r\\nnever more appeal to these people in the police-office with sentimental\\r\\neffusions like his recent outburst, or with anything whatever; and that\\r\\nif they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police-officers,\\r\\nit would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any\\r\\ncircumstance of life. He had never experienced such a strange and awful\\r\\nsensation. And what was most agonising--it was more a sensation than a\\r\\nconception or idea, a direct sensation, the most agonising of all the\\r\\nsensations he had known in his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of declaration,\\r\\nthat he could not pay, that he undertook to do so at a future date, that\\r\\nhe would not leave the town, nor sell his property, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you can’t write, you can hardly hold the pen,” observed the head\\r\\nclerk, looking with curiosity at Raskolnikov. “Are you ill?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I am giddy. Go on!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s all. Sign it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe head clerk took the paper, and turned to attend to others.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting up and going away,\\r\\nhe put his elbows on the table and pressed his head in his hands. He\\r\\nfelt as if a nail were being driven into his skull. A strange idea\\r\\nsuddenly occurred to him, to get up at once, to go up to Nikodim\\r\\nFomitch, and tell him everything that had happened yesterday, and then\\r\\nto go with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the hole\\r\\nin the corner. The impulse was so strong that he got up from his seat\\r\\nto carry it out. “Hadn’t I better think a minute?” flashed through his\\r\\nmind. “No, better cast off the burden without thinking.” But all at once\\r\\nhe stood still, rooted to the spot. Nikodim Fomitch was talking eagerly\\r\\nwith Ilya Petrovitch, and the words reached him:\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s impossible, they’ll both be released. To begin with, the whole\\r\\nstory contradicts itself. Why should they have called the porter, if it\\r\\nhad been their doing? To inform against themselves? Or as a blind? No,\\r\\nthat would be too cunning! Besides, Pestryakov, the student, was seen at\\r\\nthe gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in. He was walking\\r\\nwith three friends, who left him only at the gate, and he asked the\\r\\nporters to direct him, in the presence of the friends. Now, would he\\r\\nhave asked his way if he had been going with such an object? As for\\r\\nKoch, he spent half an hour at the silversmith’s below, before he went\\r\\nup to the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight. Now\\r\\njust consider...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But excuse me, how do you explain this contradiction? They state\\r\\nthemselves that they knocked and the door was locked; yet three minutes\\r\\nlater when they went up with the porter, it turned out the door was\\r\\nunfastened.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s just it; the murderer must have been there and bolted himself\\r\\nin; and they’d have caught him for a certainty if Koch had not been\\r\\nan ass and gone to look for the porter too. _He_ must have seized the\\r\\ninterval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow. Koch keeps crossing\\r\\nhimself and saying: ‘If I had been there, he would have jumped out and\\r\\nkilled me with his axe.’ He is going to have a thanksgiving service--ha,\\r\\nha!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And no one saw the murderer?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They might well not see him; the house is a regular Noah’s Ark,” said\\r\\nthe head clerk, who was listening.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s clear, quite clear,” Nikodim Fomitch repeated warmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, it is anything but clear,” Ilya Petrovitch maintained.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov picked up his hat and walked towards the door, but he did\\r\\nnot reach it....\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he recovered consciousness, he found himself sitting in a chair,\\r\\nsupported by someone on the right side, while someone else was standing\\r\\non the left, holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water, and\\r\\nNikodim Fomitch standing before him, looking intently at him. He got up\\r\\nfrom the chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s this? Are you ill?” Nikodim Fomitch asked, rather sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He could hardly hold his pen when he was signing,” said the head clerk,\\r\\nsettling back in his place, and taking up his work again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you been ill long?” cried Ilya Petrovitch from his place, where\\r\\nhe, too, was looking through papers. He had, of course, come to look at\\r\\nthe sick man when he fainted, but retired at once when he recovered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Since yesterday,” muttered Raskolnikov in reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you go out yesterday?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Though you were ill?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“At what time?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“About seven.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And where did you go, may I ask?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Along the street.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Short and clear.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov, white as a handkerchief, had answered sharply, jerkily,\\r\\nwithout dropping his black feverish eyes before Ilya Petrovitch’s stare.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He can scarcely stand upright. And you...” Nikodim Fomitch was\\r\\nbeginning.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No matter,” Ilya Petrovitch pronounced rather peculiarly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNikodim Fomitch would have made some further protest, but glancing at\\r\\nthe head clerk who was looking very hard at him, he did not speak. There\\r\\nwas a sudden silence. It was strange.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very well, then,” concluded Ilya Petrovitch, “we will not detain you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov went out. He caught the sound of eager conversation on his\\r\\ndeparture, and above the rest rose the questioning voice of Nikodim\\r\\nFomitch. In the street, his faintness passed off completely.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A search--there will be a search at once,” he repeated to himself,\\r\\nhurrying home. “The brutes! they suspect.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis former terror mastered him completely again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what if there has been a search already? What if I find them in my\\r\\nroom?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut here was his room. Nothing and no one in it. No one had peeped in.\\r\\nEven Nastasya had not touched it. But heavens! how could he have left\\r\\nall those things in the hole?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under the paper, pulled the\\r\\nthings out and lined his pockets with them. There were eight articles in\\r\\nall: two little boxes with ear-rings or something of the sort, he hardly\\r\\nlooked to see; then four small leather cases. There was a chain, too,\\r\\nmerely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper, that looked\\r\\nlike a decoration.... He put them all in the different pockets of his\\r\\novercoat, and the remaining pocket of his trousers, trying to conceal\\r\\nthem as much as possible. He took the purse, too. Then he went out of\\r\\nhis room, leaving the door open. He walked quickly and resolutely, and\\r\\nthough he felt shattered, he had his senses about him. He was afraid of\\r\\npursuit, he was afraid that in another half-hour, another quarter of an\\r\\nhour perhaps, instructions would be issued for his pursuit, and so at\\r\\nall costs, he must hide all traces before then. He must clear everything\\r\\nup while he still had some strength, some reasoning power left him....\\r\\nWhere was he to go?\\r\\n\\r\\nThat had long been settled: “Fling them into the canal, and all traces\\r\\nhidden in the water, the thing would be at an end.” So he had decided in\\r\\nthe night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to\\r\\nget up and go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all. But to get\\r\\nrid of it, turned out to be a very difficult task. He wandered along\\r\\nthe bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked\\r\\nseveral times at the steps running down to the water, but he could not\\r\\nthink of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the steps’ edge,\\r\\nand women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and\\r\\npeople were swarming everywhere. Moreover he could be seen and noticed\\r\\nfrom the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to go\\r\\ndown on purpose, stop, and throw something into the water. And what if\\r\\nthe boxes were to float instead of sinking? And of course they would.\\r\\nEven as it was, everyone he met seemed to stare and look round, as if\\r\\nthey had nothing to do but to watch him. “Why is it, or can it be my\\r\\nfancy?” he thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the\\r\\nNeva. There were not so many people there, he would be less observed,\\r\\nand it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was further\\r\\noff. He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour,\\r\\nworried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it\\r\\nbefore. And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan, simply\\r\\nbecause he had thought of it in delirium! He had become extremely absent\\r\\nand forgetful and he was aware of it. He certainly must make haste.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked towards the Neva along V---- Prospect, but on the way\\r\\nanother idea struck him. “Why to the Neva? Would it not be better to go\\r\\nsomewhere far off, to the Islands again, and there hide the things\\r\\nin some solitary place, in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot\\r\\nperhaps?” And though he felt incapable of clear judgment, the idea\\r\\nseemed to him a sound one. But he was not destined to go there. For\\r\\ncoming out of V---- Prospect towards the square, he saw on the left a\\r\\npassage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard. On the right\\r\\nhand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far\\r\\ninto the court; on the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for\\r\\ntwenty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left. Here\\r\\nwas a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts was\\r\\nlying. At the end of the court, the corner of a low, smutty, stone shed,\\r\\napparently part of some workshop, peeped from behind the hoarding. It\\r\\nwas probably a carriage builder’s or carpenter’s shed; the whole place\\r\\nfrom the entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the place to\\r\\nthrow it, he thought. Not seeing anyone in the yard, he slipped in, and\\r\\nat once saw near the gate a sink, such as is often put in yards where\\r\\nthere are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had\\r\\nbeen scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, “Standing here\\r\\nstrictly forbidden.” This was all the better, for there would be nothing\\r\\nsuspicious about his going in. “Here I could throw it all in a heap and\\r\\nget away!”\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticed\\r\\nagainst the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewn\\r\\nstone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a\\r\\nstreet. He could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but he\\r\\ncould not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from the\\r\\nstreet, which might well happen indeed, so there was need of haste.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in both hands,\\r\\nand using all his strength turned it over. Under the stone was a small\\r\\nhollow in the ground, and he immediately emptied his pocket into it.\\r\\nThe purse lay at the top, and yet the hollow was not filled up. Then he\\r\\nseized the stone again and with one twist turned it back, so that it was\\r\\nin the same position again, though it stood a very little higher. But\\r\\nhe scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot.\\r\\nNothing could be noticed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he went out, and turned into the square. Again an intense,\\r\\nalmost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant, as it had in\\r\\nthe police-office. “I have buried my tracks! And who, who can think of\\r\\nlooking under that stone? It has been lying there most likely ever since\\r\\nthe house was built, and will lie as many years more. And if it were\\r\\nfound, who would think of me? It is all over! No clue!” And he laughed.\\r\\nYes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous noiseless\\r\\nlaugh, and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square. But\\r\\nwhen he reached the K---- Boulevard where two days before he had come\\r\\nupon that girl, his laughter suddenly ceased. Other ideas crept into his\\r\\nmind. He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat\\r\\non which after the girl was gone, he had sat and pondered, and that it\\r\\nwould be hateful, too, to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had\\r\\ngiven the twenty copecks: “Damn him!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly. All his ideas now\\r\\nseemed to be circling round some single point, and he felt that there\\r\\nreally was such a point, and that now, now, he was left facing that\\r\\npoint--and for the first time, indeed, during the last two months.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Damn it all!” he thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovernable fury.\\r\\n“If it has begun, then it has begun. Hang the new life! Good Lord, how\\r\\nstupid it is!... And what lies I told to-day! How despicably I fawned\\r\\nupon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I\\r\\ncare for them all, and my fawning upon them! It is not that at all! It\\r\\nis not that at all!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple\\r\\nquestion perplexed and bitterly confounded him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically, if\\r\\nI really had a certain and definite object, how is it I did not even\\r\\nglance into the purse and don’t know what I had there, for which I have\\r\\nundergone these agonies, and have deliberately undertaken this base,\\r\\nfilthy degrading business? And here I wanted at once to throw into the\\r\\nwater the purse together with all the things which I had not seen\\r\\neither... how’s that?”\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, that was so, that was all so. Yet he had known it all before, and\\r\\nit was not a new question for him, even when it was decided in the night\\r\\nwithout hesitation and consideration, as though so it must be, as though\\r\\nit could not possibly be otherwise.... Yes, he had known it all, and\\r\\nunderstood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the\\r\\nmoment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out\\r\\nof it.... Yes, so it was.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is because I am very ill,” he decided grimly at last, “I have been\\r\\nworrying and fretting myself, and I don’t know what I am doing....\\r\\nYesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been\\r\\nworrying myself.... I shall get well and I shall not worry.... But what\\r\\nif I don’t get well at all? Good God, how sick I am of it all!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing for some\\r\\ndistraction, but he did not know what to do, what to attempt. A new\\r\\noverwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him\\r\\nevery moment; this was an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for\\r\\neverything surrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred.\\r\\nAll who met him were loathsome to him--he loathed their faces, their\\r\\nmovements, their gestures. If anyone had addressed him, he felt that he\\r\\nmight have spat at him or bitten him....\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva, near\\r\\nthe bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. “Why, he lives here, in that house,”\\r\\n he thought, “why, I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord! Here\\r\\nit’s the same thing over again.... Very interesting to know, though;\\r\\nhave I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance? Never\\r\\nmind, I said the day before yesterday that I would go and see him the\\r\\nday _after_; well, and so I will! Besides I really cannot go further\\r\\nnow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went up to Razumihin’s room on the fifth floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter was at home in his garret, busily writing at the moment, and\\r\\nhe opened the door himself. It was four months since they had seen each\\r\\nother. Razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers on\\r\\nhis bare feet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed. His face showed surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it you?” he cried. He looked his comrade up and down; then after a\\r\\nbrief pause, he whistled. “As hard up as all that! Why, brother, you’ve\\r\\ncut me out!” he added, looking at Raskolnikov’s rags. “Come sit down,\\r\\nyou are tired, I’ll be bound.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he had sunk down on the American leather sofa, which was\\r\\nin even worse condition than his own, Razumihin saw at once that his\\r\\nvisitor was ill.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, you are seriously ill, do you know that?” He began feeling his\\r\\npulse. Raskolnikov pulled away his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never mind,” he said, “I have come for this: I have no lessons.... I\\r\\nwanted,... but I don’t really want lessons....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I say! You are delirious, you know!” Razumihin observed, watching\\r\\nhim carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I am not.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov got up from the sofa. As he had mounted the stairs to\\r\\nRazumihin’s, he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend\\r\\nface to face. Now, in a flash, he knew, that what he was least of all\\r\\ndisposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the\\r\\nwide world. His spleen rose within him. He almost choked with rage at\\r\\nhimself as soon as he crossed Razumihin’s threshold.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-bye,” he said abruptly, and walked to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stop, stop! You queer fish.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t want to,” said the other, again pulling away his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then why the devil have you come? Are you mad, or what? Why, this\\r\\nis... almost insulting! I won’t let you go like that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, then, I came to you because I know no one but you who could\\r\\nhelp... to begin... because you are kinder than anyone--cleverer, I\\r\\nmean, and can judge... and now I see that I want nothing. Do you hear?\\r\\nNothing at all... no one’s services... no one’s sympathy. I am by\\r\\nmyself... alone. Come, that’s enough. Leave me alone.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stay a minute, you sweep! You are a perfect madman. As you like for all\\r\\nI care. I have no lessons, do you see, and I don’t care about that, but\\r\\nthere’s a bookseller, Heruvimov--and he takes the place of a lesson.\\r\\nI would not exchange him for five lessons. He’s doing publishing of a\\r\\nkind, and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation they\\r\\nhave! The very titles are worth the money! You always maintained that I\\r\\nwas a fool, but by Jove, my boy, there are greater fools than I am!\\r\\nNow he is setting up for being advanced, not that he has an inkling of\\r\\nanything, but, of course, I encourage him. Here are two signatures of\\r\\nthe German text--in my opinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses\\r\\nthe question, ‘Is woman a human being?’ And, of course, triumphantly\\r\\nproves that she is. Heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a\\r\\ncontribution to the woman question; I am translating it; he will expand\\r\\nthese two and a half signatures into six, we shall make up a gorgeous\\r\\ntitle half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble. It will do! He\\r\\npays me six roubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles\\r\\nfor the job, and I’ve had six already in advance. When we have finished\\r\\nthis, we are going to begin a translation about whales, and then some of\\r\\nthe dullest scandals out of the second part of _Les Confessions_ we have\\r\\nmarked for translation; somebody has told Heruvimov, that Rousseau was\\r\\na kind of Radishchev. You may be sure I don’t contradict him, hang him!\\r\\nWell, would you like to do the second signature of ‘_Is woman a human\\r\\nbeing?_’ If you would, take the German and pens and paper--all those\\r\\nare provided, and take three roubles; for as I have had six roubles in\\r\\nadvance on the whole thing, three roubles come to you for your share.\\r\\nAnd when you have finished the signature there will be another three\\r\\nroubles for you. And please don’t think I am doing you a service; quite\\r\\nthe contrary, as soon as you came in, I saw how you could help me; to\\r\\nbegin with, I am weak in spelling, and secondly, I am sometimes utterly\\r\\nadrift in German, so that I make it up as I go along for the most part.\\r\\nThe only comfort is, that it’s bound to be a change for the better.\\r\\nThough who can tell, maybe it’s sometimes for the worse. Will you take\\r\\nit?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov took the German sheets in silence, took the three roubles\\r\\nand without a word went out. Razumihin gazed after him in astonishment.\\r\\nBut when Raskolnikov was in the next street, he turned back, mounted the\\r\\nstairs to Razumihin’s again and laying on the table the German article\\r\\nand the three roubles, went out again, still without uttering a word.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you raving, or what?” Razumihin shouted, roused to fury at last.\\r\\n“What farce is this? You’ll drive me crazy too... what did you come to\\r\\nsee me for, damn you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t want... translation,” muttered Raskolnikov from the stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then what the devil do you want?” shouted Razumihin from above.\\r\\nRaskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hey, there! Where are you living?”\\r\\n\\r\\nNo answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, confound you then!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Raskolnikov was already stepping into the street. On the Nikolaevsky\\r\\nBridge he was roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasant\\r\\nincident. A coachman, after shouting at him two or three times, gave him\\r\\na violent lash on the back with his whip, for having almost fallen under\\r\\nhis horses’ hoofs. The lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the\\r\\nrailing (for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middle\\r\\nof the bridge in the traffic). He angrily clenched and ground his teeth.\\r\\nHe heard laughter, of course.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Serves him right!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A pickpocket I dare say.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pretending to be drunk, for sure, and getting under the wheels on\\r\\npurpose; and you have to answer for him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a regular profession, that’s what it is.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while he stood at the railing, still looking angry and bewildered\\r\\nafter the retreating carriage, and rubbing his back, he suddenly felt\\r\\nsomeone thrust money into his hand. He looked. It was an elderly woman\\r\\nin a kerchief and goatskin shoes, with a girl, probably her daughter,\\r\\nwearing a hat, and carrying a green parasol.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Take it, my good man, in Christ’s name.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took it and they passed on. It was a piece of twenty copecks. From\\r\\nhis dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggar\\r\\nasking alms in the streets, and the gift of the twenty copecks he\\r\\ndoubtless owed to the blow, which made them feel sorry for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe closed his hand on the twenty copecks, walked on for ten paces, and\\r\\nturned facing the Neva, looking towards the palace. The sky was without\\r\\na cloud and the water was almost bright blue, which is so rare in the\\r\\nNeva. The cupola of the cathedral, which is seen at its best from the\\r\\nbridge about twenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight,\\r\\nand in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished.\\r\\nThe pain from the lash went off, and Raskolnikov forgot about it; one\\r\\nuneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely. He stood\\r\\nstill, and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was\\r\\nespecially familiar to him. When he was attending the university, he had\\r\\nhundreds of times--generally on his way home--stood still on this spot,\\r\\ngazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at\\r\\na vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him. It left him strangely\\r\\ncold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless. He wondered\\r\\nevery time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrusting\\r\\nhimself, put off finding the explanation of it. He vividly recalled\\r\\nthose old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it was\\r\\nno mere chance that he recalled them now. It struck him as strange and\\r\\ngrotesque, that he should have stopped at the same spot as before,\\r\\nas though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts, be\\r\\ninterested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him...\\r\\nso short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his\\r\\nheart. Deep down, hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him\\r\\nnow--all his old past, his old thoughts, his old problems and theories,\\r\\nhis old impressions and that picture and himself and all, all.... He\\r\\nfelt as though he were flying upwards, and everything were vanishing\\r\\nfrom his sight. Making an unconscious movement with his hand, he\\r\\nsuddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He opened his\\r\\nhand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his arm flung it into\\r\\nthe water; then he turned and went home. It seemed to him, he had cut\\r\\nhimself off from everyone and from everything at that moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvening was coming on when he reached home, so that he must have been\\r\\nwalking about six hours. How and where he came back he did not remember.\\r\\nUndressing, and quivering like an overdriven horse, he lay down on the\\r\\nsofa, drew his greatcoat over him, and at once sank into oblivion....\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream. Good God, what a\\r\\nscream! Such unnatural sounds, such howling, wailing, grinding, tears,\\r\\nblows and curses he had never heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy. In terror he\\r\\nsat up in bed, almost swooning with agony. But the fighting, wailing\\r\\nand cursing grew louder and louder. And then to his intense amazement\\r\\nhe caught the voice of his landlady. She was howling, shrieking and\\r\\nwailing, rapidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make\\r\\nout what she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, not to be\\r\\nbeaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs. The voice of\\r\\nher assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost\\r\\na croak; but he, too, was saying something, and just as quickly\\r\\nand indistinctly, hurrying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikov\\r\\ntrembled; he recognised the voice--it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch.\\r\\nIlya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady! He is kicking her,\\r\\nbanging her head against the steps--that’s clear, that can be told\\r\\nfrom the sounds, from the cries and the thuds. How is it, is the world\\r\\ntopsy-turvy? He could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys\\r\\nand all the staircases; he heard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors\\r\\nbanging. “But why, why, and how could it be?” he repeated, thinking\\r\\nseriously that he had gone mad. But no, he heard too distinctly! And\\r\\nthey would come to him then next, “for no doubt... it’s all about\\r\\nthat... about yesterday.... Good God!” He would have fastened his door\\r\\nwith the latch, but he could not lift his hand... besides, it would\\r\\nbe useless. Terror gripped his heart like ice, tortured him and numbed\\r\\nhim.... But at last all this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes,\\r\\nbegan gradually to subside. The landlady was moaning and groaning; Ilya\\r\\nPetrovitch was still uttering threats and curses.... But at last he,\\r\\ntoo, seemed to be silent, and now he could not be heard. “Can he have\\r\\ngone away? Good Lord!” Yes, and now the landlady is going too, still\\r\\nweeping and moaning... and then her door slammed.... Now the crowd was\\r\\ngoing from the stairs to their rooms, exclaiming, disputing, calling\\r\\nto one another, raising their voices to a shout, dropping them to a\\r\\nwhisper. There must have been numbers of them--almost all the inmates\\r\\nof the block. “But, good God, how could it be! And why, why had he come\\r\\nhere!”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa, but could not close his eyes. He\\r\\nlay for half an hour in such anguish, such an intolerable sensation of\\r\\ninfinite terror as he had never experienced before. Suddenly a bright\\r\\nlight flashed into his room. Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate\\r\\nof soup. Looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not\\r\\nasleep, she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she\\r\\nhad brought--bread, salt, a plate, a spoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ve eaten nothing since yesterday, I warrant. You’ve been trudging\\r\\nabout all day, and you’re shaking with fever.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nastasya... what were they beating the landlady for?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked intently at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who beat the landlady?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just now... half an hour ago, Ilya Petrovitch, the assistant\\r\\nsuperintendent, on the stairs.... Why was he ill-treating her like that,\\r\\nand... why was he here?”\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasya scrutinised him, silent and frowning, and her scrutiny lasted a\\r\\nlong time. He felt uneasy, even frightened at her searching eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nastasya, why don’t you speak?” he said timidly at last in a weak\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s the blood,” she answered at last softly, as though speaking to\\r\\nherself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Blood? What blood?” he muttered, growing white and turning towards the\\r\\nwall.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasya still looked at him without speaking.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nobody has been beating the landlady,” she declared at last in a firm,\\r\\nresolute voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gazed at her, hardly able to breathe.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I heard it myself.... I was not asleep... I was sitting up,” he\\r\\nsaid still more timidly. “I listened a long while. The assistant\\r\\nsuperintendent came.... Everyone ran out on to the stairs from all the\\r\\nflats.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No one has been here. That’s the blood crying in your ears. When\\r\\nthere’s no outlet for it and it gets clotted, you begin fancying\\r\\nthings.... Will you eat something?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no answer. Nastasya still stood over him, watching him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give me something to drink... Nastasya.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water.\\r\\nHe remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling\\r\\nsome on his neck. Then followed forgetfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not completely unconscious, however, all the time he was ill; he\\r\\nwas in a feverish state, sometimes delirious, sometimes half conscious.\\r\\nHe remembered a great deal afterwards. Sometimes it seemed as though\\r\\nthere were a number of people round him; they wanted to take him away\\r\\nsomewhere, there was a great deal of squabbling and discussing about\\r\\nhim. Then he would be alone in the room; they had all gone away afraid\\r\\nof him, and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him;\\r\\nthey threatened him, plotted something together, laughed, and mocked\\r\\nat him. He remembered Nastasya often at his bedside; he distinguished\\r\\nanother person, too, whom he seemed to know very well, though he could\\r\\nnot remember who he was, and this fretted him, even made him cry.\\r\\nSometimes he fancied he had been lying there a month; at other times\\r\\nit all seemed part of the same day. But of _that_--of _that_ he had\\r\\nno recollection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten\\r\\nsomething he ought to remember. He worried and tormented himself trying\\r\\nto remember, moaned, flew into a rage, or sank into awful, intolerable\\r\\nterror. Then he struggled to get up, would have run away, but someone\\r\\nalways prevented him by force, and he sank back into impotence and\\r\\nforgetfulness. At last he returned to complete consciousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened at ten o’clock in the morning. On fine days the sun shone\\r\\ninto the room at that hour, throwing a streak of light on the right\\r\\nwall and the corner near the door. Nastasya was standing beside him\\r\\nwith another person, a complete stranger, who was looking at him\\r\\nvery inquisitively. He was a young man with a beard, wearing a full,\\r\\nshort-waisted coat, and looked like a messenger. The landlady was\\r\\npeeping in at the half-opened door. Raskolnikov sat up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who is this, Nastasya?” he asked, pointing to the young man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say, he’s himself again!” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is himself,” echoed the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nConcluding that he had returned to his senses, the landlady closed the\\r\\ndoor and disappeared. She was always shy and dreaded conversations or\\r\\ndiscussions. She was a woman of forty, not at all bad-looking, fat\\r\\nand buxom, with black eyes and eyebrows, good-natured from fatness and\\r\\nlaziness, and absurdly bashful.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who... are you?” he went on, addressing the man. But at that moment\\r\\nthe door was flung open, and, stooping a little, as he was so tall,\\r\\nRazumihin came in.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a cabin it is!” he cried. “I am always knocking my head. You call\\r\\nthis a lodging! So you are conscious, brother? I’ve just heard the news\\r\\nfrom Pashenka.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has just come to,” said Nastasya.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just come to,” echoed the man again, with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And who are you?” Razumihin asked, suddenly addressing him. “My name is\\r\\nVrazumihin, at your service; not Razumihin, as I am always called, but\\r\\nVrazumihin, a student and gentleman; and he is my friend. And who are\\r\\nyou?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am the messenger from our office, from the merchant Shelopaev, and\\r\\nI’ve come on business.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Please sit down.” Razumihin seated himself on the other side of the\\r\\ntable. “It’s a good thing you’ve come to, brother,” he went on to\\r\\nRaskolnikov. “For the last four days you have scarcely eaten or drunk\\r\\nanything. We had to give you tea in spoonfuls. I brought Zossimov to see\\r\\nyou twice. You remember Zossimov? He examined you carefully and said at\\r\\nonce it was nothing serious--something seemed to have gone to your head.\\r\\nSome nervous nonsense, the result of bad feeding, he says you have not\\r\\nhad enough beer and radish, but it’s nothing much, it will pass and you\\r\\nwill be all right. Zossimov is a first-rate fellow! He is making quite a\\r\\nname. Come, I won’t keep you,” he said, addressing the man again. “Will\\r\\nyou explain what you want? You must know, Rodya, this is the second time\\r\\nthey have sent from the office; but it was another man last time, and I\\r\\ntalked to him. Who was it came before?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was the day before yesterday, I venture to say, if you please,\\r\\nsir. That was Alexey Semyonovitch; he is in our office, too.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He was more intelligent than you, don’t you think so?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, indeed, sir, he is of more weight than I am.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so; go on.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“At your mamma’s request, through Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin, of whom\\r\\nI presume you have heard more than once, a remittance is sent to you\\r\\nfrom our office,” the man began, addressing Raskolnikov. “If you are in\\r\\nan intelligible condition, I’ve thirty-five roubles to remit to you, as\\r\\nSemyon Semyonovitch has received from Afanasy Ivanovitch at your mamma’s\\r\\nrequest instructions to that effect, as on previous occasions. Do you\\r\\nknow him, sir?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I remember... Vahrushin,” Raskolnikov said dreamily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You hear, he knows Vahrushin,” cried Razumihin. “He is in ‘an\\r\\nintelligible condition’! And I see you are an intelligent man too. Well,\\r\\nit’s always pleasant to hear words of wisdom.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s the gentleman, Vahrushin, Afanasy Ivanovitch. And at the request\\r\\nof your mamma, who has sent you a remittance once before in the\\r\\nsame manner through him, he did not refuse this time also, and sent\\r\\ninstructions to Semyon Semyonovitch some days since to hand you\\r\\nthirty-five roubles in the hope of better to come.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That ‘hoping for better to come’ is the best thing you’ve said, though\\r\\n‘your mamma’ is not bad either. Come then, what do you say? Is he fully\\r\\nconscious, eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s all right. If only he can sign this little paper.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He can scrawl his name. Have you got the book?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, here’s the book.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give it to me. Here, Rodya, sit up. I’ll hold you. Take the pen and\\r\\nscribble ‘Raskolnikov’ for him. For just now, brother, money is sweeter\\r\\nto us than treacle.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t want it,” said Raskolnikov, pushing away the pen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not want it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I won’t sign it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How the devil can you do without signing it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t want... the money.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t want the money! Come, brother, that’s nonsense, I bear witness.\\r\\nDon’t trouble, please, it’s only that he is on his travels again. But\\r\\nthat’s pretty common with him at all times though.... You are a man of\\r\\njudgment and we will take him in hand, that is, more simply, take his\\r\\nhand and he will sign it. Here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I can come another time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no. Why should we trouble you? You are a man of judgment.... Now,\\r\\nRodya, don’t keep your visitor, you see he is waiting,” and he made\\r\\nready to hold Raskolnikov’s hand in earnest.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stop, I’ll do it alone,” said the latter, taking the pen and signing\\r\\nhis name.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe messenger took out the money and went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Bravo! And now, brother, are you hungry?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” answered Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is there any soup?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Some of yesterday’s,” answered Nastasya, who was still standing there.\\r\\n\\r\\n“With potatoes and rice in it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know it by heart. Bring soup and give us some tea.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very well.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull,\\r\\nunreasoning terror. He made up his mind to keep quiet and see what\\r\\nwould happen. “I believe I am not wandering. I believe it’s reality,” he\\r\\nthought.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a couple of minutes Nastasya returned with the soup, and announced\\r\\nthat the tea would be ready directly. With the soup she brought two\\r\\nspoons, two plates, salt, pepper, mustard for the beef, and so on. The\\r\\ntable was set as it had not been for a long time. The cloth was clean.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It would not be amiss, Nastasya, if Praskovya Pavlovna were to send us\\r\\nup a couple of bottles of beer. We could empty them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you are a cool hand,” muttered Nastasya, and she departed to\\r\\ncarry out his orders.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention. Meanwhile\\r\\nRazumihin sat down on the sofa beside him, as clumsily as a bear put his\\r\\nleft arm round Raskolnikov’s head, although he was able to sit up, and\\r\\nwith his right hand gave him a spoonful of soup, blowing on it that\\r\\nit might not burn him. But the soup was only just warm. Raskolnikov\\r\\nswallowed one spoonful greedily, then a second, then a third. But after\\r\\ngiving him a few more spoonfuls of soup, Razumihin suddenly stopped, and\\r\\nsaid that he must ask Zossimov whether he ought to have more.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasya came in with two bottles of beer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And will you have tea?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Cut along, Nastasya, and bring some tea, for tea we may venture on\\r\\nwithout the faculty. But here is the beer!” He moved back to his chair,\\r\\npulled the soup and meat in front of him, and began eating as though he\\r\\nhad not touched food for three days.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must tell you, Rodya, I dine like this here every day now,” he\\r\\nmumbled with his mouth full of beef, “and it’s all Pashenka, your dear\\r\\nlittle landlady, who sees to that; she loves to do anything for me. I\\r\\ndon’t ask for it, but, of course, I don’t object. And here’s Nastasya\\r\\nwith the tea. She is a quick girl. Nastasya, my dear, won’t you have\\r\\nsome beer?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get along with your nonsense!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A cup of tea, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A cup of tea, maybe.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pour it out. Stay, I’ll pour it out myself. Sit down.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe poured out two cups, left his dinner, and sat on the sofa again. As\\r\\nbefore, he put his left arm round the sick man’s head, raised him up\\r\\nand gave him tea in spoonfuls, again blowing each spoonful steadily and\\r\\nearnestly, as though this process was the principal and most effective\\r\\nmeans towards his friend’s recovery. Raskolnikov said nothing and made\\r\\nno resistance, though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa\\r\\nwithout support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon, but\\r\\neven perhaps could have walked about. But from some queer, almost\\r\\nanimal, cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lying\\r\\nlow for a time, pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession\\r\\nof his faculties, and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on.\\r\\nYet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance. After sipping a dozen\\r\\nspoonfuls of tea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the spoon away\\r\\ncapriciously, and sank back on the pillow. There were actually real\\r\\npillows under his head now, down pillows in clean cases, he observed\\r\\nthat, too, and took note of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pashenka must give us some raspberry jam to-day to make him some\\r\\nraspberry tea,” said Razumihin, going back to his chair and attacking\\r\\nhis soup and beer again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And where is she to get raspberries for you?” asked Nastasya, balancing\\r\\na saucer on her five outspread fingers and sipping tea through a lump of\\r\\nsugar.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She’ll get it at the shop, my dear. You see, Rodya, all sorts of things\\r\\nhave been happening while you have been laid up. When you decamped in\\r\\nthat rascally way without leaving your address, I felt so angry that I\\r\\nresolved to find you out and punish you. I set to work that very day.\\r\\nHow I ran about making inquiries for you! This lodging of yours I had\\r\\nforgotten, though I never remembered it, indeed, because I did not know\\r\\nit; and as for your old lodgings, I could only remember it was at the\\r\\nFive Corners, Harlamov’s house. I kept trying to find that Harlamov’s\\r\\nhouse, and afterwards it turned out that it was not Harlamov’s, but\\r\\nBuch’s. How one muddles up sound sometimes! So I lost my temper, and I\\r\\nwent on the chance to the address bureau next day, and only fancy, in\\r\\ntwo minutes they looked you up! Your name is down there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My name!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should think so; and yet a General Kobelev they could not find while\\r\\nI was there. Well, it’s a long story. But as soon as I did land on this\\r\\nplace, I soon got to know all your affairs--all, all, brother, I know\\r\\neverything; Nastasya here will tell you. I made the acquaintance of\\r\\nNikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, and the house-porter and Mr.\\r\\nZametov, Alexandr Grigorievitch, the head clerk in the police office,\\r\\nand, last, but not least, of Pashenka; Nastasya here knows....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s got round her,” Nastasya murmured, smiling slyly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why don’t you put the sugar in your tea, Nastasya Nikiforovna?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a one!” Nastasya cried suddenly, going off into a giggle. “I am\\r\\nnot Nikiforovna, but Petrovna,” she added suddenly, recovering from her\\r\\nmirth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll make a note of it. Well, brother, to make a long story short,\\r\\nI was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant\\r\\ninfluences in the locality, but Pashenka won the day. I had not\\r\\nexpected, brother, to find her so... prepossessing. Eh, what do you\\r\\nthink?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov did not speak, but he still kept his eyes fixed upon him,\\r\\nfull of alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And all that could be wished, indeed, in every respect,” Razumihin went\\r\\non, not at all embarrassed by his silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, the sly dog!” Nastasya shrieked again. This conversation afforded\\r\\nher unspeakable delight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a pity, brother, that you did not set to work in the right way\\r\\nat first. You ought to have approached her differently. She is, so\\r\\nto speak, a most unaccountable character. But we will talk about her\\r\\ncharacter later.... How could you let things come to such a pass that\\r\\nshe gave up sending you your dinner? And that I O U? You must have been\\r\\nmad to sign an I O U. And that promise of marriage when her daughter,\\r\\nNatalya Yegorovna, was alive?... I know all about it! But I see that’s\\r\\na delicate matter and I am an ass; forgive me. But, talking of\\r\\nfoolishness, do you know Praskovya Pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as\\r\\nyou would think at first sight?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” mumbled Raskolnikov, looking away, but feeling that it was better\\r\\nto keep up the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She isn’t, is she?” cried Razumihin, delighted to get an answer out\\r\\nof him. “But she is not very clever either, eh? She is essentially,\\r\\nessentially an unaccountable character! I am sometimes quite at a loss,\\r\\nI assure you.... She must be forty; she says she is thirty-six, and\\r\\nof course she has every right to say so. But I swear I judge her\\r\\nintellectually, simply from the metaphysical point of view; there is a\\r\\nsort of symbolism sprung up between us, a sort of algebra or what not!\\r\\nI don’t understand it! Well, that’s all nonsense. Only, seeing that you\\r\\nare not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes, and\\r\\nthat through the young lady’s death she has no need to treat you as\\r\\na relation, she suddenly took fright; and as you hid in your den and\\r\\ndropped all your old relations with her, she planned to get rid of you.\\r\\nAnd she’s been cherishing that design a long time, but was sorry to lose\\r\\nthe I O U, for you assured her yourself that your mother would pay.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was base of me to say that.... My mother herself is almost\\r\\na beggar... and I told a lie to keep my lodging... and be fed,”\\r\\n Raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, you did very sensibly. But the worst of it is that at that point\\r\\nMr. Tchebarov turns up, a business man. Pashenka would never have\\r\\nthought of doing anything on her own account, she is too retiring; but\\r\\nthe business man is by no means retiring, and first thing he puts the\\r\\nquestion, ‘Is there any hope of realising the I O U?’ Answer: there is,\\r\\nbecause he has a mother who would save her Rodya with her hundred and\\r\\ntwenty-five roubles pension, if she has to starve herself; and a sister,\\r\\ntoo, who would go into bondage for his sake. That’s what he was building\\r\\nupon.... Why do you start? I know all the ins and outs of your affairs\\r\\nnow, my dear boy--it’s not for nothing that you were so open with\\r\\nPashenka when you were her prospective son-in-law, and I say all this as\\r\\na friend.... But I tell you what it is; an honest and sensitive man is\\r\\nopen; and a business man ‘listens and goes on eating’ you up. Well,\\r\\nthen she gave the I O U by way of payment to this Tchebarov, and without\\r\\nhesitation he made a formal demand for payment. When I heard of all this\\r\\nI wanted to blow him up, too, to clear my conscience, but by that time\\r\\nharmony reigned between me and Pashenka, and I insisted on stopping\\r\\nthe whole affair, engaging that you would pay. I went security for you,\\r\\nbrother. Do you understand? We called Tchebarov, flung him ten\\r\\nroubles and got the I O U back from him, and here I have the honour of\\r\\npresenting it to you. She trusts your word now. Here, take it, you see I\\r\\nhave torn it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRazumihin put the note on the table. Raskolnikov looked at him and\\r\\nturned to the wall without uttering a word. Even Razumihin felt a\\r\\ntwinge.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see, brother,” he said a moment later, “that I have been playing the\\r\\nfool again. I thought I should amuse you with my chatter, and I believe\\r\\nI have only made you cross.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was it you I did not recognise when I was delirious?” Raskolnikov\\r\\nasked, after a moment’s pause without turning his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, and you flew into a rage about it, especially when I brought\\r\\nZametov one day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Zametov? The head clerk? What for?” Raskolnikov turned round quickly\\r\\nand fixed his eyes on Razumihin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s the matter with you?... What are you upset about? He wanted to\\r\\nmake your acquaintance because I talked to him a lot about you.... How\\r\\ncould I have found out so much except from him? He is a capital\\r\\nfellow, brother, first-rate... in his own way, of course. Now we are\\r\\nfriends--see each other almost every day. I have moved into this part,\\r\\nyou know. I have only just moved. I’ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna\\r\\nonce or twice.... Do you remember Luise, Luise Ivanovna?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did I say anything in delirium?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should think so! You were beside yourself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did I rave about?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What next? What did you rave about? What people do rave about.... Well,\\r\\nbrother, now I must not lose time. To work.” He got up from the table\\r\\nand took up his cap.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did I rave about?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How he keeps on! Are you afraid of having let out some secret? Don’t\\r\\nworry yourself; you said nothing about a countess. But you said a lot\\r\\nabout a bulldog, and about ear-rings and chains, and about Krestovsky\\r\\nIsland, and some porter, and Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, the\\r\\nassistant superintendent. And another thing that was of special interest\\r\\nto you was your own sock. You whined, ‘Give me my sock.’ Zametov\\r\\nhunted all about your room for your socks, and with his own scented,\\r\\nring-bedecked fingers he gave you the rag. And only then were you\\r\\ncomforted, and for the next twenty-four hours you held the wretched\\r\\nthing in your hand; we could not get it from you. It is most likely\\r\\nsomewhere under your quilt at this moment. And then you asked so\\r\\npiteously for fringe for your trousers. We tried to find out what sort\\r\\nof fringe, but we could not make it out. Now to business! Here are\\r\\nthirty-five roubles; I take ten of them, and shall give you an account\\r\\nof them in an hour or two. I will let Zossimov know at the same time,\\r\\nthough he ought to have been here long ago, for it is nearly twelve. And\\r\\nyou, Nastasya, look in pretty often while I am away, to see whether he\\r\\nwants a drink or anything else. And I will tell Pashenka what is wanted\\r\\nmyself. Good-bye!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He calls her Pashenka! Ah, he’s a deep one!” said Nastasya as he went\\r\\nout; then she opened the door and stood listening, but could not resist\\r\\nrunning downstairs after him. She was very eager to hear what he would\\r\\nsay to the landlady. She was evidently quite fascinated by Razumihin.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sooner had she left the room than the sick man flung off the\\r\\nbedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman. With burning, twitching\\r\\nimpatience he had waited for them to be gone so that he might set to\\r\\nwork. But to what work? Now, as though to spite him, it eluded him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good God, only tell me one thing: do they know of it yet or not? What\\r\\nif they know it and are only pretending, mocking me while I am laid up,\\r\\nand then they will come in and tell me that it’s been discovered long\\r\\nago and that they have only... What am I to do now? That’s what I’ve\\r\\nforgotten, as though on purpose; forgotten it all at once, I remembered\\r\\na minute ago.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewilderment\\r\\nabout him; he walked to the door, opened it, listened; but that was not\\r\\nwhat he wanted. Suddenly, as though recalling something, he rushed to\\r\\nthe corner where there was a hole under the paper, began examining it,\\r\\nput his hand into the hole, fumbled--but that was not it. He went to the\\r\\nstove, opened it and began rummaging in the ashes; the frayed edges of\\r\\nhis trousers and the rags cut off his pocket were lying there just as\\r\\nhe had thrown them. No one had looked, then! Then he remembered the sock\\r\\nabout which Razumihin had just been telling him. Yes, there it lay on\\r\\nthe sofa under the quilt, but it was so covered with dust and grime that\\r\\nZametov could not have seen anything on it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Bah, Zametov! The police office! And why am I sent for to the police\\r\\noffice? Where’s the notice? Bah! I am mixing it up; that was then. I\\r\\nlooked at my sock then, too, but now... now I have been ill. But\\r\\nwhat did Zametov come for? Why did Razumihin bring him?” he muttered,\\r\\nhelplessly sitting on the sofa again. “What does it mean? Am I still in\\r\\ndelirium, or is it real? I believe it is real.... Ah, I remember; I must\\r\\nescape! Make haste to escape. Yes, I must, I must escape! Yes... but\\r\\nwhere? And where are my clothes? I’ve no boots. They’ve taken them away!\\r\\nThey’ve hidden them! I understand! Ah, here is my coat--they passed that\\r\\nover! And here is money on the table, thank God! And here’s the I O U...\\r\\nI’ll take the money and go and take another lodging. They won’t find\\r\\nme!... Yes, but the address bureau? They’ll find me, Razumihin will find\\r\\nme. Better escape altogether... far away... to America, and let them\\r\\ndo their worst! And take the I O U... it would be of use there.... What\\r\\nelse shall I take? They think I am ill! They don’t know that I can walk,\\r\\nha-ha-ha! I could see by their eyes that they know all about it! If\\r\\nonly I could get downstairs! And what if they have set a watch\\r\\nthere--policemen! What’s this tea? Ah, and here is beer left, half a\\r\\nbottle, cold!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe snatched up the bottle, which still contained a glassful of beer, and\\r\\ngulped it down with relish, as though quenching a flame in his breast.\\r\\nBut in another minute the beer had gone to his head, and a faint and\\r\\neven pleasant shiver ran down his spine. He lay down and pulled the\\r\\nquilt over him. His sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and more\\r\\ndisconnected, and soon a light, pleasant drowsiness came upon him. With\\r\\na sense of comfort he nestled his head into the pillow, wrapped more\\r\\nclosely about him the soft, wadded quilt which had replaced the old,\\r\\nragged greatcoat, sighed softly and sank into a deep, sound, refreshing\\r\\nsleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe woke up, hearing someone come in. He opened his eyes and saw\\r\\nRazumihin standing in the doorway, uncertain whether to come in or\\r\\nnot. Raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him, as though\\r\\ntrying to recall something.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, you are not asleep! Here I am! Nastasya, bring in the parcel!”\\r\\n Razumihin shouted down the stairs. “You shall have the account\\r\\ndirectly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What time is it?” asked Raskolnikov, looking round uneasily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, you had a fine sleep, brother, it’s almost evening, it will be six\\r\\no’clock directly. You have slept more than six hours.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens! Have I?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And why not? It will do you good. What’s the hurry? A tryst, is it?\\r\\nWe’ve all time before us. I’ve been waiting for the last three hours for\\r\\nyou; I’ve been up twice and found you asleep. I’ve called on Zossimov\\r\\ntwice; not at home, only fancy! But no matter, he will turn up. And\\r\\nI’ve been out on my own business, too. You know I’ve been moving to-day,\\r\\nmoving with my uncle. I have an uncle living with me now. But that’s\\r\\nno matter, to business. Give me the parcel, Nastasya. We will open it\\r\\ndirectly. And how do you feel now, brother?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am quite well, I am not ill. Razumihin, have you been here long?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I tell you I’ve been waiting for the last three hours.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, before.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How long have you been coming here?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why I told you all about it this morning. Don’t you remember?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov pondered. The morning seemed like a dream to him. He could\\r\\nnot remember alone, and looked inquiringly at Razumihin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hm!” said the latter, “he has forgotten. I fancied then that you were\\r\\nnot quite yourself. Now you are better for your sleep.... You really\\r\\nlook much better. First-rate! Well, to business. Look here, my dear\\r\\nboy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began untying the bundle, which evidently interested him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Believe me, brother, this is something specially near my heart. For we\\r\\nmust make a man of you. Let’s begin from the top. Do you see this\\r\\ncap?” he said, taking out of the bundle a fairly good though cheap and\\r\\nordinary cap. “Let me try it on.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Presently, afterwards,” said Raskolnikov, waving it off pettishly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, Rodya, my boy, don’t oppose it, afterwards will be too late; and\\r\\nI shan’t sleep all night, for I bought it by guess, without measure.\\r\\nJust right!” he cried triumphantly, fitting it on, “just your size! A\\r\\nproper head-covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in\\r\\nits own way. Tolstyakov, a friend of mine, is always obliged to take off\\r\\nhis pudding basin when he goes into any public place where other\\r\\npeople wear their hats or caps. People think he does it from slavish\\r\\npoliteness, but it’s simply because he is ashamed of his bird’s nest;\\r\\nhe is such a boastful fellow! Look, Nastasya, here are two specimens of\\r\\nheadgear: this Palmerston”--he took from the corner Raskolnikov’s old,\\r\\nbattered hat, which for some unknown reason, he called a Palmerston--“or\\r\\nthis jewel! Guess the price, Rodya, what do you suppose I paid for it,\\r\\nNastasya!” he said, turning to her, seeing that Raskolnikov did not\\r\\nspeak.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Twenty copecks, no more, I dare say,” answered Nastasya.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Twenty copecks, silly!” he cried, offended. “Why, nowadays you would\\r\\ncost more than that--eighty copecks! And that only because it has been\\r\\nworn. And it’s bought on condition that when’s it’s worn out, they will\\r\\ngive you another next year. Yes, on my word! Well, now let us pass to\\r\\nthe United States of America, as they called them at school. I assure\\r\\nyou I am proud of these breeches,” and he exhibited to Raskolnikov a\\r\\npair of light, summer trousers of grey woollen material. “No holes, no\\r\\nspots, and quite respectable, although a little worn; and a waistcoat\\r\\nto match, quite in the fashion. And its being worn really is an\\r\\nimprovement, it’s softer, smoother.... You see, Rodya, to my thinking,\\r\\nthe great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the\\r\\nseasons; if you don’t insist on having asparagus in January, you keep\\r\\nyour money in your purse; and it’s the same with this purchase. It’s\\r\\nsummer now, so I’ve been buying summer things--warmer materials will be\\r\\nwanted for autumn, so you will have to throw these away in any case...\\r\\nespecially as they will be done for by then from their own lack of\\r\\ncoherence if not your higher standard of luxury. Come, price them! What\\r\\ndo you say? Two roubles twenty-five copecks! And remember the condition:\\r\\nif you wear these out, you will have another suit for nothing! They only\\r\\ndo business on that system at Fedyaev’s; if you’ve bought a thing once,\\r\\nyou are satisfied for life, for you will never go there again of your\\r\\nown free will. Now for the boots. What do you say? You see that they are\\r\\na bit worn, but they’ll last a couple of months, for it’s foreign work\\r\\nand foreign leather; the secretary of the English Embassy sold them last\\r\\nweek--he had only worn them six days, but he was very short of cash.\\r\\nPrice--a rouble and a half. A bargain?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But perhaps they won’t fit,” observed Nastasya.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not fit? Just look!” and he pulled out of his pocket Raskolnikov’s\\r\\nold, broken boot, stiffly coated with dry mud. “I did not go\\r\\nempty-handed--they took the size from this monster. We all did our best.\\r\\nAnd as to your linen, your landlady has seen to that. Here, to begin\\r\\nwith are three shirts, hempen but with a fashionable front.... Well\\r\\nnow then, eighty copecks the cap, two roubles twenty-five copecks the\\r\\nsuit--together three roubles five copecks--a rouble and a half for the\\r\\nboots--for, you see, they are very good--and that makes four roubles\\r\\nfifty-five copecks; five roubles for the underclothes--they were\\r\\nbought in the lot--which makes exactly nine roubles fifty-five copecks.\\r\\nForty-five copecks change in coppers. Will you take it? And so, Rodya,\\r\\nyou are set up with a complete new rig-out, for your overcoat will\\r\\nserve, and even has a style of its own. That comes from getting one’s\\r\\nclothes from Sharmer’s! As for your socks and other things, I leave them\\r\\nto you; we’ve twenty-five roubles left. And as for Pashenka and paying\\r\\nfor your lodging, don’t you worry. I tell you she’ll trust you for\\r\\nanything. And now, brother, let me change your linen, for I daresay you\\r\\nwill throw off your illness with your shirt.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me be! I don’t want to!” Raskolnikov waved him off. He had listened\\r\\nwith disgust to Razumihin’s efforts to be playful about his purchases.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, brother, don’t tell me I’ve been trudging around for nothing,”\\r\\n Razumihin insisted. “Nastasya, don’t be bashful, but help me--that’s\\r\\nit,” and in spite of Raskolnikov’s resistance he changed his linen. The\\r\\nlatter sank back on the pillows and for a minute or two said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It will be long before I get rid of them,” he thought. “What money was\\r\\nall that bought with?” he asked at last, gazing at the wall.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Money? Why, your own, what the messenger brought from Vahrushin, your\\r\\nmother sent it. Have you forgotten that, too?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I remember now,” said Raskolnikov after a long, sullen silence.\\r\\nRazumihin looked at him, frowning and uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door opened and a tall, stout man whose appearance seemed familiar\\r\\nto Raskolnikov came in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nZossimov was a tall, fat man with a puffy, colourless, clean-shaven face\\r\\nand straight flaxen hair. He wore spectacles, and a big gold ring on\\r\\nhis fat finger. He was twenty-seven. He had on a light grey fashionable\\r\\nloose coat, light summer trousers, and everything about him loose,\\r\\nfashionable and spick and span; his linen was irreproachable, his\\r\\nwatch-chain was massive. In manner he was slow and, as it were,\\r\\nnonchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; he made\\r\\nefforts to conceal his self-importance, but it was apparent at every\\r\\ninstant. All his acquaintances found him tedious, but said he was clever\\r\\nat his work.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve been to you twice to-day, brother. You see, he’s come to himself,”\\r\\n cried Razumihin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see, I see; and how do we feel now, eh?” said Zossimov to\\r\\nRaskolnikov, watching him carefully and, sitting down at the foot of the\\r\\nsofa, he settled himself as comfortably as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is still depressed,” Razumihin went on. “We’ve just changed his\\r\\nlinen and he almost cried.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s very natural; you might have put it off if he did not wish\\r\\nit.... His pulse is first-rate. Is your head still aching, eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am well, I am perfectly well!” Raskolnikov declared positively\\r\\nand irritably. He raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with\\r\\nglittering eyes, but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to\\r\\nthe wall. Zossimov watched him intently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good.... Going on all right,” he said lazily. “Has he eaten\\r\\nanything?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey told him, and asked what he might have.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He may have anything... soup, tea... mushrooms and cucumbers, of\\r\\ncourse, you must not give him; he’d better not have meat either, and...\\r\\nbut no need to tell you that!” Razumihin and he looked at each\\r\\nother. “No more medicine or anything. I’ll look at him again to-morrow.\\r\\nPerhaps, to-day even... but never mind...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To-morrow evening I shall take him for a walk,” said Razumihin. “We are\\r\\ngoing to the Yusupov garden and then to the Palais de Cristal.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I would not disturb him to-morrow at all, but I don’t know... a little,\\r\\nmaybe... but we’ll see.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ach, what a nuisance! I’ve got a house-warming party to-night; it’s\\r\\nonly a step from here. Couldn’t he come? He could lie on the sofa. You\\r\\nare coming?” Razumihin said to Zossimov. “Don’t forget, you promised.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right, only rather later. What are you going to do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, nothing--tea, vodka, herrings. There will be a pie... just our\\r\\nfriends.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And who?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All neighbours here, almost all new friends, except my old uncle, and\\r\\nhe is new too--he only arrived in Petersburg yesterday to see to some\\r\\nbusiness of his. We meet once in five years.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is he?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s been stagnating all his life as a district postmaster; gets a\\r\\nlittle pension. He is sixty-five--not worth talking about.... But I\\r\\nam fond of him. Porfiry Petrovitch, the head of the Investigation\\r\\nDepartment here... But you know him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is he a relation of yours, too?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A very distant one. But why are you scowling? Because you quarrelled\\r\\nonce, won’t you come then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t care a damn for him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So much the better. Well, there will be some students, a teacher, a\\r\\ngovernment clerk, a musician, an officer and Zametov.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do tell me, please, what you or he”--Zossimov nodded at\\r\\nRaskolnikov--“can have in common with this Zametov?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you particular gentleman! Principles! You are worked by principles,\\r\\nas it were by springs; you won’t venture to turn round on your own\\r\\naccount. If a man is a nice fellow, that’s the only principle I go upon.\\r\\nZametov is a delightful person.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Though he does take bribes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, he does! and what of it? I don’t care if he does take bribes,”\\r\\n Razumihin cried with unnatural irritability. “I don’t praise him for\\r\\ntaking bribes. I only say he is a nice man in his own way! But if one\\r\\nlooks at men in all ways--are there many good ones left? Why, I am sure\\r\\nI shouldn’t be worth a baked onion myself... perhaps with you thrown\\r\\nin.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s too little; I’d give two for you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And I wouldn’t give more than one for you. No more of your jokes!\\r\\nZametov is no more than a boy. I can pull his hair and one must draw him\\r\\nnot repel him. You’ll never improve a man by repelling him, especially\\r\\na boy. One has to be twice as careful with a boy. Oh, you progressive\\r\\ndullards! You don’t understand. You harm yourselves running another man\\r\\ndown.... But if you want to know, we really have something in common.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should like to know what.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, it’s all about a house-painter.... We are getting him out of\\r\\na mess! Though indeed there’s nothing to fear now. The matter is\\r\\nabsolutely self-evident. We only put on steam.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A painter?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, haven’t I told you about it? I only told you the beginning then\\r\\nabout the murder of the old pawnbroker-woman. Well, the painter is mixed\\r\\nup in it...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I heard about that murder before and was rather interested in it...\\r\\npartly... for one reason.... I read about it in the papers, too....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lizaveta was murdered, too,” Nastasya blurted out, suddenly addressing\\r\\nRaskolnikov. She remained in the room all the time, standing by the door\\r\\nlistening.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lizaveta,” murmured Raskolnikov hardly audibly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lizaveta, who sold old clothes. Didn’t you know her? She used to come\\r\\nhere. She mended a shirt for you, too.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty, yellow paper he\\r\\npicked out one clumsy, white flower with brown lines on it and began\\r\\nexamining how many petals there were in it, how many scallops in the\\r\\npetals and how many lines on them. He felt his arms and legs as lifeless\\r\\nas though they had been cut off. He did not attempt to move, but stared\\r\\nobstinately at the flower.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what about the painter?” Zossimov interrupted Nastasya’s chatter\\r\\nwith marked displeasure. She sighed and was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, he was accused of the murder,” Razumihin went on hotly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was there evidence against him then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Evidence, indeed! Evidence that was no evidence, and that’s what we\\r\\nhave to prove. It was just as they pitched on those fellows, Koch and\\r\\nPestryakov, at first. Foo! how stupidly it’s all done, it makes one\\r\\nsick, though it’s not one’s business! Pestryakov may be coming\\r\\nto-night.... By the way, Rodya, you’ve heard about the business already;\\r\\nit happened before you were ill, the day before you fainted at the\\r\\npolice office while they were talking about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nZossimov looked curiously at Raskolnikov. He did not stir.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I say, Razumihin, I wonder at you. What a busybody you are!”\\r\\n Zossimov observed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Maybe I am, but we will get him off anyway,” shouted Razumihin,\\r\\nbringing his fist down on the table. “What’s the most offensive is not\\r\\ntheir lying--one can always forgive lying--lying is a delightful thing,\\r\\nfor it leads to truth--what is offensive is that they lie and worship\\r\\ntheir own lying.... I respect Porfiry, but... What threw them out at\\r\\nfirst? The door was locked, and when they came back with the porter\\r\\nit was open. So it followed that Koch and Pestryakov were the\\r\\nmurderers--that was their logic!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But don’t excite yourself; they simply detained them, they could not\\r\\nhelp that.... And, by the way, I’ve met that man Koch. He used to buy\\r\\nunredeemed pledges from the old woman? Eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, he is a swindler. He buys up bad debts, too. He makes a profession\\r\\nof it. But enough of him! Do you know what makes me angry? It’s their\\r\\nsickening rotten, petrified routine.... And this case might be the means\\r\\nof introducing a new method. One can show from the psychological data\\r\\nalone how to get on the track of the real man. ‘We have facts,’ they\\r\\nsay. But facts are not everything--at least half the business lies in\\r\\nhow you interpret them!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can you interpret them, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anyway, one can’t hold one’s tongue when one has a feeling, a tangible\\r\\nfeeling, that one might be a help if only.... Eh! Do you know the\\r\\ndetails of the case?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am waiting to hear about the painter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes! Well, here’s the story. Early on the third day after the\\r\\nmurder, when they were still dandling Koch and Pestryakov--though they\\r\\naccounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff--an\\r\\nunexpected fact turned up. A peasant called Dushkin, who keeps a\\r\\ndram-shop facing the house, brought to the police office a jeweller’s\\r\\ncase containing some gold ear-rings, and told a long rigamarole. ‘The\\r\\nday before yesterday, just after eight o’clock’--mark the day and the\\r\\nhour!--‘a journeyman house-painter, Nikolay, who had been in to see me\\r\\nalready that day, brought me this box of gold ear-rings and stones, and\\r\\nasked me to give him two roubles for them. When I asked him where he got\\r\\nthem, he said that he picked them up in the street. I did not ask him\\r\\nanything more.’ I am telling you Dushkin’s story. ‘I gave him a note’--a\\r\\nrouble that is--‘for I thought if he did not pawn it with me he would\\r\\nwith another. It would all come to the same thing--he’d spend it on\\r\\ndrink, so the thing had better be with me. The further you hide it\\r\\nthe quicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear any\\r\\nrumours, I’ll take it to the police.’ Of course, that’s all taradiddle;\\r\\nhe lies like a horse, for I know this Dushkin, he is a pawnbroker and\\r\\na receiver of stolen goods, and he did not cheat Nikolay out of a\\r\\nthirty-rouble trinket in order to give it to the police. He was simply\\r\\nafraid. But no matter, to return to Dushkin’s story. ‘I’ve known\\r\\nthis peasant, Nikolay Dementyev, from a child; he comes from the same\\r\\nprovince and district of Zaraïsk, we are both Ryazan men. And though\\r\\nNikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and I knew he had a job in that\\r\\nhouse, painting work with Dmitri, who comes from the same village, too.\\r\\nAs soon as he got the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses,\\r\\ntook his change and went out. But I did not see Dmitri with him then.\\r\\nAnd the next day I heard that someone had murdered Alyona Ivanovna and\\r\\nher sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with an axe. I knew them, and I felt\\r\\nsuspicious about the ear-rings at once, for I knew the murdered woman\\r\\nlent money on pledges. I went to the house, and began to make careful\\r\\ninquiries without saying a word to anyone. First of all I asked, “Is\\r\\nNikolay here?” Dmitri told me that Nikolay had gone off on the spree; he\\r\\nhad come home at daybreak drunk, stayed in the house about ten minutes,\\r\\nand went out again. Dmitri didn’t see him again and is finishing the\\r\\njob alone. And their job is on the same staircase as the murder, on\\r\\nthe second floor. When I heard all that I did not say a word to\\r\\nanyone’--that’s Dushkin’s tale--‘but I found out what I could about\\r\\nthe murder, and went home feeling as suspicious as ever. And at eight\\r\\no’clock this morning’--that was the third day, you understand--‘I saw\\r\\nNikolay coming in, not sober, though not to say very drunk--he could\\r\\nunderstand what was said to him. He sat down on the bench and did not\\r\\nspeak. There was only one stranger in the bar and a man I knew asleep\\r\\non a bench and our two boys. “Have you seen Dmitri?” said I. “No, I\\r\\nhaven’t,” said he. “And you’ve not been here either?” “Not since the day\\r\\nbefore yesterday,” said he. “And where did you sleep last night?”\\r\\n “In Peski, with the Kolomensky men.” “And where did you get those\\r\\near-rings?” I asked. “I found them in the street,” and the way he said\\r\\nit was a bit queer; he did not look at me. “Did you hear what happened\\r\\nthat very evening, at that very hour, on that same staircase?” said I.\\r\\n“No,” said he, “I had not heard,” and all the while he was listening,\\r\\nhis eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk. I\\r\\ntold him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up. I wanted\\r\\nto keep him. “Wait a bit, Nikolay,” said I, “won’t you have a drink?”\\r\\n And I signed to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from behind the\\r\\nbar; but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run.\\r\\nI have not seen him since. Then my doubts were at an end--it was his\\r\\ndoing, as clear as could be....’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should think so,” said Zossimov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait! Hear the end. Of course they sought high and low for Nikolay;\\r\\nthey detained Dushkin and searched his house; Dmitri, too, was arrested;\\r\\nthe Kolomensky men also were turned inside out. And the day before\\r\\nyesterday they arrested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town. He\\r\\nhad gone there, taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram\\r\\nfor it. They gave it to him. A few minutes afterwards the woman went\\r\\nto the cowshed, and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable\\r\\nadjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam, stood on a\\r\\nblock of wood, and was trying to put his neck in the noose. The woman\\r\\nscreeched her hardest; people ran in. ‘So that’s what you are up to!’\\r\\n‘Take me,’ he says, ‘to such-and-such a police officer; I’ll confess\\r\\neverything.’ Well, they took him to that police station--that is\\r\\nhere--with a suitable escort. So they asked him this and that, how old\\r\\nhe is, ‘twenty-two,’ and so on. At the question, ‘When you were working\\r\\nwith Dmitri, didn’t you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a\\r\\ntime?’--answer: ‘To be sure folks may have gone up and down, but I did\\r\\nnot notice them.’ ‘And didn’t you hear anything, any noise, and so on?’\\r\\n‘We heard nothing special.’ ‘And did you hear, Nikolay, that on the same\\r\\nday Widow So-and-so and her sister were murdered and robbed?’ ‘I\\r\\nnever knew a thing about it. The first I heard of it was from Afanasy\\r\\nPavlovitch the day before yesterday.’ ‘And where did you find the\\r\\near-rings?’ ‘I found them on the pavement.’ ‘Why didn’t you go to work\\r\\nwith Dmitri the other day?’ ‘Because I was drinking.’ ‘And where were\\r\\nyou drinking?’ ‘Oh, in such-and-such a place.’ ‘Why did you run away\\r\\nfrom Dushkin’s?’ ‘Because I was awfully frightened.’ ‘What were\\r\\nyou frightened of?’ ‘That I should be accused.’ ‘How could you be\\r\\nfrightened, if you felt free from guilt?’ Now, Zossimov, you may not\\r\\nbelieve me, that question was put literally in those words. I know it\\r\\nfor a fact, it was repeated to me exactly! What do you say to that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, anyway, there’s the evidence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am not talking of the evidence now, I am talking about that question,\\r\\nof their own idea of themselves. Well, so they squeezed and squeezed\\r\\nhim and he confessed: ‘I did not find it in the street, but in the flat\\r\\nwhere I was painting with Dmitri.’ ‘And how was that?’ ‘Why, Dmitri and\\r\\nI were painting there all day, and we were just getting ready to go, and\\r\\nDmitri took a brush and painted my face, and he ran off and I after him.\\r\\nI ran after him, shouting my hardest, and at the bottom of the stairs I\\r\\nran right against the porter and some gentlemen--and how many gentlemen\\r\\nwere there I don’t remember. And the porter swore at me, and the other\\r\\nporter swore, too, and the porter’s wife came out, and swore at us, too;\\r\\nand a gentleman came into the entry with a lady, and he swore at us,\\r\\ntoo, for Dmitri and I lay right across the way. I got hold of Dmitri’s\\r\\nhair and knocked him down and began beating him. And Dmitri, too, caught\\r\\nme by the hair and began beating me. But we did it all not for temper\\r\\nbut in a friendly way, for sport. And then Dmitri escaped and ran into\\r\\nthe street, and I ran after him; but I did not catch him, and went back\\r\\nto the flat alone; I had to clear up my things. I began putting them\\r\\ntogether, expecting Dmitri to come, and there in the passage, in the\\r\\ncorner by the door, I stepped on the box. I saw it lying there wrapped\\r\\nup in paper. I took off the paper, saw some little hooks, undid them,\\r\\nand in the box were the ear-rings....’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Behind the door? Lying behind the door? Behind the door?” Raskolnikov\\r\\ncried suddenly, staring with a blank look of terror at Razumihin, and he\\r\\nslowly sat up on the sofa, leaning on his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes... why? What’s the matter? What’s wrong?” Razumihin, too, got up\\r\\nfrom his seat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing,” Raskolnikov answered faintly, turning to the wall. All were\\r\\nsilent for a while.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He must have waked from a dream,” Razumihin said at last, looking\\r\\ninquiringly at Zossimov. The latter slightly shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, go on,” said Zossimov. “What next?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What next? As soon as he saw the ear-rings, forgetting Dmitri and\\r\\neverything, he took up his cap and ran to Dushkin and, as we know, got\\r\\na rouble from him. He told a lie saying he found them in the street, and\\r\\nwent off drinking. He keeps repeating his old story about the murder:\\r\\n‘I know nothing of it, never heard of it till the day before yesterday.’\\r\\n‘And why didn’t you come to the police till now?’ ‘I was frightened.’\\r\\n‘And why did you try to hang yourself?’ ‘From anxiety.’ ‘What anxiety?’\\r\\n‘That I should be accused of it.’ Well, that’s the whole story. And now\\r\\nwhat do you suppose they deduced from that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, there’s no supposing. There’s a clue, such as it is, a fact. You\\r\\nwouldn’t have your painter set free?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now they’ve simply taken him for the murderer. They haven’t a shadow of\\r\\ndoubt.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s nonsense. You are excited. But what about the ear-rings? You\\r\\nmust admit that, if on the very same day and hour ear-rings from the old\\r\\nwoman’s box have come into Nikolay’s hands, they must have come there\\r\\nsomehow. That’s a good deal in such a case.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How did they get there? How did they get there?” cried Razumihin.\\r\\n“How can you, a doctor, whose duty it is to study man and who has more\\r\\nopportunity than anyone else for studying human nature--how can you fail\\r\\nto see the character of the man in the whole story? Don’t you see at\\r\\nonce that the answers he has given in the examination are the holy\\r\\ntruth? They came into his hand precisely as he has told us--he stepped\\r\\non the box and picked it up.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The holy truth! But didn’t he own himself that he told a lie at first?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen to me, listen attentively. The porter and Koch and Pestryakov\\r\\nand the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who\\r\\nwas sitting in the porter’s lodge and the man Kryukov, who had just got\\r\\nout of a cab at that minute and went in at the entry with a lady on his\\r\\narm, that is eight or ten witnesses, agree that Nikolay had Dmitri on\\r\\nthe ground, was lying on him beating him, while Dmitri hung on to his\\r\\nhair, beating him, too. They lay right across the way, blocking the\\r\\nthoroughfare. They were sworn at on all sides while they ‘like children’\\r\\n(the very words of the witnesses) were falling over one another,\\r\\nsquealing, fighting and laughing with the funniest faces, and, chasing\\r\\none another like children, they ran into the street. Now take careful\\r\\nnote. The bodies upstairs were warm, you understand, warm when they\\r\\nfound them! If they, or Nikolay alone, had murdered them and broken open\\r\\nthe boxes, or simply taken part in the robbery, allow me to ask you one\\r\\nquestion: do their state of mind, their squeals and giggles and childish\\r\\nscuffling at the gate fit in with axes, bloodshed, fiendish cunning,\\r\\nrobbery? They’d just killed them, not five or ten minutes before, for\\r\\nthe bodies were still warm, and at once, leaving the flat open, knowing\\r\\nthat people would go there at once, flinging away their booty, they\\r\\nrolled about like children, laughing and attracting general attention.\\r\\nAnd there are a dozen witnesses to swear to that!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course it is strange! It’s impossible, indeed, but...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, brother, no _buts_. And if the ear-rings being found in Nikolay’s\\r\\nhands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important\\r\\npiece of circumstantial evidence against him--although the explanation\\r\\ngiven by him accounts for it, and therefore it does not tell seriously\\r\\nagainst him--one must take into consideration the facts which prove him\\r\\ninnocent, especially as they are facts that _cannot be denied_. And\\r\\ndo you suppose, from the character of our legal system, that they will\\r\\naccept, or that they are in a position to accept, this fact--resting\\r\\nsimply on a psychological impossibility--as irrefutable and conclusively\\r\\nbreaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution? No, they\\r\\nwon’t accept it, they certainly won’t, because they found the jewel-case\\r\\nand the man tried to hang himself, ‘which he could not have done if he\\r\\nhadn’t felt guilty.’ That’s the point, that’s what excites me, you must\\r\\nunderstand!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I see you are excited! Wait a bit. I forgot to ask you; what proof\\r\\nis there that the box came from the old woman?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s been proved,” said Razumihin with apparent reluctance, frowning.\\r\\n“Koch recognised the jewel-case and gave the name of the owner, who\\r\\nproved conclusively that it was his.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s bad. Now another point. Did anyone see Nikolay at the time\\r\\nthat Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs at first, and is there no\\r\\nevidence about that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nobody did see him,” Razumihin answered with vexation. “That’s the\\r\\nworst of it. Even Koch and Pestryakov did not notice them on their way\\r\\nupstairs, though, indeed, their evidence could not have been worth much.\\r\\nThey said they saw the flat was open, and that there must be work going\\r\\non in it, but they took no special notice and could not remember whether\\r\\nthere actually were men at work in it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hm!... So the only evidence for the defence is that they were beating\\r\\none another and laughing. That constitutes a strong presumption, but...\\r\\nHow do you explain the facts yourself?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do I explain them? What is there to explain? It’s clear. At any\\r\\nrate, the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear, and\\r\\nthe jewel-case points to it. The real murderer dropped those ear-rings.\\r\\nThe murderer was upstairs, locked in, when Koch and Pestryakov knocked\\r\\nat the door. Koch, like an ass, did not stay at the door; so the\\r\\nmurderer popped out and ran down, too; for he had no other way of\\r\\nescape. He hid from Koch, Pestryakov and the porter in the flat when\\r\\nNikolay and Dmitri had just run out of it. He stopped there while the\\r\\nporter and others were going upstairs, waited till they were out of\\r\\nhearing, and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitri\\r\\nand Nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry;\\r\\npossibly he was seen, but not noticed. There are lots of people going\\r\\nin and out. He must have dropped the ear-rings out of his pocket when\\r\\nhe stood behind the door, and did not notice he dropped them, because he\\r\\nhad other things to think of. The jewel-case is a conclusive proof that\\r\\nhe did stand there.... That’s how I explain it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Too clever! No, my boy, you’re too clever. That beats everything.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But, why, why?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, because everything fits too well... it’s too melodramatic.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A-ach!” Razumihin was exclaiming, but at that moment the door opened\\r\\nand a personage came in who was a stranger to all present.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff and portly appearance,\\r\\nand a cautious and sour countenance. He began by stopping short in the\\r\\ndoorway, staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment,\\r\\nas though asking himself what sort of place he had come to.\\r\\nMistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost\\r\\naffronted, he scanned Raskolnikov’s low and narrow “cabin.” With the\\r\\nsame amazement he stared at Raskolnikov, who lay undressed, dishevelled,\\r\\nunwashed, on his miserable dirty sofa, looking fixedly at him. Then with\\r\\nthe same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth, unkempt figure and\\r\\nunshaven face of Razumihin, who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the\\r\\nface without rising from his seat. A constrained silence lasted for a\\r\\ncouple of minutes, and then, as might be expected, some scene-shifting\\r\\ntook place. Reflecting, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs,\\r\\nthat he would get nothing in this “cabin” by attempting to overawe them,\\r\\nthe gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, though with some severity,\\r\\nemphasising every syllable of his question, addressed Zossimov:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or formerly a student?”\\r\\n\\r\\nZossimov made a slight movement, and would have answered, had not\\r\\nRazumihin anticipated him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here he is lying on the sofa! What do you want?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis familiar “what do you want” seemed to cut the ground from the\\r\\nfeet of the pompous gentleman. He was turning to Razumihin, but checked\\r\\nhimself in time and turned to Zossimov again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is Raskolnikov,” mumbled Zossimov, nodding towards him. Then he\\r\\ngave a prolonged yawn, opening his mouth as wide as possible. Then he\\r\\nlazily put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold\\r\\nwatch in a round hunter’s case, opened it, looked at it and as slowly\\r\\nand lazily proceeded to put it back.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, gazing\\r\\npersistently, though without understanding, at the stranger. Now that\\r\\nhis face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper, it\\r\\nwas extremely pale and wore a look of anguish, as though he had just\\r\\nundergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack. But\\r\\nthe new-comer gradually began to arouse his attention, then his wonder,\\r\\nthen suspicion and even alarm. When Zossimov said “This is Raskolnikov”\\r\\n he jumped up quickly, sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant, but\\r\\nweak and breaking, voice articulated:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I am Raskolnikov! What do you want?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. I believe I have reason to hope that my name\\r\\nis not wholly unknown to you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Raskolnikov, who had expected something quite different, gazed\\r\\nblankly and dreamily at him, making no reply, as though he heard the\\r\\nname of Pyotr Petrovitch for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it possible that you can up to the present have received no\\r\\ninformation?” asked Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn reply Raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow, put his hands\\r\\nbehind his head and gazed at the ceiling. A look of dismay came into\\r\\nLuzhin’s face. Zossimov and Razumihin stared at him more inquisitively\\r\\nthan ever, and at last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had presumed and calculated,” he faltered, “that a letter posted more\\r\\nthan ten days, if not a fortnight ago...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say, why are you standing in the doorway?” Razumihin interrupted\\r\\nsuddenly. “If you’ve something to say, sit down. Nastasya and you are so\\r\\ncrowded. Nastasya, make room. Here’s a chair, thread your way in!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe moved his chair back from the table, made a little space between the\\r\\ntable and his knees, and waited in a rather cramped position for the\\r\\nvisitor to “thread his way in.” The minute was so chosen that it was\\r\\nimpossible to refuse, and the visitor squeezed his way through, hurrying\\r\\nand stumbling. Reaching the chair, he sat down, looking suspiciously at\\r\\nRazumihin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No need to be nervous,” the latter blurted out. “Rodya has been ill for\\r\\nthe last five days and delirious for three, but now he is recovering and\\r\\nhas got an appetite. This is his doctor, who has just had a look at him.\\r\\nI am a comrade of Rodya’s, like him, formerly a student, and now I am\\r\\nnursing him; so don’t you take any notice of us, but go on with your\\r\\nbusiness.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you. But shall I not disturb the invalid by my presence and\\r\\nconversation?” Pyotr Petrovitch asked of Zossimov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“N-no,” mumbled Zossimov; “you may amuse him.” He yawned again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has been conscious a long time, since the morning,” went on\\r\\nRazumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good-nature\\r\\nthat Pyotr Petrovitch began to be more cheerful, partly, perhaps,\\r\\nbecause this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as a\\r\\nstudent.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your mamma,” began Luzhin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hm!” Razumihin cleared his throat loudly. Luzhin looked at him\\r\\ninquiringly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s all right, go on.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLuzhin shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your mamma had commenced a letter to you while I was sojourning in\\r\\nher neighbourhood. On my arrival here I purposely allowed a few days to\\r\\nelapse before coming to see you, in order that I might be fully\\r\\nassured that you were in full possession of the tidings; but now, to my\\r\\nastonishment...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know, I know!” Raskolnikov cried suddenly with impatient vexation.\\r\\n“So you are the _fiancé_? I know, and that’s enough!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitch’s being offended this time,\\r\\nbut he said nothing. He made a violent effort to understand what it all\\r\\nmeant. There was a moment’s silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards him when he\\r\\nanswered, began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity, as\\r\\nthough he had not had a good look at him yet, or as though something\\r\\nnew had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at\\r\\nhim. There certainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitch’s whole\\r\\nappearance, something which seemed to justify the title of “fiancé” so\\r\\nunceremoniously applied to him. In the first place, it was evident, far\\r\\ntoo much so indeed, that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his few\\r\\ndays in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation\\r\\nof his betrothed--a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding,\\r\\nindeed. Even his own, perhaps too complacent, consciousness of the\\r\\nagreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such\\r\\ncircumstances, seeing that Pyotr Petrovitch had taken up the rôle of\\r\\nfiancé. All his clothes were fresh from the tailor’s and were all\\r\\nright, except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate. Even\\r\\nthe stylish new round hat had the same significance. Pyotr Petrovitch\\r\\ntreated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands. The\\r\\nexquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, told the same tale,\\r\\nif only from the fact of his not wearing them, but carrying them in\\r\\nhis hand for show. Light and youthful colours predominated in Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch’s attire. He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade,\\r\\nlight thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a\\r\\ncravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the best\\r\\nof it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch. His very fresh and even\\r\\nhandsome face looked younger than his forty-five years at all times.\\r\\nHis dark, mutton-chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides,\\r\\ngrowing thickly upon his shining, clean-shaven chin. Even his hair,\\r\\ntouched here and there with grey, though it had been combed and curled\\r\\nat a hairdresser’s, did not give him a stupid appearance, as curled hair\\r\\nusually does, by inevitably suggesting a German on his wedding-day.\\r\\nIf there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather\\r\\ngood-looking and imposing countenance, it was due to quite other\\r\\ncauses. After scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov smiled\\r\\nmalignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as\\r\\nbefore.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no\\r\\nnotice of their oddities.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation,” he began,\\r\\nagain breaking the silence with an effort. “If I had been aware of your\\r\\nillness I should have come earlier. But you know what business is. I\\r\\nhave, too, a very important legal affair in the Senate, not to mention\\r\\nother preoccupations which you may well conjecture. I am expecting your\\r\\nmamma and sister any minute.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak; his face showed\\r\\nsome excitement. Pyotr Petrovitch paused, waited, but as nothing\\r\\nfollowed, he went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n“... Any minute. I have found a lodging for them on their arrival.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where?” asked Raskolnikov weakly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very near here, in Bakaleyev’s house.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s in Voskresensky,” put in Razumihin. “There are two storeys of\\r\\nrooms, let by a merchant called Yushin; I’ve been there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, rooms...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A disgusting place--filthy, stinking and, what’s more, of doubtful\\r\\ncharacter. Things have happened there, and there are all sorts of queer\\r\\npeople living there. And I went there about a scandalous business. It’s\\r\\ncheap, though...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I could not, of course, find out so much about it, for I am a stranger\\r\\nin Petersburg myself,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied huffily. “However, the\\r\\ntwo rooms are exceedingly clean, and as it is for so short a time...\\r\\nI have already taken a permanent, that is, our future flat,” he said,\\r\\naddressing Raskolnikov, “and I am having it done up. And meanwhile I am\\r\\nmyself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend Andrey Semyonovitch\\r\\nLebeziatnikov, in the flat of Madame Lippevechsel; it was he who told me\\r\\nof Bakaleyev’s house, too...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lebeziatnikov?” said Raskolnikov slowly, as if recalling something.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the Ministry. Do you\\r\\nknow him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes... no,” Raskolnikov answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me, I fancied so from your inquiry. I was once his guardian....\\r\\nA very nice young man and advanced. I like to meet young people: one\\r\\nlearns new things from them.” Luzhin looked round hopefully at them all.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you mean?” asked Razumihin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the most serious and essential matters,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied,\\r\\nas though delighted at the question. “You see, it’s ten years since I\\r\\nvisited Petersburg. All the novelties, reforms, ideas have reached us in\\r\\nthe provinces, but to see it all more clearly one must be in Petersburg.\\r\\nAnd it’s my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the\\r\\nyounger generation. And I confess I am delighted...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“At what?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your question is a wide one. I may be mistaken, but I fancy I find\\r\\nclearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more practicality...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s true,” Zossimov let drop.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nonsense! There’s no practicality.” Razumihin flew at him.\\r\\n“Practicality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from\\r\\nheaven. And for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from\\r\\nall practical life. Ideas, if you like, are fermenting,” he said to\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch, “and desire for good exists, though it’s in a childish\\r\\nform, and honesty you may find, although there are crowds of brigands.\\r\\nAnyway, there’s no practicality. Practicality goes well shod.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t agree with you,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied, with evident\\r\\nenjoyment. “Of course, people do get carried away and make mistakes,\\r\\nbut one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence of\\r\\nenthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment. If little\\r\\nhas been done, the time has been but short; of means I will not speak.\\r\\nIt’s my personal view, if you care to know, that something has been\\r\\naccomplished already. New valuable ideas, new valuable works are\\r\\ncirculating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors.\\r\\nLiterature is taking a maturer form, many injurious prejudices have been\\r\\nrooted up and turned into ridicule.... In a word, we have cut ourselves\\r\\noff irrevocably from the past, and that, to my thinking, is a great\\r\\nthing...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s learnt it by heart to show off!” Raskolnikov pronounced suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What?” asked Pyotr Petrovitch, not catching his words; but he received\\r\\nno reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s all true,” Zossimov hastened to interpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Isn’t it so?” Pyotr Petrovitch went on, glancing affably at Zossimov.\\r\\n“You must admit,” he went on, addressing Razumihin with a shade of\\r\\ntriumph and superciliousness--he almost added “young man”--“that there\\r\\nis an advance, or, as they say now, progress in the name of science and\\r\\neconomic truth...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A commonplace.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, not a commonplace! Hitherto, for instance, if I were told, ‘love\\r\\nthy neighbour,’ what came of it?” Pyotr Petrovitch went on, perhaps with\\r\\nexcessive haste. “It came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my\\r\\nneighbour and we both were left half naked. As a Russian proverb has\\r\\nit, ‘Catch several hares and you won’t catch one.’ Science now tells\\r\\nus, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on\\r\\nself-interest. You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly\\r\\nand your coat remains whole. Economic truth adds that the better private\\r\\naffairs are organised in society--the more whole coats, so to say--the\\r\\nfirmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare\\r\\norganised too. Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for\\r\\nmyself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to bring to\\r\\npass my neighbour’s getting a little more than a torn coat; and that not\\r\\nfrom private, personal liberality, but as a consequence of the general\\r\\nadvance. The idea is simple, but unhappily it has been a long time\\r\\nreaching us, being hindered by idealism and sentimentality. And yet it\\r\\nwould seem to want very little wit to perceive it...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me, I’ve very little wit myself,” Razumihin cut in sharply,\\r\\n“and so let us drop it. I began this discussion with an object, but I’ve\\r\\ngrown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuse\\r\\noneself, of this incessant flow of commonplaces, always the same, that,\\r\\nby Jove, I blush even when other people talk like that. You are in a\\r\\nhurry, no doubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and I don’t blame you,\\r\\nthat’s quite pardonable. I only wanted to find out what sort of man you\\r\\nare, for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive\\r\\ncause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everything\\r\\nthey touched, that the whole cause has been dragged in the mire. That’s\\r\\nenough!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me, sir,” said Luzhin, affronted, and speaking with excessive\\r\\ndignity. “Do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that I too...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, my dear sir... how could I?... Come, that’s enough,” Razumihin\\r\\nconcluded, and he turned abruptly to Zossimov to continue their previous\\r\\nconversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch had the good sense to accept the disavowal. He made up\\r\\nhis mind to take leave in another minute or two.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I trust our acquaintance,” he said, addressing Raskolnikov, “may, upon\\r\\nyour recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware,\\r\\nbecome closer... Above all, I hope for your return to health...”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov did not even turn his head. Pyotr Petrovitch began getting\\r\\nup from his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One of her customers must have killed her,” Zossimov declared\\r\\npositively.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a doubt of it,” replied Razumihin. “Porfiry doesn’t give his\\r\\nopinion, but is examining all who have left pledges with her there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Examining them?” Raskolnikov asked aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. What then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How does he get hold of them?” asked Zossimov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Koch has given the names of some of them, other names are on the\\r\\nwrappers of the pledges and some have come forward of themselves.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It must have been a cunning and practised ruffian! The boldness of it!\\r\\nThe coolness!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s just what it wasn’t!” interposed Razumihin. “That’s what throws\\r\\nyou all off the scent. But I maintain that he is not cunning, not\\r\\npractised, and probably this was his first crime! The supposition that\\r\\nit was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesn’t work. Suppose\\r\\nhim to have been inexperienced, and it’s clear that it was only a chance\\r\\nthat saved him--and chance may do anything. Why, he did not foresee\\r\\nobstacles, perhaps! And how did he set to work? He took jewels worth\\r\\nten or twenty roubles, stuffing his pockets with them, ransacked the\\r\\nold woman’s trunks, her rags--and they found fifteen hundred roubles,\\r\\nbesides notes, in a box in the top drawer of the chest! He did not know\\r\\nhow to rob; he could only murder. It was his first crime, I assure you,\\r\\nhis first crime; he lost his head. And he got off more by luck than good\\r\\ncounsel!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker, I believe?” Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch put in, addressing Zossimov. He was standing, hat and gloves\\r\\nin hand, but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more\\r\\nintellectual phrases. He was evidently anxious to make a favourable\\r\\nimpression and his vanity overcame his prudence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. You’ve heard of it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes, being in the neighbourhood.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know the details?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t say that; but another circumstance interests me in the\\r\\ncase--the whole question, so to say. Not to speak of the fact that crime\\r\\nhas been greatly on the increase among the lower classes during the last\\r\\nfive years, not to speak of the cases of robbery and arson everywhere,\\r\\nwhat strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes,\\r\\ntoo, crime is increasing proportionately. In one place one hears of a\\r\\nstudent’s robbing the mail on the high road; in another place people of\\r\\ngood social position forge false banknotes; in Moscow of late a whole\\r\\ngang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets, and one of\\r\\nthe ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history; then our secretary\\r\\nabroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain.... And if this old\\r\\nwoman, the pawnbroker, has been murdered by someone of a higher class\\r\\nin society--for peasants don’t pawn gold trinkets--how are we to explain\\r\\nthis demoralisation of the civilised part of our society?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are many economic changes,” put in Zossimov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How are we to explain it?” Razumihin caught him up. “It might be\\r\\nexplained by our inveterate impracticality.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to the question why he\\r\\nwas forging notes? ‘Everybody is getting rich one way or another, so I\\r\\nwant to make haste to get rich too.’ I don’t remember the exact words,\\r\\nbut the upshot was that he wants money for nothing, without waiting or\\r\\nworking! We’ve grown used to having everything ready-made, to walking\\r\\non crutches, to having our food chewed for us. Then the great hour\\r\\nstruck,[*] and every man showed himself in his true colours.”\\r\\n\\r\\n     [*] The emancipation of the serfs in 1861 is meant.\\r\\n     --TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But morality? And so to speak, principles...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But why do you worry about it?” Raskolnikov interposed suddenly. “It’s\\r\\nin accordance with your theory!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In accordance with my theory?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now, and\\r\\nit follows that people may be killed...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Upon my word!” cried Luzhin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, that’s not so,” put in Zossimov.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper lip, breathing\\r\\npainfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s a measure in all things,” Luzhin went on superciliously.\\r\\n“Economic ideas are not an incitement to murder, and one has but to\\r\\nsuppose...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And is it true,” Raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly, again in a\\r\\nvoice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him, “is it true that\\r\\nyou told your _fiancée_... within an hour of her acceptance, that what\\r\\npleased you most... was that she was a beggar... because it was better\\r\\nto raise a wife from poverty, so that you may have complete control over\\r\\nher, and reproach her with your being her benefactor?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Upon my word,” Luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably, crimson with\\r\\nconfusion, “to distort my words in this way! Excuse me, allow me to\\r\\nassure you that the report which has reached you, or rather, let me say,\\r\\nhas been conveyed to you, has no foundation in truth, and I... suspect\\r\\nwho... in a word... this arrow... in a word, your mamma... She seemed\\r\\nto me in other things, with all her excellent qualities, of a somewhat\\r\\nhigh-flown and romantic way of thinking.... But I was a thousand miles\\r\\nfrom supposing that she would misunderstand and misrepresent things in\\r\\nso fanciful a way.... And indeed... indeed...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I tell you what,” cried Raskolnikov, raising himself on his pillow and\\r\\nfixing his piercing, glittering eyes upon him, “I tell you what.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What?” Luzhin stood still, waiting with a defiant and offended face.\\r\\nSilence lasted for some seconds.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, if ever again... you dare to mention a single word... about my\\r\\nmother... I shall send you flying downstairs!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s the matter with you?” cried Razumihin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So that’s how it is?” Luzhin turned pale and bit his lip. “Let me tell\\r\\nyou, sir,” he began deliberately, doing his utmost to restrain himself\\r\\nbut breathing hard, “at the first moment I saw you you were ill-disposed\\r\\nto me, but I remained here on purpose to find out more. I could forgive\\r\\na great deal in a sick man and a connection, but you... never after\\r\\nthis...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am not ill,” cried Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So much the worse...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go to hell!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Luzhin was already leaving without finishing his speech, squeezing\\r\\nbetween the table and the chair; Razumihin got up this time to let him\\r\\npass. Without glancing at anyone, and not even nodding to Zossimov, who\\r\\nhad for some time been making signs to him to let the sick man alone,\\r\\nhe went out, lifting his hat to the level of his shoulders to avoid\\r\\ncrushing it as he stooped to go out of the door. And even the curve of\\r\\nhis spine was expressive of the horrible insult he had received.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How could you--how could you!” Razumihin said, shaking his head in\\r\\nperplexity.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me alone--let me alone all of you!” Raskolnikov cried in a frenzy.\\r\\n“Will you ever leave off tormenting me? I am not afraid of you! I am\\r\\nnot afraid of anyone, anyone now! Get away from me! I want to be alone,\\r\\nalone, alone!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come along,” said Zossimov, nodding to Razumihin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But we can’t leave him like this!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come along,” Zossimov repeated insistently, and he went out. Razumihin\\r\\nthought a minute and ran to overtake him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It might be worse not to obey him,” said Zossimov on the stairs. “He\\r\\nmustn’t be irritated.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s the matter with him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If only he could get some favourable shock, that’s what would do it! At\\r\\nfirst he was better.... You know he has got something on his mind! Some\\r\\nfixed idea weighing on him.... I am very much afraid so; he must have!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps it’s that gentleman, Pyotr Petrovitch. From his conversation\\r\\nI gather he is going to marry his sister, and that he had received a\\r\\nletter about it just before his illness....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, confound the man! he may have upset the case altogether. But have\\r\\nyou noticed, he takes no interest in anything, he does not respond to\\r\\nanything except one point on which he seems excited--that’s the murder?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes,” Razumihin agreed, “I noticed that, too. He is interested,\\r\\nfrightened. It gave him a shock on the day he was ill in the police\\r\\noffice; he fainted.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell me more about that this evening and I’ll tell you something\\r\\nafterwards. He interests me very much! In half an hour I’ll go and see\\r\\nhim again.... There’ll be no inflammation though.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thanks! And I’ll wait with Pashenka meantime and will keep watch on him\\r\\nthrough Nastasya....”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov, left alone, looked with impatience and misery at Nastasya,\\r\\nbut she still lingered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Won’t you have some tea now?” she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Later! I am sleepy! Leave me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned abruptly to the wall; Nastasya went out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as soon as she went out, he got up, latched the door, undid the\\r\\nparcel which Razumihin had brought in that evening and had tied up again\\r\\nand began dressing. Strange to say, he seemed immediately to have become\\r\\nperfectly calm; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic\\r\\nfear that had haunted him of late. It was the first moment of a strange\\r\\nsudden calm. His movements were precise and definite; a firm purpose was\\r\\nevident in them. “To-day, to-day,” he muttered to himself. He understood\\r\\nthat he was still weak, but his intense spiritual concentration gave him\\r\\nstrength and self-confidence. He hoped, moreover, that he would not\\r\\nfall down in the street. When he had dressed in entirely new clothes, he\\r\\nlooked at the money lying on the table, and after a moment’s thought\\r\\nput it in his pocket. It was twenty-five roubles. He took also all the\\r\\ncopper change from the ten roubles spent by Razumihin on the clothes.\\r\\nThen he softly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs and\\r\\nglanced in at the open kitchen door. Nastasya was standing with her back\\r\\nto him, blowing up the landlady’s samovar. She heard nothing. Who would\\r\\nhave dreamed of his going out, indeed? A minute later he was in the\\r\\nstreet.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was nearly eight o’clock, the sun was setting. It was as stifling as\\r\\nbefore, but he eagerly drank in the stinking, dusty town air. His head\\r\\nfelt rather dizzy; a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his\\r\\nfeverish eyes and his wasted, pale and yellow face. He did not know and\\r\\ndid not think where he was going, he had one thought only: “that all\\r\\n_this_ must be ended to-day, once for all, immediately; that he would\\r\\nnot return home without it, because he _would not go on living like\\r\\nthat_.” How, with what to make an end? He had not an idea about it,\\r\\nhe did not even want to think of it. He drove away thought; thought\\r\\ntortured him. All he knew, all he felt was that everything must be\\r\\nchanged “one way or another,” he repeated with desperate and immovable\\r\\nself-confidence and determination.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the Hay\\r\\nMarket. A dark-haired young man with a barrel organ was standing in\\r\\nthe road in front of a little general shop and was grinding out a very\\r\\nsentimental song. He was accompanying a girl of fifteen, who stood\\r\\non the pavement in front of him. She was dressed up in a crinoline, a\\r\\nmantle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it, all very\\r\\nold and shabby. In a strong and rather agreeable voice, cracked and\\r\\ncoarsened by street singing, she sang in hope of getting a copper from\\r\\nthe shop. Raskolnikov joined two or three listeners, took out a five\\r\\ncopeck piece and put it in the girl’s hand. She broke off abruptly on a\\r\\nsentimental high note, shouted sharply to the organ grinder “Come on,”\\r\\n and both moved on to the next shop.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you like street music?” said Raskolnikov, addressing a middle-aged\\r\\nman standing idly by him. The man looked at him, startled and wondering.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I love to hear singing to a street organ,” said Raskolnikov, and his\\r\\nmanner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject--“I like it\\r\\non cold, dark, damp autumn evenings--they must be damp--when all the\\r\\npassers-by have pale green, sickly faces, or better still when wet\\r\\nsnow is falling straight down, when there’s no wind--you know what I\\r\\nmean?--and the street lamps shine through it...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know.... Excuse me...” muttered the stranger, frightened by the\\r\\nquestion and Raskolnikov’s strange manner, and he crossed over to the\\r\\nother side of the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the corner of the Hay\\r\\nMarket, where the huckster and his wife had talked with Lizaveta; but\\r\\nthey were not there now. Recognising the place, he stopped, looked round\\r\\nand addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a\\r\\ncorn chandler’s shop.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Isn’t there a man who keeps a booth with his wife at this corner?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All sorts of people keep booths here,” answered the young man, glancing\\r\\nsuperciliously at Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s his name?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What he was christened.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Aren’t you a Zaraïsky man, too? Which province?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man looked at Raskolnikov again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not a province, your excellency, but a district. Graciously\\r\\nforgive me, your excellency!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that a tavern at the top there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it’s an eating-house and there’s a billiard-room and you’ll find\\r\\nprincesses there too.... La-la!”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov crossed the square. In that corner there was a dense crowd\\r\\nof peasants. He pushed his way into the thickest part of it, looking\\r\\nat the faces. He felt an unaccountable inclination to enter into\\r\\nconversation with people. But the peasants took no notice of him; they\\r\\nwere all shouting in groups together. He stood and thought a little and\\r\\ntook a turning to the right in the direction of V.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had often crossed that little street which turns at an angle, leading\\r\\nfrom the market-place to Sadovy Street. Of late he had often felt drawn\\r\\nto wander about this district, when he felt depressed, that he might\\r\\nfeel more so.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow he walked along, thinking of nothing. At that point there is a great\\r\\nblock of buildings, entirely let out in dram shops and eating-houses;\\r\\nwomen were continually running in and out, bare-headed and in their\\r\\nindoor clothes. Here and there they gathered in groups, on the pavement,\\r\\nespecially about the entrances to various festive establishments in\\r\\nthe lower storeys. From one of these a loud din, sounds of singing, the\\r\\ntinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment, floated into the street.\\r\\nA crowd of women were thronging round the door; some were sitting on the\\r\\nsteps, others on the pavement, others were standing talking. A drunken\\r\\nsoldier, smoking a cigarette, was walking near them in the road,\\r\\nswearing; he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere, but had\\r\\nforgotten where. One beggar was quarrelling with another, and a man dead\\r\\ndrunk was lying right across the road. Raskolnikov joined the throng of\\r\\nwomen, who were talking in husky voices. They were bare-headed and wore\\r\\ncotton dresses and goatskin shoes. There were women of forty and some\\r\\nnot more than seventeen; almost all had blackened eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and\\r\\nuproar in the saloon below.... someone could be heard within dancing\\r\\nfrantically, marking time with his heels to the sounds of the guitar\\r\\nand of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air. He listened intently,\\r\\ngloomily and dreamily, bending down at the entrance and peeping\\r\\ninquisitively in from the pavement.\\r\\n\\r\\n  “Oh, my handsome soldier\\r\\n   Don’t beat me for nothing,”\\r\\n\\r\\ntrilled the thin voice of the singer. Raskolnikov felt a great desire to\\r\\nmake out what he was singing, as though everything depended on that.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shall I go in?” he thought. “They are laughing. From drink. Shall I get\\r\\ndrunk?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Won’t you come in?” one of the women asked him. Her voice was\\r\\nstill musical and less thick than the others, she was young and not\\r\\nrepulsive--the only one of the group.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, she’s pretty,” he said, drawing himself up and looking at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled, much pleased at the compliment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re very nice looking yourself,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Isn’t he thin though!” observed another woman in a deep bass. “Have you\\r\\njust come out of a hospital?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They’re all generals’ daughters, it seems, but they have all snub\\r\\nnoses,” interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face, wearing\\r\\na loose coat. “See how jolly they are.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go along with you!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll go, sweetie!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he darted down into the saloon below. Raskolnikov moved on.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say, sir,” the girl shouted after him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll always be pleased to spend an hour with you, kind gentleman, but\\r\\nnow I feel shy. Give me six copecks for a drink, there’s a nice young\\r\\nman!”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov gave her what came first--fifteen copecks.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, what a good-natured gentleman!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s your name?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ask for Duclida.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, that’s too much,” one of the women observed, shaking her head\\r\\nat Duclida. “I don’t know how you can ask like that. I believe I should\\r\\ndrop with shame....”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker. She was a pock-marked wench\\r\\nof thirty, covered with bruises, with her upper lip swollen. She made\\r\\nher criticism quietly and earnestly. “Where is it,” thought Raskolnikov.\\r\\n“Where is it I’ve read that someone condemned to death says or thinks,\\r\\nan hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high rock,\\r\\non such a narrow ledge that he’d only room to stand, and the ocean,\\r\\neverlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlasting tempest around\\r\\nhim, if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his\\r\\nlife, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to live so than to die\\r\\nat once! Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!...\\r\\nHow true it is! Good God, how true! Man is a vile creature!... And vile\\r\\nis he who calls him vile for that,” he added a moment later.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went into another street. “Bah, the Palais de Cristal! Razumihin\\r\\nwas just talking of the Palais de Cristal. But what on earth was it\\r\\nI wanted? Yes, the newspapers.... Zossimov said he’d read it in the\\r\\npapers. Have you the papers?” he asked, going into a very spacious and\\r\\npositively clean restaurant, consisting of several rooms, which were,\\r\\nhowever, rather empty. Two or three people were drinking tea, and in a\\r\\nroom further away were sitting four men drinking champagne. Raskolnikov\\r\\nfancied that Zametov was one of them, but he could not be sure at that\\r\\ndistance. “What if it is?” he thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Will you have vodka?” asked the waiter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give me some tea and bring me the papers, the old ones for the last\\r\\nfive days, and I’ll give you something.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, here’s to-day’s. No vodka?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old newspapers and the tea were brought. Raskolnikov sat down and\\r\\nbegan to look through them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, damn... these are the items of intelligence. An accident on a\\r\\nstaircase, spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol, a fire\\r\\nin Peski... a fire in the Petersburg quarter... another fire in the\\r\\nPetersburg quarter... and another fire in the Petersburg quarter....\\r\\nAh, here it is!” He found at last what he was seeking and began to\\r\\nread it. The lines danced before his eyes, but he read it all and began\\r\\neagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers. His hands\\r\\nshook with nervous impatience as he turned the sheets. Suddenly someone\\r\\nsat down beside him at his table. He looked up, it was the head clerk\\r\\nZametov, looking just the same, with the rings on his fingers and the\\r\\nwatch-chain, with the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with the\\r\\nsmart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen. He was in a good\\r\\nhumour, at least he was smiling very gaily and good-humouredly. His dark\\r\\nface was rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What, you here?” he began in surprise, speaking as though he’d known\\r\\nhim all his life. “Why, Razumihin told me only yesterday you were\\r\\nunconscious. How strange! And do you know I’ve been to see you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov knew he would come up to him. He laid aside the papers and\\r\\nturned to Zametov. There was a smile on his lips, and a new shade of\\r\\nirritable impatience was apparent in that smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know you have,” he answered. “I’ve heard it. You looked for my\\r\\nsock.... And you know Razumihin has lost his heart to you? He says\\r\\nyou’ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna’s--you know, the woman you tried\\r\\nto befriend, for whom you winked to the Explosive Lieutenant and he\\r\\nwould not understand. Do you remember? How could he fail to\\r\\nunderstand--it was quite clear, wasn’t it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a hot head he is!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The explosive one?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, your friend Razumihin.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must have a jolly life, Mr. Zametov; entrance free to the most\\r\\nagreeable places. Who’s been pouring champagne into you just now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ve just been... having a drink together.... You talk about pouring\\r\\nit into me!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By way of a fee! You profit by everything!” Raskolnikov laughed, “it’s\\r\\nall right, my dear boy,” he added, slapping Zametov on the shoulder. “I\\r\\nam not speaking from temper, but in a friendly way, for sport, as that\\r\\nworkman of yours said when he was scuffling with Dmitri, in the case of\\r\\nthe old woman....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you know about it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps I know more about it than you do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How strange you are.... I am sure you are still very unwell. You\\r\\noughtn’t to have come out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, do I seem strange to you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. What are you doing, reading the papers?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s a lot about the fires.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I am not reading about the fires.” Here he looked mysteriously at\\r\\nZametov; his lips were twisted again in a mocking smile. “No, I am not\\r\\nreading about the fires,” he went on, winking at Zametov. “But confess\\r\\nnow, my dear fellow, you’re awfully anxious to know what I am reading\\r\\nabout?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am not in the least. Mayn’t I ask a question? Why do you keep\\r\\non...?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen, you are a man of culture and education?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was in the sixth class at the gymnasium,” said Zametov with some\\r\\ndignity.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sixth class! Ah, my cock-sparrow! With your parting and your rings--you\\r\\nare a gentleman of fortune. Foo! what a charming boy!” Here Raskolnikov\\r\\nbroke into a nervous laugh right in Zametov’s face. The latter drew\\r\\nback, more amazed than offended.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Foo! how strange you are!” Zametov repeated very seriously. “I can’t\\r\\nhelp thinking you are still delirious.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am delirious? You are fibbing, my cock-sparrow! So I am strange? You\\r\\nfind me curious, do you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, curious.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shall I tell you what I was reading about, what I was looking for? See\\r\\nwhat a lot of papers I’ve made them bring me. Suspicious, eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, what is it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You prick up your ears?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you mean--‘prick up my ears’?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll explain that afterwards, but now, my boy, I declare to you... no,\\r\\nbetter ‘I confess’... No, that’s not right either; ‘I make a deposition\\r\\nand you take it.’ I depose that I was reading, that I was looking and\\r\\nsearching....” he screwed up his eyes and paused. “I was searching--and\\r\\ncame here on purpose to do it--for news of the murder of the old\\r\\npawnbroker woman,” he articulated at last, almost in a whisper, bringing\\r\\nhis face exceedingly close to the face of Zametov. Zametov looked at him\\r\\nsteadily, without moving or drawing his face away. What struck Zametov\\r\\nafterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed for\\r\\nexactly a minute, and that they gazed at one another all the while.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What if you have been reading about it?” he cried at last, perplexed\\r\\nand impatient. “That’s no business of mine! What of it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The same old woman,” Raskolnikov went on in the same whisper, not\\r\\nheeding Zametov’s explanation, “about whom you were talking in the\\r\\npolice-office, you remember, when I fainted. Well, do you understand\\r\\nnow?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean? Understand... what?” Zametov brought out, almost\\r\\nalarmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov’s set and earnest face was suddenly transformed, and he\\r\\nsuddenly went off into the same nervous laugh as before, as though\\r\\nutterly unable to restrain himself. And in one flash he recalled with\\r\\nextraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past, that\\r\\nmoment when he stood with the axe behind the door, while the latch\\r\\ntrembled and the men outside swore and shook it, and he had a sudden\\r\\ndesire to shout at them, to swear at them, to put out his tongue at\\r\\nthem, to mock them, to laugh, and laugh, and laugh!\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are either mad, or...” began Zametov, and he broke off, as though\\r\\nstunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Or? Or what? What? Come, tell me!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing,” said Zametov, getting angry, “it’s all nonsense!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth were silent. After his sudden fit of laughter Raskolnikov became\\r\\nsuddenly thoughtful and melancholy. He put his elbow on the table and\\r\\nleaned his head on his hand. He seemed to have completely forgotten\\r\\nZametov. The silence lasted for some time.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why don’t you drink your tea? It’s getting cold,” said Zametov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What! Tea? Oh, yes....” Raskolnikov sipped the glass, put a morsel of\\r\\nbread in his mouth and, suddenly looking at Zametov, seemed to remember\\r\\neverything and pulled himself together. At the same moment his face\\r\\nresumed its original mocking expression. He went on drinking tea.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There have been a great many of these crimes lately,” said Zametov.\\r\\n“Only the other day I read in the _Moscow News_ that a whole gang of\\r\\nfalse coiners had been caught in Moscow. It was a regular society. They\\r\\nused to forge tickets!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, but it was a long time ago! I read about it a month ago,”\\r\\n Raskolnikov answered calmly. “So you consider them criminals?” he added,\\r\\nsmiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course they are criminals.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They? They are children, simpletons, not criminals! Why, half a hundred\\r\\npeople meeting for such an object--what an idea! Three would be too\\r\\nmany, and then they want to have more faith in one another than in\\r\\nthemselves! One has only to blab in his cups and it all collapses.\\r\\nSimpletons! They engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes--what\\r\\na thing to trust to a casual stranger! Well, let us suppose that these\\r\\nsimpletons succeed and each makes a million, and what follows for the\\r\\nrest of their lives? Each is dependent on the others for the rest of his\\r\\nlife! Better hang oneself at once! And they did not know how to change\\r\\nthe notes either; the man who changed the notes took five thousand\\r\\nroubles, and his hands trembled. He counted the first four thousand,\\r\\nbut did not count the fifth thousand--he was in such a hurry to get the\\r\\nmoney into his pocket and run away. Of course he roused suspicion. And\\r\\nthe whole thing came to a crash through one fool! Is it possible?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That his hands trembled?” observed Zametov, “yes, that’s quite\\r\\npossible. That, I feel quite sure, is possible. Sometimes one can’t\\r\\nstand things.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can’t stand that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, could you stand it then? No, I couldn’t. For the sake of a hundred\\r\\nroubles to face such a terrible experience? To go with false notes\\r\\ninto a bank where it’s their business to spot that sort of thing! No, I\\r\\nshould not have the face to do it. Would you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov had an intense desire again “to put his tongue out.” Shivers\\r\\nkept running down his spine.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should do it quite differently,” Raskolnikov began. “This is how I\\r\\nwould change the notes: I’d count the first thousand three or four times\\r\\nbackwards and forwards, looking at every note and then I’d set to the\\r\\nsecond thousand; I’d count that half-way through and then hold some\\r\\nfifty-rouble note to the light, then turn it, then hold it to the light\\r\\nagain--to see whether it was a good one. ‘I am afraid,’ I would say, ‘a\\r\\nrelation of mine lost twenty-five roubles the other day through a\\r\\nfalse note,’ and then I’d tell them the whole story. And after I began\\r\\ncounting the third, ‘No, excuse me,’ I would say, ‘I fancy I made a\\r\\nmistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand, I am not sure.’\\r\\nAnd so I would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and\\r\\nso on to the end. And when I had finished, I’d pick out one from the\\r\\nfifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light\\r\\nand ask again, ‘Change them, please,’ and put the clerk into such a stew\\r\\nthat he would not know how to get rid of me. When I’d finished and had\\r\\ngone out, I’d come back, ‘No, excuse me,’ and ask for some explanation.\\r\\nThat’s how I’d do it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Foo! what terrible things you say!” said Zametov, laughing. “But all\\r\\nthat is only talk. I dare say when it came to deeds you’d make a slip.\\r\\nI believe that even a practised, desperate man cannot always reckon on\\r\\nhimself, much less you and I. To take an example near home--that old\\r\\nwoman murdered in our district. The murderer seems to have been a\\r\\ndesperate fellow, he risked everything in open daylight, was saved by\\r\\na miracle--but his hands shook, too. He did not succeed in robbing the\\r\\nplace, he couldn’t stand it. That was clear from the...”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov seemed offended.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Clear? Why don’t you catch him then?” he cried, maliciously gibing at\\r\\nZametov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, they will catch him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who? You? Do you suppose you could catch him? You’ve a tough job! A\\r\\ngreat point for you is whether a man is spending money or not. If he had\\r\\nno money and suddenly begins spending, he must be the man. So that any\\r\\nchild can mislead you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The fact is they always do that, though,” answered Zametov. “A man will\\r\\ncommit a clever murder at the risk of his life and then at once he goes\\r\\ndrinking in a tavern. They are caught spending money, they are not all\\r\\nas cunning as you are. You wouldn’t go to a tavern, of course?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at Zametov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how I should\\r\\nbehave in that case, too?” he asked with displeasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should like to,” Zametov answered firmly and seriously. Somewhat too\\r\\nmuch earnestness began to appear in his words and looks.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very much?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very much!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right then. This is how I should behave,” Raskolnikov began, again\\r\\nbringing his face close to Zametov’s, again staring at him and speaking\\r\\nin a whisper, so that the latter positively shuddered. “This is what\\r\\nI should have done. I should have taken the money and jewels, I should\\r\\nhave walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place\\r\\nwith fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen, some kitchen garden\\r\\nor place of that sort. I should have looked out beforehand some stone\\r\\nweighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from\\r\\nthe time the house was built. I would lift that stone--there would sure\\r\\nto be a hollow under it, and I would put the jewels and money in that\\r\\nhole. Then I’d roll the stone back so that it would look as before,\\r\\nwould press it down with my foot and walk away. And for a year or two,\\r\\nthree maybe, I would not touch it. And, well, they could search! There’d\\r\\nbe no trace.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a madman,” said Zametov, and for some reason he too spoke in a\\r\\nwhisper, and moved away from Raskolnikov, whose eyes were glittering. He\\r\\nhad turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering.\\r\\nHe bent down as close as possible to Zametov, and his lips began to move\\r\\nwithout uttering a word. This lasted for half a minute; he knew what he\\r\\nwas doing, but could not restrain himself. The terrible word trembled on\\r\\nhis lips, like the latch on that door; in another moment it will break\\r\\nout, in another moment he will let it go, he will speak out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what if it was I who murdered the old woman and Lizaveta?” he said\\r\\nsuddenly and--realised what he had done.\\r\\n\\r\\nZametov looked wildly at him and turned white as the tablecloth. His\\r\\nface wore a contorted smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But is it possible?” he brought out faintly. Raskolnikov looked\\r\\nwrathfully at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Own up that you believed it, yes, you did?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a bit of it, I believe it less than ever now,” Zametov cried\\r\\nhastily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve caught my cock-sparrow! So you did believe it before, if now you\\r\\nbelieve less than ever?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at all,” cried Zametov, obviously embarrassed. “Have you been\\r\\nfrightening me so as to lead up to this?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t believe it then? What were you talking about behind my\\r\\nback when I went out of the police-office? And why did the explosive\\r\\nlieutenant question me after I fainted? Hey, there,” he shouted to the\\r\\nwaiter, getting up and taking his cap, “how much?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thirty copecks,” the latter replied, running up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And there is twenty copecks for vodka. See what a lot of money!” he\\r\\nheld out his shaking hand to Zametov with notes in it. “Red notes and\\r\\nblue, twenty-five roubles. Where did I get them? And where did my new\\r\\nclothes come from? You know I had not a copeck. You’ve cross-examined my\\r\\nlandlady, I’ll be bound.... Well, that’s enough! _Assez causé!_ Till we\\r\\nmeet again!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went out, trembling all over from a sort of wild hysterical\\r\\nsensation, in which there was an element of insufferable rapture. Yet he\\r\\nwas gloomy and terribly tired. His face was twisted as after a fit.\\r\\nHis fatigue increased rapidly. Any shock, any irritating sensation\\r\\nstimulated and revived his energies at once, but his strength failed as\\r\\nquickly when the stimulus was removed.\\r\\n\\r\\nZametov, left alone, sat for a long time in the same place, plunged in\\r\\nthought. Raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain on\\r\\na certain point and had made up his mind for him conclusively.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ilya Petrovitch is a blockhead,” he decided.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restaurant when he\\r\\nstumbled against Razumihin on the steps. They did not see each other\\r\\ntill they almost knocked against each other. For a moment they stood\\r\\nlooking each other up and down. Razumihin was greatly astounded, then\\r\\nanger, real anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So here you are!” he shouted at the top of his voice--“you ran away\\r\\nfrom your bed! And here I’ve been looking for you under the sofa! We\\r\\nwent up to the garret. I almost beat Nastasya on your account. And here\\r\\nhe is after all. Rodya! What is the meaning of it? Tell me the whole\\r\\ntruth! Confess! Do you hear?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It means that I’m sick to death of you all and I want to be alone,”\\r\\n Raskolnikov answered calmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Alone? When you are not able to walk, when your face is as white as a\\r\\nsheet and you are gasping for breath! Idiot!... What have you been doing\\r\\nin the Palais de Cristal? Own up at once!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me go!” said Raskolnikov and tried to pass him. This was too much\\r\\nfor Razumihin; he gripped him firmly by the shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let you go? You dare tell me to let you go? Do you know what I’ll do\\r\\nwith you directly? I’ll pick you up, tie you up in a bundle, carry you\\r\\nhome under my arm and lock you up!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen, Razumihin,” Raskolnikov began quietly, apparently calm--“can’t\\r\\nyou see that I don’t want your benevolence? A strange desire you have to\\r\\nshower benefits on a man who... curses them, who feels them a burden in\\r\\nfact! Why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness? Maybe I\\r\\nwas very glad to die. Didn’t I tell you plainly enough to-day that\\r\\nyou were torturing me, that I was... sick of you! You seem to want to\\r\\ntorture people! I assure you that all that is seriously hindering my\\r\\nrecovery, because it’s continually irritating me. You saw Zossimov\\r\\nwent away just now to avoid irritating me. You leave me alone too, for\\r\\ngoodness’ sake! What right have you, indeed, to keep me by force? Don’t\\r\\nyou see that I am in possession of all my faculties now? How, how can\\r\\nI persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness? I may be\\r\\nungrateful, I may be mean, only let me be, for God’s sake, let me be!\\r\\nLet me be, let me be!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began calmly, gloating beforehand over the venomous phrases he was\\r\\nabout to utter, but finished, panting for breath, in a frenzy, as he had\\r\\nbeen with Luzhin.\\r\\n\\r\\nRazumihin stood a moment, thought and let his hand drop.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, go to hell then,” he said gently and thoughtfully. “Stay,” he\\r\\nroared, as Raskolnikov was about to move. “Listen to me. Let me tell\\r\\nyou, that you are all a set of babbling, posing idiots! If you’ve any\\r\\nlittle trouble you brood over it like a hen over an egg. And you are\\r\\nplagiarists even in that! There isn’t a sign of independent life in\\r\\nyou! You are made of spermaceti ointment and you’ve lymph in your veins\\r\\ninstead of blood. I don’t believe in anyone of you! In any circumstances\\r\\nthe first thing for all of you is to be unlike a human being! Stop!” he\\r\\ncried with redoubled fury, noticing that Raskolnikov was again making\\r\\na movement--“hear me out! You know I’m having a house-warming this\\r\\nevening, I dare say they’ve arrived by now, but I left my uncle there--I\\r\\njust ran in--to receive the guests. And if you weren’t a fool, a common\\r\\nfool, a perfect fool, if you were an original instead of a translation...\\r\\nyou see, Rodya, I recognise you’re a clever fellow, but you’re a\\r\\nfool!--and if you weren’t a fool you’d come round to me this evening\\r\\ninstead of wearing out your boots in the street! Since you have gone\\r\\nout, there’s no help for it! I’d give you a snug easy chair, my landlady\\r\\nhas one... a cup of tea, company.... Or you could lie on the sofa--any\\r\\nway you would be with us.... Zossimov will be there too. Will you come?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“R-rubbish!” Razumihin shouted, out of patience. “How do you know?\\r\\nYou can’t answer for yourself! You don’t know anything about it....\\r\\nThousands of times I’ve fought tooth and nail with people and run back\\r\\nto them afterwards.... One feels ashamed and goes back to a man! So\\r\\nremember, Potchinkov’s house on the third storey....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, Mr. Razumihin, I do believe you’d let anybody beat you from sheer\\r\\nbenevolence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Beat? Whom? Me? I’d twist his nose off at the mere idea! Potchinkov’s\\r\\nhouse, 47, Babushkin’s flat....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall not come, Razumihin.” Raskolnikov turned and walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I bet you will,” Razumihin shouted after him. “I refuse to know you if\\r\\nyou don’t! Stay, hey, is Zametov in there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you see him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Talked to him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What about? Confound you, don’t tell me then. Potchinkov’s house, 47,\\r\\nBabushkin’s flat, remember!”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into Sadovy Street.\\r\\nRazumihin looked after him thoughtfully. Then with a wave of his hand he\\r\\nwent into the house but stopped short of the stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Confound it,” he went on almost aloud. “He talked sensibly but yet...\\r\\nI am a fool! As if madmen didn’t talk sensibly! And this was just what\\r\\nZossimov seemed afraid of.” He struck his finger on his forehead. “What\\r\\nif... how could I let him go off alone? He may drown himself.... Ach,\\r\\nwhat a blunder! I can’t.” And he ran back to overtake Raskolnikov, but\\r\\nthere was no trace of him. With a curse he returned with rapid steps to\\r\\nthe Palais de Cristal to question Zametov.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov walked straight to X---- Bridge, stood in the middle, and\\r\\nleaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance. On parting\\r\\nwith Razumihin, he felt so much weaker that he could scarcely reach this\\r\\nplace. He longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the street. Bending\\r\\nover the water, he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the\\r\\nsunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight, at\\r\\none distant attic window on the left bank, flashing as though on fire in\\r\\nthe last rays of the setting sun, at the darkening water of the canal,\\r\\nand the water seemed to catch his attention. At last red circles flashed\\r\\nbefore his eyes, the houses seemed moving, the passers-by, the canal\\r\\nbanks, the carriages, all danced before his eyes. Suddenly he started,\\r\\nsaved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight. He\\r\\nbecame aware of someone standing on the right side of him; he looked\\r\\nand saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head, with a long, yellow,\\r\\nwasted face and red sunken eyes. She was looking straight at him, but\\r\\nobviously she saw nothing and recognised no one. Suddenly she leaned her\\r\\nright hand on the parapet, lifted her right leg over the railing, then\\r\\nher left and threw herself into the canal. The filthy water parted and\\r\\nswallowed up its victim for a moment, but an instant later the drowning\\r\\nwoman floated to the surface, moving slowly with the current, her head\\r\\nand legs in the water, her skirt inflated like a balloon over her back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A woman drowning! A woman drowning!” shouted dozens of voices; people\\r\\nran up, both banks were thronged with spectators, on the bridge people\\r\\ncrowded about Raskolnikov, pressing up behind him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mercy on it! it’s our Afrosinya!” a woman cried tearfully close by.\\r\\n“Mercy! save her! kind people, pull her out!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A boat, a boat” was shouted in the crowd. But there was no need of a\\r\\nboat; a policeman ran down the steps to the canal, threw off his great\\r\\ncoat and his boots and rushed into the water. It was easy to reach her:\\r\\nshe floated within a couple of yards from the steps, he caught hold of\\r\\nher clothes with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a\\r\\ncomrade held out to him; the drowning woman was pulled out at once. They\\r\\nlaid her on the granite pavement of the embankment. She soon recovered\\r\\nconsciousness, raised her head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing,\\r\\nstupidly wiping her wet dress with her hands. She said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She’s drunk herself out of her senses,” the same woman’s voice wailed\\r\\nat her side. “Out of her senses. The other day she tried to hang\\r\\nherself, we cut her down. I ran out to the shop just now, left my little\\r\\ngirl to look after her--and here she’s in trouble again! A neighbour,\\r\\ngentleman, a neighbour, we live close by, the second house from the end,\\r\\nsee yonder....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crowd broke up. The police still remained round the woman, someone\\r\\nmentioned the police station.... Raskolnikov looked on with a strange\\r\\nsensation of indifference and apathy. He felt disgusted. “No, that’s\\r\\nloathsome... water... it’s not good enough,” he muttered to himself.\\r\\n“Nothing will come of it,” he added, “no use to wait. What about the\\r\\npolice office...? And why isn’t Zametov at the police office? The police\\r\\noffice is open till ten o’clock....” He turned his back to the railing\\r\\nand looked about him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very well then!” he said resolutely; he moved from the bridge and\\r\\nwalked in the direction of the police office. His heart felt hollow and\\r\\nempty. He did not want to think. Even his depression had passed, there\\r\\nwas not a trace now of the energy with which he had set out “to make an\\r\\nend of it all.” Complete apathy had succeeded to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it’s a way out of it,” he thought, walking slowly and listlessly\\r\\nalong the canal bank. “Anyway I’ll make an end, for I want to.... But\\r\\nis it a way out? What does it matter! There’ll be the square yard of\\r\\nspace--ha! But what an end! Is it really the end? Shall I tell them or\\r\\nnot? Ah... damn! How tired I am! If I could find somewhere to sit or lie\\r\\ndown soon! What I am most ashamed of is its being so stupid. But I don’t\\r\\ncare about that either! What idiotic ideas come into one’s head.”\\r\\n\\r\\nTo reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the\\r\\nsecond turning to the left. It was only a few paces away. But at the\\r\\nfirst turning he stopped and, after a minute’s thought, turned into a\\r\\nside street and went two streets out of his way, possibly without any\\r\\nobject, or possibly to delay a minute and gain time. He walked, looking\\r\\nat the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear; he lifted\\r\\nhis head and saw that he was standing at the very gate of _the_ house.\\r\\nHe had not passed it, he had not been near it since _that_ evening.\\r\\nAn overwhelming, unaccountable prompting drew him on. He went into the\\r\\nhouse, passed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on the\\r\\nright, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey.\\r\\nThe narrow, steep staircase was very dark. He stopped at each landing\\r\\nand looked round him with curiosity; on the first landing the framework\\r\\nof the window had been taken out. “That wasn’t so then,” he thought.\\r\\nHere was the flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had been\\r\\nworking. “It’s shut up and the door newly painted. So it’s to let.” Then\\r\\nthe third storey and the fourth. “Here!” He was perplexed to find the\\r\\ndoor of the flat wide open. There were men there, he could hear voices;\\r\\nhe had not expected that. After brief hesitation he mounted the last\\r\\nstairs and went into the flat. It, too, was being done up; there were\\r\\nworkmen in it. This seemed to amaze him; he somehow fancied that he\\r\\nwould find everything as he left it, even perhaps the corpses in the\\r\\nsame places on the floor. And now, bare walls, no furniture; it seemed\\r\\nstrange. He walked to the window and sat down on the window-sill. There\\r\\nwere two workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger than the\\r\\nother. They were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with\\r\\nlilac flowers, instead of the old, dirty, yellow one. Raskolnikov for\\r\\nsome reason felt horribly annoyed by this. He looked at the new paper\\r\\nwith dislike, as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed.\\r\\nThe workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were\\r\\nhurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home. They took\\r\\nno notice of Raskolnikov’s coming in; they were talking. Raskolnikov\\r\\nfolded his arms and listened.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She comes to me in the morning,” said the elder to the younger, “very\\r\\nearly, all dressed up. ‘Why are you preening and prinking?’ says I. ‘I\\r\\nam ready to do anything to please you, Tit Vassilitch!’ That’s a way of\\r\\ngoing on! And she dressed up like a regular fashion book!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what is a fashion book?” the younger one asked. He obviously\\r\\nregarded the other as an authority.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A fashion book is a lot of pictures, coloured, and they come to the\\r\\ntailors here every Saturday, by post from abroad, to show folks how\\r\\nto dress, the male sex as well as the female. They’re pictures. The\\r\\ngentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies’ fluffles,\\r\\nthey’re beyond anything you can fancy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s nothing you can’t find in Petersburg,” the younger cried\\r\\nenthusiastically, “except father and mother, there’s everything!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Except them, there’s everything to be found, my boy,” the elder\\r\\ndeclared sententiously.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box,\\r\\nthe bed, and the chest of drawers had been; the room seemed to him very\\r\\ntiny without furniture in it. The paper was the same; the paper in the\\r\\ncorner showed where the case of ikons had stood. He looked at it and\\r\\nwent to the window. The elder workman looked at him askance.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you want?” he asked suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of answering Raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the\\r\\nbell. The same bell, the same cracked note. He rang it a second and\\r\\na third time; he listened and remembered. The hideous and agonisingly\\r\\nfearful sensation he had felt then began to come back more and more\\r\\nvividly. He shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more\\r\\nsatisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, what do you want? Who are you?” the workman shouted, going out to\\r\\nhim. Raskolnikov went inside again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I want to take a flat,” he said. “I am looking round.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not the time to look at rooms at night! and you ought to come up\\r\\nwith the porter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The floors have been washed, will they be painted?” Raskolnikov went\\r\\non. “Is there no blood?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What blood?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, the old woman and her sister were murdered here. There was a\\r\\nperfect pool there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But who are you?” the workman cried, uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who am I?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You want to know? Come to the police station, I’ll tell you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe workmen looked at him in amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s time for us to go, we are late. Come along, Alyoshka. We must lock\\r\\nup,” said the elder workman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very well, come along,” said Raskolnikov indifferently, and going\\r\\nout first, he went slowly downstairs. “Hey, porter,” he cried in the\\r\\ngateway.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the entrance several people were standing, staring at the passers-by;\\r\\nthe two porters, a peasant woman, a man in a long coat and a few others.\\r\\nRaskolnikov went straight up to them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you want?” asked one of the porters.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you been to the police office?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve just been there. What do you want?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it open?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is the assistant there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He was there for a time. What do you want?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov made no reply, but stood beside them lost in thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s been to look at the flat,” said the elder workman, coming forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Which flat?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where we are at work. ‘Why have you washed away the blood?’ says he.\\r\\n‘There has been a murder here,’ says he, ‘and I’ve come to take it.’\\r\\nAnd he began ringing at the bell, all but broke it. ‘Come to the police\\r\\nstation,’ says he. ‘I’ll tell you everything there.’ He wouldn’t leave\\r\\nus.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe porter looked at Raskolnikov, frowning and perplexed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who are you?” he shouted as impressively as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, formerly a student, I live in\\r\\nShil’s house, not far from here, flat Number 14, ask the porter, he\\r\\nknows me.” Raskolnikov said all this in a lazy, dreamy voice, not\\r\\nturning round, but looking intently into the darkening street.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why have you been to the flat?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To look at it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is there to look at?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Take him straight to the police station,” the man in the long coat\\r\\njerked in abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov looked intently at him over his shoulder and said in the\\r\\nsame slow, lazy tones:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come along.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, take him,” the man went on more confidently. “Why was he going\\r\\ninto _that_, what’s in his mind, eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s not drunk, but God knows what’s the matter with him,” muttered the\\r\\nworkman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what do you want?” the porter shouted again, beginning to get angry\\r\\nin earnest--“Why are you hanging about?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You funk the police station then?” said Raskolnikov jeeringly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How funk it? Why are you hanging about?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s a rogue!” shouted the peasant woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why waste time talking to him?” cried the other porter, a huge peasant\\r\\nin a full open coat and with keys on his belt. “Get along! He is a rogue\\r\\nand no mistake. Get along!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him into the street. He\\r\\nlurched forward, but recovered his footing, looked at the spectators in\\r\\nsilence and walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Strange man!” observed the workman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are strange folks about nowadays,” said the woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You should have taken him to the police station all the same,” said the\\r\\nman in the long coat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Better have nothing to do with him,” decided the big porter. “A regular\\r\\nrogue! Just what he wants, you may be sure, but once take him up, you\\r\\nwon’t get rid of him.... We know the sort!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shall I go there or not?” thought Raskolnikov, standing in the middle\\r\\nof the thoroughfare at the cross-roads, and he looked about him, as\\r\\nthough expecting from someone a decisive word. But no sound came, all\\r\\nwas dead and silent like the stones on which he walked, dead to him, to\\r\\nhim alone.... All at once at the end of the street, two hundred yards\\r\\naway, in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and shouts.\\r\\nIn the middle of the crowd stood a carriage.... A light gleamed in the\\r\\nmiddle of the street. “What is it?” Raskolnikov turned to the right\\r\\nand went up to the crowd. He seemed to clutch at everything and smiled\\r\\ncoldly when he recognised it, for he had fully made up his mind to go to\\r\\nthe police station and knew that it would all soon be over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\nAn elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of\\r\\nspirited grey horses; there was no one in it, and the coachman had got\\r\\noff his box and stood by; the horses were being held by the bridle....\\r\\nA mass of people had gathered round, the police standing in front. One\\r\\nof them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying\\r\\nclose to the wheels. Everyone was talking, shouting, exclaiming; the\\r\\ncoachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating:\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a misfortune! Good Lord, what a misfortune!”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and succeeded at last\\r\\nin seeing the object of the commotion and interest. On the ground a\\r\\nman who had been run over lay apparently unconscious, and covered with\\r\\nblood; he was very badly dressed, but not like a workman. Blood was\\r\\nflowing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated and\\r\\ndisfigured. He was evidently badly injured.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Merciful heaven!” wailed the coachman, “what more could I do? If I’d\\r\\nbeen driving fast or had not shouted to him, but I was going quietly,\\r\\nnot in a hurry. Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody\\r\\nelse. A drunken man can’t walk straight, we all know.... I saw him\\r\\ncrossing the street, staggering and almost falling. I shouted again\\r\\nand a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fell\\r\\nstraight under their feet! Either he did it on purpose or he was very\\r\\ntipsy.... The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started,\\r\\nhe screamed... that made them worse. That’s how it happened!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s just how it was,” a voice in the crowd confirmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He shouted, that’s true, he shouted three times,” another voice\\r\\ndeclared.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Three times it was, we all heard it,” shouted a third.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened. It was\\r\\nevident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who\\r\\nwas awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little\\r\\nanxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements. All they had to do was to\\r\\ntake the injured man to the police station and the hospital. No one knew\\r\\nhis name.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him. The\\r\\nlantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man’s face. He recognised\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know him! I know him!” he shouted, pushing to the front. “It’s a\\r\\ngovernment clerk retired from the service, Marmeladov. He lives close\\r\\nby in Kozel’s house.... Make haste for a doctor! I will pay, see?” He\\r\\npulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was in\\r\\nviolent agitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe police were glad that they had found out who the man was.\\r\\nRaskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, as earnestly as if it\\r\\nhad been his father, he besought the police to carry the unconscious\\r\\nMarmeladov to his lodging at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just here, three houses away,” he said eagerly, “the house belongs to\\r\\nKozel, a rich German. He was going home, no doubt drunk. I know him,\\r\\nhe is a drunkard. He has a family there, a wife, children, he has one\\r\\ndaughter.... It will take time to take him to the hospital, and there is\\r\\nsure to be a doctor in the house. I’ll pay, I’ll pay! At least he will\\r\\nbe looked after at home... they will help him at once. But he’ll die\\r\\nbefore you get him to the hospital.” He managed to slip something\\r\\nunseen into the policeman’s hand. But the thing was straightforward\\r\\nand legitimate, and in any case help was closer here. They raised the\\r\\ninjured man; people volunteered to help.\\r\\n\\r\\nKozel’s house was thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked behind,\\r\\ncarefully holding Marmeladov’s head and showing the way.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This way, this way! We must take him upstairs head foremost. Turn\\r\\nround! I’ll pay, I’ll make it worth your while,” he muttered.\\r\\n\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at every free\\r\\nmoment, walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and\\r\\nback again, with her arms folded across her chest, talking to herself\\r\\nand coughing. Of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest\\r\\ngirl, Polenka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did not\\r\\nunderstand, understood very well that her mother needed her, and so\\r\\nalways watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost\\r\\nto appear to understand. This time Polenka was undressing her little\\r\\nbrother, who had been unwell all day and was going to bed. The boy was\\r\\nwaiting for her to take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night.\\r\\nHe was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent,\\r\\nserious face, with his legs stretched out straight before him--heels\\r\\ntogether and toes turned out.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister, sitting\\r\\nperfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes, just as all good\\r\\nlittle boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed. A little\\r\\ngirl, still younger, dressed literally in rags, stood at the screen,\\r\\nwaiting for her turn. The door on to the stairs was open to relieve\\r\\nthem a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the\\r\\nother rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor,\\r\\nconsumptive woman. Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner\\r\\nduring that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than\\r\\never.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You wouldn’t believe, you can’t imagine, Polenka,” she said, walking\\r\\nabout the room, “what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa’s house\\r\\nand how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin!\\r\\nPapa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that\\r\\neveryone who came to see him said, ‘We look upon you, Ivan Mihailovitch,\\r\\nas our governor!’ When I... when...” she coughed violently, “oh, cursed\\r\\nlife,” she cried, clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her\\r\\nbreast, “when I... when at the last ball... at the marshal’s...\\r\\nPrincess Bezzemelny saw me--who gave me the blessing when your father\\r\\nand I were married, Polenka--she asked at once ‘Isn’t that the pretty\\r\\ngirl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-up?’ (You must mend\\r\\nthat tear, you must take your needle and darn it as I showed you, or\\r\\nto-morrow--cough, cough, cough--he will make the hole bigger,” she\\r\\narticulated with effort.) “Prince Schegolskoy, a kammerjunker, had just\\r\\ncome from Petersburg then... he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to\\r\\nmake me an offer next day; but I thanked him in flattering expressions\\r\\nand told him that my heart had long been another’s. That other was your\\r\\nfather, Polya; papa was fearfully angry.... Is the water ready? Give me\\r\\nthe shirt, and the stockings! Lida,” said she to the youngest one, “you\\r\\nmust manage without your chemise to-night... and lay your stockings out\\r\\nwith it... I’ll wash them together.... How is it that drunken vagabond\\r\\ndoesn’t come in? He has worn his shirt till it looks like a dish-clout,\\r\\nhe has torn it to rags! I’d do it all together, so as not to have to\\r\\nwork two nights running! Oh, dear! (Cough, cough, cough, cough!) Again!\\r\\nWhat’s this?” she cried, noticing a crowd in the passage and the men,\\r\\nwho were pushing into her room, carrying a burden. “What is it? What are\\r\\nthey bringing? Mercy on us!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where are we to put him?” asked the policeman, looking round when\\r\\nMarmeladov, unconscious and covered with blood, had been carried in.\\r\\n\\r\\n“On the sofa! Put him straight on the sofa, with his head this way,”\\r\\n Raskolnikov showed him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Run over in the road! Drunk!” someone shouted in the passage.\\r\\n\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna stood, turning white and gasping for breath. The\\r\\nchildren were terrified. Little Lida screamed, rushed to Polenka and\\r\\nclutched at her, trembling all over.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving laid Marmeladov down, Raskolnikov flew to Katerina Ivanovna.\\r\\n\\r\\n“For God’s sake be calm, don’t be frightened!” he said, speaking\\r\\nquickly, “he was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage, don’t\\r\\nbe frightened, he will come to, I told them bring him here... I’ve been\\r\\nhere already, you remember? He will come to; I’ll pay!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s done it this time!” Katerina Ivanovna cried despairingly and she\\r\\nrushed to her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov noticed at once that she was not one of those women who\\r\\nswoon easily. She instantly placed under the luckless man’s head a\\r\\npillow, which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining\\r\\nhim. She kept her head, forgetting herself, biting her trembling lips\\r\\nand stifling the screams which were ready to break from her.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor. There was a\\r\\ndoctor, it appeared, next door but one.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve sent for a doctor,” he kept assuring Katerina Ivanovna, “don’t be\\r\\nuneasy, I’ll pay. Haven’t you water?... and give me a napkin or a towel,\\r\\nanything, as quick as you can.... He is injured, but not killed, believe\\r\\nme.... We shall see what the doctor says!”\\r\\n\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna ran to the window; there, on a broken chair in the\\r\\ncorner, a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood, in\\r\\nreadiness for washing her children’s and husband’s linen that night.\\r\\nThis washing was done by Katerina Ivanovna at night at least twice a\\r\\nweek, if not oftener. For the family had come to such a pass that they\\r\\nwere practically without change of linen, and Katerina Ivanovna could\\r\\nnot endure uncleanliness and, rather than see dirt in the house, she\\r\\npreferred to wear herself out at night, working beyond her strength when\\r\\nthe rest were asleep, so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry\\r\\nby the morning. She took up the basin of water at Raskolnikov’s request,\\r\\nbut almost fell down with her burden. But the latter had already\\r\\nsucceeded in finding a towel, wetted it and began washing the blood off\\r\\nMarmeladov’s face.\\r\\n\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna stood by, breathing painfully and pressing her hands\\r\\nto her breast. She was in need of attention herself. Raskolnikov began\\r\\nto realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man\\r\\nbrought here. The policeman, too, stood in hesitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Polenka,” cried Katerina Ivanovna, “run to Sonia, make haste. If you\\r\\ndon’t find her at home, leave word that her father has been run over\\r\\nand that she is to come here at once... when she comes in. Run, Polenka!\\r\\nthere, put on the shawl.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Run your fastest!” cried the little boy on the chair suddenly, after\\r\\nwhich he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity, with round eyes, his\\r\\nheels thrust forward and his toes spread out.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldn’t have\\r\\ndropped a pin. The policemen left, all except one, who remained for a\\r\\ntime, trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs. Almost\\r\\nall Madame Lippevechsel’s lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms\\r\\nof the flat; at first they were squeezed together in the doorway, but\\r\\nafterwards they overflowed into the room. Katerina Ivanovna flew into a\\r\\nfury.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You might let him die in peace, at least,” she shouted at the crowd,\\r\\n“is it a spectacle for you to gape at? With cigarettes! (Cough, cough,\\r\\ncough!) You might as well keep your hats on.... And there is one in his\\r\\nhat!... Get away! You should respect the dead, at least!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHer cough choked her--but her reproaches were not without result. They\\r\\nevidently stood in some awe of Katerina Ivanovna. The lodgers, one after\\r\\nanother, squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling\\r\\nof satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden\\r\\naccident, even in those nearest and dearest to the victim, from which\\r\\nno living man is exempt, even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and\\r\\ncompassion.\\r\\n\\r\\nVoices outside were heard, however, speaking of the hospital and saying\\r\\nthat they’d no business to make a disturbance here.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No business to die!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, and she was rushing to\\r\\nthe door to vent her wrath upon them, but in the doorway came face to\\r\\nface with Madame Lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident\\r\\nand ran in to restore order. She was a particularly quarrelsome and\\r\\nirresponsible German.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, my God!” she cried, clasping her hands, “your husband drunken\\r\\nhorses have trampled! To the hospital with him! I am the landlady!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Amalia Ludwigovna, I beg you to recollect what you are saying,”\\r\\n Katerina Ivanovna began haughtily (she always took a haughty tone with\\r\\nthe landlady that she might “remember her place” and even now could not\\r\\ndeny herself this satisfaction). “Amalia Ludwigovna...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have you once before told that you to call me Amalia Ludwigovna may\\r\\nnot dare; I am Amalia Ivanovna.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are not Amalia Ivanovna, but Amalia Ludwigovna, and as I am not\\r\\none of your despicable flatterers like Mr. Lebeziatnikov, who’s laughing\\r\\nbehind the door at this moment (a laugh and a cry of ‘they are at it\\r\\nagain’ was in fact audible at the door) so I shall always call you\\r\\nAmalia Ludwigovna, though I fail to understand why you dislike that\\r\\nname. You can see for yourself what has happened to Semyon Zaharovitch;\\r\\nhe is dying. I beg you to close that door at once and to admit no one.\\r\\nLet him at least die in peace! Or I warn you the Governor-General,\\r\\nhimself, shall be informed of your conduct to-morrow. The prince knew\\r\\nme as a girl; he remembers Semyon Zaharovitch well and has often been\\r\\na benefactor to him. Everyone knows that Semyon Zaharovitch had many\\r\\nfriends and protectors, whom he abandoned himself from an honourable\\r\\npride, knowing his unhappy weakness, but now (she pointed to\\r\\nRaskolnikov) a generous young man has come to our assistance, who has\\r\\nwealth and connections and whom Semyon Zaharovitch has known from a\\r\\nchild. You may rest assured, Amalia Ludwigovna...”\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this was uttered with extreme rapidity, getting quicker and quicker,\\r\\nbut a cough suddenly cut short Katerina Ivanovna’s eloquence. At that\\r\\ninstant the dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan; she\\r\\nran to him. The injured man opened his eyes and without recognition or\\r\\nunderstanding gazed at Raskolnikov who was bending over him. He drew\\r\\ndeep, slow, painful breaths; blood oozed at the corners of his mouth\\r\\nand drops of perspiration came out on his forehead. Not recognising\\r\\nRaskolnikov, he began looking round uneasily. Katerina Ivanovna looked\\r\\nat him with a sad but stern face, and tears trickled from her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My God! His whole chest is crushed! How he is bleeding,” she said\\r\\nin despair. “We must take off his clothes. Turn a little, Semyon\\r\\nZaharovitch, if you can,” she cried to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarmeladov recognised her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A priest,” he articulated huskily.\\r\\n\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna walked to the window, laid her head against the window\\r\\nframe and exclaimed in despair:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, cursed life!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A priest,” the dying man said again after a moment’s silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They’ve gone for him,” Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him, he obeyed her\\r\\nshout and was silent. With sad and timid eyes he looked for her; she\\r\\nreturned and stood by his pillow. He seemed a little easier but not for\\r\\nlong.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite, who was shaking in\\r\\nthe corner, as though she were in a fit, and staring at him with her\\r\\nwondering childish eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A-ah,” he signed towards her uneasily. He wanted to say something.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What now?” cried Katerina Ivanovna.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Barefoot, barefoot!” he muttered, indicating with frenzied eyes the\\r\\nchild’s bare feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Be silent,” Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably, “you know why she is\\r\\nbarefooted.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank God, the doctor,” exclaimed Raskolnikov, relieved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor came in, a precise little old man, a German, looking about\\r\\nhim mistrustfully; he went up to the sick man, took his pulse, carefully\\r\\nfelt his head and with the help of Katerina Ivanovna he unbuttoned the\\r\\nblood-stained shirt, and bared the injured man’s chest. It was gashed,\\r\\ncrushed and fractured, several ribs on the right side were broken.\\r\\nOn the left side, just over the heart, was a large, sinister-looking\\r\\nyellowish-black bruise--a cruel kick from the horse’s hoof. The doctor\\r\\nfrowned. The policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and\\r\\nturned round with it for thirty yards on the road.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s wonderful that he has recovered consciousness,” the doctor\\r\\nwhispered softly to Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you think of him?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He will die immediately.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is there really no hope?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not the faintest! He is at the last gasp.... His head is badly injured,\\r\\ntoo... Hm... I could bleed him if you like, but... it would be useless.\\r\\nHe is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Better bleed him then.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you like.... But I warn you it will be perfectly useless.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the passage parted,\\r\\nand the priest, a little, grey old man, appeared in the doorway bearing\\r\\nthe sacrament. A policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident.\\r\\nThe doctor changed places with him, exchanging glances with him.\\r\\nRaskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while. He shrugged his\\r\\nshoulders and remained.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll stepped back. The confession was soon over. The dying man probably\\r\\nunderstood little; he could only utter indistinct broken sounds.\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna took little Lida, lifted the boy from the chair, knelt\\r\\ndown in the corner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of\\r\\nher. The little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on his\\r\\nlittle bare knees, lifted his hand rhythmically, crossing himself with\\r\\nprecision and bowed down, touching the floor with his forehead, which\\r\\nseemed to afford him especial satisfaction. Katerina Ivanovna bit her\\r\\nlips and held back her tears; she prayed, too, now and then pulling\\r\\nstraight the boy’s shirt, and managed to cover the girl’s bare shoulders\\r\\nwith a kerchief, which she took from the chest without rising from her\\r\\nknees or ceasing to pray. Meanwhile the door from the inner rooms was\\r\\nopened inquisitively again. In the passage the crowd of spectators from\\r\\nall the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser, but they did not\\r\\nventure beyond the threshold. A single candle-end lighted up the scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment Polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door. She\\r\\ncame in panting from running so fast, took off her kerchief, looked for\\r\\nher mother, went up to her and said, “She’s coming, I met her in the\\r\\nstreet.” Her mother made her kneel beside her.\\r\\n\\r\\nTimidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd,\\r\\nand strange was her appearance in that room, in the midst of want, rags,\\r\\ndeath and despair. She, too, was in rags, her attire was all of\\r\\nthe cheapest, but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp,\\r\\nunmistakably betraying its shameful purpose. Sonia stopped short in the\\r\\ndoorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of everything.\\r\\nShe forgot her fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so unseemly here with\\r\\nits ridiculous long train, and her immense crinoline that filled up the\\r\\nwhole doorway, and her light-coloured shoes, and the parasol she brought\\r\\nwith her, though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw hat\\r\\nwith its flaring flame-coloured feather. Under this rakishly-tilted hat\\r\\nwas a pale, frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in\\r\\nterror. Sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair, rather\\r\\npretty, with wonderful blue eyes. She looked intently at the bed and the\\r\\npriest; she too was out of breath with running. At last whispers, some\\r\\nwords in the crowd probably, reached her. She looked down and took a\\r\\nstep forward into the room, still keeping close to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe service was over. Katerina Ivanovna went up to her husband again.\\r\\nThe priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and\\r\\nconsolation to Katerina Ivanovna on leaving.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What am I to do with these?” she interrupted sharply and irritably,\\r\\npointing to the little ones.\\r\\n\\r\\n“God is merciful; look to the Most High for succour,” the priest began.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ach! He is merciful, but not to us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s a sin, a sin, madam,” observed the priest, shaking his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And isn’t that a sin?” cried Katerina Ivanovna, pointing to the dying\\r\\nman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to\\r\\ncompensate you, at least for the loss of his earnings.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t understand!” cried Katerina Ivanovna angrily waving her hand.\\r\\n“And why should they compensate me? Why, he was drunk and threw himself\\r\\nunder the horses! What earnings? He brought us in nothing but misery.\\r\\nHe drank everything away, the drunkard! He robbed us to get drink, he\\r\\nwasted their lives and mine for drink! And thank God he’s dying! One\\r\\nless to keep!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must forgive in the hour of death, that’s a sin, madam, such\\r\\nfeelings are a great sin.”\\r\\n\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna was busy with the dying man; she was giving him water,\\r\\nwiping the blood and sweat from his head, setting his pillow straight,\\r\\nand had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest. Now\\r\\nshe flew at him almost in a frenzy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, father! That’s words and only words! Forgive! If he’d not been run\\r\\nover, he’d have come home to-day drunk and his only shirt dirty and\\r\\nin rags and he’d have fallen asleep like a log, and I should have been\\r\\nsousing and rinsing till daybreak, washing his rags and the children’s\\r\\nand then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight I\\r\\nshould have been darning them. That’s how I spend my nights!... What’s\\r\\nthe use of talking of forgiveness! I have forgiven as it is!”\\r\\n\\r\\nA terrible hollow cough interrupted her words. She put her handkerchief\\r\\nto her lips and showed it to the priest, pressing her other hand to her\\r\\naching chest. The handkerchief was covered with blood. The priest bowed\\r\\nhis head and said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarmeladov was in the last agony; he did not take his eyes off the face\\r\\nof Katerina Ivanovna, who was bending over him again. He kept trying\\r\\nto say something to her; he began moving his tongue with difficulty and\\r\\narticulating indistinctly, but Katerina Ivanovna, understanding that he\\r\\nwanted to ask her forgiveness, called peremptorily to him:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Be silent! No need! I know what you want to say!” And the sick man\\r\\nwas silent, but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the\\r\\ndoorway and he saw Sonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nTill then he had not noticed her: she was standing in the shadow in a\\r\\ncorner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who’s that? Who’s that?” he said suddenly in a thick gasping voice,\\r\\nin agitation, turning his eyes in horror towards the door where his\\r\\ndaughter was standing, and trying to sit up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lie down! Lie do-own!” cried Katerina Ivanovna.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on his\\r\\nelbow. He looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter, as\\r\\nthough not recognising her. He had never seen her before in such attire.\\r\\nSuddenly he recognised her, crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and\\r\\ngaudy finery, meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dying\\r\\nfather. His face showed intense suffering.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sonia! Daughter! Forgive!” he cried, and he tried to hold out his hand\\r\\nto her, but losing his balance, he fell off the sofa, face downwards on\\r\\nthe floor. They rushed to pick him up, they put him on the sofa; but he\\r\\nwas dying. Sonia with a faint cry ran up, embraced him and remained so\\r\\nwithout moving. He died in her arms.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s got what he wanted,” Katerina Ivanovna cried, seeing her husband’s\\r\\ndead body. “Well, what’s to be done now? How am I to bury him! What can\\r\\nI give them to-morrow to eat?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Katerina Ivanovna,” he began, “last week your husband told me all his\\r\\nlife and circumstances.... Believe me, he spoke of you with passionate\\r\\nreverence. From that evening, when I learnt how devoted he was to you\\r\\nall and how he loved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna,\\r\\nin spite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we became\\r\\nfriends.... Allow me now... to do something... to repay my debt to my\\r\\ndead friend. Here are twenty roubles, I think--and if that can be of any\\r\\nassistance to you, then... I... in short, I will come again, I will\\r\\nbe sure to come again... I shall, perhaps, come again to-morrow....\\r\\nGood-bye!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he went quickly out of the room, squeezing his way through the crowd\\r\\nto the stairs. But in the crowd he suddenly jostled against Nikodim\\r\\nFomitch, who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructions\\r\\nin person. They had not met since the scene at the police station, but\\r\\nNikodim Fomitch knew him instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, is that you?” he asked him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s dead,” answered Raskolnikov. “The doctor and the priest have been,\\r\\nall as it should have been. Don’t worry the poor woman too much, she is\\r\\nin consumption as it is. Try and cheer her up, if possible... you are a\\r\\nkind-hearted man, I know...” he added with a smile, looking straight in\\r\\nhis face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you are spattered with blood,” observed Nikodim Fomitch, noticing\\r\\nin the lamplight some fresh stains on Raskolnikov’s waistcoat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes... I’m covered with blood,” Raskolnikov said with a peculiar air;\\r\\nthen he smiled, nodded and went downstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but not conscious\\r\\nof it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and\\r\\nstrength that surged up suddenly within him. This sensation might be\\r\\ncompared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly been\\r\\npardoned. Halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest on\\r\\nhis way home; Raskolnikov let him pass, exchanging a silent greeting\\r\\nwith him. He was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid\\r\\nfootsteps behind him. Someone overtook him; it was Polenka. She was\\r\\nrunning after him, calling “Wait! wait!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned round. She was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped\\r\\nshort a step above him. A dim light came in from the yard. Raskolnikov\\r\\ncould distinguish the child’s thin but pretty little face, looking at\\r\\nhim with a bright childish smile. She had run after him with a message\\r\\nwhich she was evidently glad to give.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell me, what is your name?... and where do you live?” she said\\r\\nhurriedly in a breathless voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort of\\r\\nrapture. It was such a joy to him to look at her, he could not have said\\r\\nwhy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who sent you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sister Sonia sent me,” answered the girl, smiling still more brightly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I knew it was sister Sonia sent you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mamma sent me, too... when sister Sonia was sending me, mamma came up,\\r\\ntoo, and said ‘Run fast, Polenka.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you love sister Sonia?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I love her more than anyone,” Polenka answered with a peculiar\\r\\nearnestness, and her smile became graver.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And will you love me?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBy way of answer he saw the little girl’s face approaching him, her full\\r\\nlips naïvely held out to kiss him. Suddenly her arms as thin as sticks\\r\\nheld him tightly, her head rested on his shoulder and the little girl\\r\\nwept softly, pressing her face against him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sorry for father,” she said a moment later, raising her\\r\\ntear-stained face and brushing away the tears with her hands. “It’s\\r\\nnothing but misfortunes now,” she added suddenly with that peculiarly\\r\\nsedate air which children try hard to assume when they want to speak\\r\\nlike grown-up people.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did your father love you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He loved Lida most,” she went on very seriously without a smile,\\r\\nexactly like grown-up people, “he loved her because she is little and\\r\\nbecause she is ill, too. And he always used to bring her presents. But\\r\\nhe taught us to read and me grammar and scripture, too,” she added with\\r\\ndignity. “And mother never used to say anything, but we knew that she\\r\\nliked it and father knew it, too. And mother wants to teach me French,\\r\\nfor it’s time my education began.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And do you know your prayers?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course, we do! We knew them long ago. I say my prayers to myself\\r\\nas I am a big girl now, but Kolya and Lida say them aloud with mother.\\r\\nFirst they repeat the ‘Ave Maria’ and then another prayer: ‘Lord,\\r\\nforgive and bless sister Sonia,’ and then another, ‘Lord, forgive and\\r\\nbless our second father.’ For our elder father is dead and this is\\r\\nanother one, but we do pray for the other as well.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Polenka, my name is Rodion. Pray sometimes for me, too. ‘And Thy\\r\\nservant Rodion,’ nothing more.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll pray for you all the rest of my life,” the little girl declared\\r\\nhotly, and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him and hugged him\\r\\nwarmly once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to be sure to\\r\\ncome next day. The child went away quite enchanted with him. It was past\\r\\nten when he came out into the street. In five minutes he was standing on\\r\\nthe bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Enough,” he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly. “I’ve done with\\r\\nfancies, imaginary terrors and phantoms! Life is real! haven’t I lived\\r\\njust now? My life has not yet died with that old woman! The Kingdom of\\r\\nHeaven to her--and now enough, madam, leave me in peace! Now for the\\r\\nreign of reason and light... and of will, and of strength... and now\\r\\nwe will see! We will try our strength!” he added defiantly, as though\\r\\nchallenging some power of darkness. “And I was ready to consent to live\\r\\nin a square of space!\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am very weak at this moment, but... I believe my illness is all over.\\r\\nI knew it would be over when I went out. By the way, Potchinkov’s house\\r\\nis only a few steps away. I certainly must go to Razumihin even if\\r\\nit were not close by... let him win his bet! Let us give him some\\r\\nsatisfaction, too--no matter! Strength, strength is what one wants, you\\r\\ncan get nothing without it, and strength must be won by strength--that’s\\r\\nwhat they don’t know,” he added proudly and self-confidently and\\r\\nhe walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge. Pride and\\r\\nself-confidence grew continually stronger in him; he was becoming\\r\\na different man every moment. What was it had happened to work this\\r\\nrevolution in him? He did not know himself; like a man catching at a\\r\\nstraw, he suddenly felt that he, too, ‘could live, that there was still\\r\\nlife for him, that his life had not died with the old woman.’ Perhaps he\\r\\nwas in too great a hurry with his conclusions, but he did not think of\\r\\nthat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I did ask her to remember ‘Thy servant Rodion’ in her prayers,” the\\r\\nidea struck him. “Well, that was... in case of emergency,” he added and\\r\\nlaughed himself at his boyish sally. He was in the best of spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was already known at\\r\\nPotchinkov’s and the porter at once showed him the way. Half-way\\r\\nupstairs he could hear the noise and animated conversation of a big\\r\\ngathering of people. The door was wide open on the stairs; he could\\r\\nhear exclamations and discussion. Razumihin’s room was fairly large; the\\r\\ncompany consisted of fifteen people. Raskolnikov stopped in the entry,\\r\\nwhere two of the landlady’s servants were busy behind a screen with two\\r\\nsamovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie and savouries, brought up\\r\\nfrom the landlady’s kitchen. Raskolnikov sent in for Razumihin. He ran\\r\\nout delighted. At the first glance it was apparent that he had had a\\r\\ngreat deal to drink and, though no amount of liquor made Razumihin quite\\r\\ndrunk, this time he was perceptibly affected by it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen,” Raskolnikov hastened to say, “I’ve only just come to tell you\\r\\nyou’ve won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen to\\r\\nhim. I can’t come in; I am so weak that I shall fall down directly. And\\r\\nso good evening and good-bye! Come and see me to-morrow.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know what? I’ll see you home. If you say you’re weak yourself,\\r\\nyou must...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And your visitors? Who is the curly-headed one who has just peeped\\r\\nout?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He? Goodness only knows! Some friend of uncle’s, I expect, or perhaps\\r\\nhe has come without being invited... I’ll leave uncle with them, he\\r\\nis an invaluable person, pity I can’t introduce you to him now. But\\r\\nconfound them all now! They won’t notice me, and I need a little fresh\\r\\nair, for you’ve come just in the nick of time--another two minutes and I\\r\\nshould have come to blows! They are talking such a lot of wild stuff...\\r\\nyou simply can’t imagine what men will say! Though why shouldn’t you\\r\\nimagine? Don’t we talk nonsense ourselves? And let them... that’s the\\r\\nway to learn not to!... Wait a minute, I’ll fetch Zossimov.”\\r\\n\\r\\nZossimov pounced upon Raskolnikov almost greedily; he showed a special\\r\\ninterest in him; soon his face brightened.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must go to bed at once,” he pronounced, examining the patient as\\r\\nfar as he could, “and take something for the night. Will you take it? I\\r\\ngot it ready some time ago... a powder.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Two, if you like,” answered Raskolnikov. The powder was taken at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a good thing you are taking him home,” observed Zossimov to\\r\\nRazumihin--“we shall see how he is to-morrow, to-day he’s not at all\\r\\namiss--a considerable change since the afternoon. Live and learn...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know what Zossimov whispered to me when we were coming out?”\\r\\n Razumihin blurted out, as soon as they were in the street. “I won’t tell\\r\\nyou everything, brother, because they are such fools. Zossimov told me\\r\\nto talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me, and\\r\\nafterwards I am to tell him about it, for he’s got a notion in his head\\r\\nthat you are... mad or close on it. Only fancy! In the first place,\\r\\nyou’ve three times the brains he has; in the second, if you are not mad,\\r\\nyou needn’t care a hang that he has got such a wild idea; and thirdly,\\r\\nthat piece of beef whose specialty is surgery has gone mad on mental\\r\\ndiseases, and what’s brought him to this conclusion about you was your\\r\\nconversation to-day with Zametov.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Zametov told you all about it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, and he did well. Now I understand what it all means and so does\\r\\nZametov.... Well, the fact is, Rodya... the point is... I am a little\\r\\ndrunk now.... But that’s... no matter... the point is that this\\r\\nidea... you understand? was just being hatched in their brains... you\\r\\nunderstand? That is, no one ventured to say it aloud, because the idea\\r\\nis too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter, that\\r\\nbubble’s burst and gone for ever. But why are they such fools? I gave\\r\\nZametov a bit of a thrashing at the time--that’s between ourselves,\\r\\nbrother; please don’t let out a hint that you know of it; I’ve noticed\\r\\nhe is a ticklish subject; it was at Luise Ivanovna’s. But to-day, to-day\\r\\nit’s all cleared up. That Ilya Petrovitch is at the bottom of it! He\\r\\ntook advantage of your fainting at the police station, but he is ashamed\\r\\nof it himself now; I know that...”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov listened greedily. Razumihin was drunk enough to talk too\\r\\nfreely.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I fainted then because it was so close and the smell of paint,” said\\r\\nRaskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No need to explain that! And it wasn’t the paint only: the fever had\\r\\nbeen coming on for a month; Zossimov testifies to that! But how crushed\\r\\nthat boy is now, you wouldn’t believe! ‘I am not worth his little\\r\\nfinger,’ he says. Yours, he means. He has good feelings at times,\\r\\nbrother. But the lesson, the lesson you gave him to-day in the Palais\\r\\nde Cristal, that was too good for anything! You frightened him at first,\\r\\nyou know, he nearly went into convulsions! You almost convinced\\r\\nhim again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense, and then you\\r\\nsuddenly--put out your tongue at him: ‘There now, what do you make of\\r\\nit?’ It was perfect! He is crushed, annihilated now! It was masterly, by\\r\\nJove, it’s what they deserve! Ah, that I wasn’t there! He was hoping to\\r\\nsee you awfully. Porfiry, too, wants to make your acquaintance...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah!... he too... but why did they put me down as mad?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, not mad. I must have said too much, brother.... What struck him,\\r\\nyou see, was that only that subject seemed to interest you; now it’s\\r\\nclear why it did interest you; knowing all the circumstances... and\\r\\nhow that irritated you and worked in with your illness... I am a little\\r\\ndrunk, brother, only, confound him, he has some idea of his own... I\\r\\ntell you, he’s mad on mental diseases. But don’t you mind him...”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor half a minute both were silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen, Razumihin,” began Raskolnikov, “I want to tell you plainly:\\r\\nI’ve just been at a death-bed, a clerk who died... I gave them all my\\r\\nmoney... and besides I’ve just been kissed by someone who, if I had\\r\\nkilled anyone, would just the same... in fact I saw someone else\\r\\nthere... with a flame-coloured feather... but I am talking nonsense; I\\r\\nam very weak, support me... we shall be at the stairs directly...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s the matter? What’s the matter with you?” Razumihin asked\\r\\nanxiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am a little giddy, but that’s not the point, I am so sad, so sad...\\r\\nlike a woman. Look, what’s that? Look, look!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you see? A light in my room, you see? Through the crack...”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs, at the level\\r\\nof the landlady’s door, and they could, as a fact, see from below that\\r\\nthere was a light in Raskolnikov’s garret.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Queer! Nastasya, perhaps,” observed Razumihin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She is never in my room at this time and she must be in bed long ago,\\r\\nbut... I don’t care! Good-bye!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean? I am coming with you, we’ll come in together!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know we are going in together, but I want to shake hands here and say\\r\\ngood-bye to you here. So give me your hand, good-bye!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s the matter with you, Rodya?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing... come along... you shall be witness.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey began mounting the stairs, and the idea struck Razumihin that\\r\\nperhaps Zossimov might be right after all. “Ah, I’ve upset him with my\\r\\nchatter!” he muttered to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they reached the door they heard voices in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?” cried Razumihin. Raskolnikov was the first to open the\\r\\ndoor; he flung it wide and stood still in the doorway, dumbfoundered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting an\\r\\nhour and a half for him. Why had he never expected, never thought of\\r\\nthem, though the news that they had started, were on their way and would\\r\\narrive immediately, had been repeated to him only that day? They had\\r\\nspent that hour and a half plying Nastasya with questions. She was\\r\\nstanding before them and had told them everything by now. They were\\r\\nbeside themselves with alarm when they heard of his “running away”\\r\\n to-day, ill and, as they understood from her story, delirious! “Good\\r\\nHeavens, what had become of him?” Both had been weeping, both had been\\r\\nin anguish for that hour and a half.\\r\\n\\r\\nA cry of joy, of ecstasy, greeted Raskolnikov’s entrance. Both rushed to\\r\\nhim. But he stood like one dead; a sudden intolerable sensation struck\\r\\nhim like a thunderbolt. He did not lift his arms to embrace them, he\\r\\ncould not. His mother and sister clasped him in their arms, kissed him,\\r\\nlaughed and cried. He took a step, tottered and fell to the ground,\\r\\nfainting.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnxiety, cries of horror, moans... Razumihin who was standing in the\\r\\ndoorway flew into the room, seized the sick man in his strong arms and\\r\\nin a moment had him on the sofa.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s nothing, nothing!” he cried to the mother and sister--“it’s only a\\r\\nfaint, a mere trifle! Only just now the doctor said he was much better,\\r\\nthat he is perfectly well! Water! See, he is coming to himself, he is\\r\\nall right again!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd seizing Dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it, he made\\r\\nher bend down to see that “he is all right again.” The mother and sister\\r\\nlooked on him with emotion and gratitude, as their Providence. They\\r\\nhad heard already from Nastasya all that had been done for their Rodya\\r\\nduring his illness, by this “very competent young man,” as Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna Raskolnikov called him that evening in conversation with\\r\\nDounia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART III\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov got up, and sat down on the sofa. He waved his hand weakly\\r\\nto Razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations\\r\\nhe was addressing to his mother and sister, took them both by the hand\\r\\nand for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking.\\r\\nHis mother was alarmed by his expression. It revealed an emotion\\r\\nagonisingly poignant, and at the same time something immovable, almost\\r\\ninsane. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.\\r\\n\\r\\nAvdotya Romanovna was pale; her hand trembled in her brother’s.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go home... with him,” he said in a broken voice, pointing to Razumihin,\\r\\n“good-bye till to-morrow; to-morrow everything... Is it long since you\\r\\narrived?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This evening, Rodya,” answered Pulcheria Alexandrovna, “the train was\\r\\nawfully late. But, Rodya, nothing would induce me to leave you now! I\\r\\nwill spend the night here, near you...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t torture me!” he said with a gesture of irritation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will stay with him,” cried Razumihin, “I won’t leave him for a\\r\\nmoment. Bother all my visitors! Let them rage to their hearts’ content!\\r\\nMy uncle is presiding there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How, how can I thank you!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna was beginning, once\\r\\nmore pressing Razumihin’s hands, but Raskolnikov interrupted her again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t have it! I can’t have it!” he repeated irritably, “don’t worry\\r\\nme! Enough, go away... I can’t stand it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, mamma, come out of the room at least for a minute,” Dounia\\r\\nwhispered in dismay; “we are distressing him, that’s evident.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mayn’t I look at him after three years?” wept Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stay,” he stopped them again, “you keep interrupting me, and my ideas\\r\\nget muddled.... Have you seen Luzhin?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, Rodya, but he knows already of our arrival. We have heard, Rodya,\\r\\nthat Pyotr Petrovitch was so kind as to visit you today,” Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna added somewhat timidly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes... he was so kind... Dounia, I promised Luzhin I’d throw him\\r\\ndownstairs and told him to go to hell....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rodya, what are you saying! Surely, you don’t mean to tell us...”\\r\\n Pulcheria Alexandrovna began in alarm, but she stopped, looking at\\r\\nDounia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAvdotya Romanovna was looking attentively at her brother, waiting\\r\\nfor what would come next. Both of them had heard of the quarrel from\\r\\nNastasya, so far as she had succeeded in understanding and reporting it,\\r\\nand were in painful perplexity and suspense.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dounia,” Raskolnikov continued with an effort, “I don’t want that\\r\\nmarriage, so at the first opportunity to-morrow you must refuse Luzhin,\\r\\nso that we may never hear his name again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good Heavens!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Brother, think what you are saying!” Avdotya Romanovna began\\r\\nimpetuously, but immediately checked herself. “You are not fit to talk\\r\\nnow, perhaps; you are tired,” she added gently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You think I am delirious? No... You are marrying Luzhin for _my_\\r\\nsake. But I won’t accept the sacrifice. And so write a letter before\\r\\nto-morrow, to refuse him... Let me read it in the morning and that will\\r\\nbe the end of it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That I can’t do!” the girl cried, offended, “what right have you...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dounia, you are hasty, too, be quiet, to-morrow... Don’t you see...”\\r\\n the mother interposed in dismay. “Better come away!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is raving,” Razumihin cried tipsily, “or how would he dare!\\r\\nTo-morrow all this nonsense will be over... to-day he certainly did\\r\\ndrive him away. That was so. And Luzhin got angry, too.... He made\\r\\nspeeches here, wanted to show off his learning and he went out\\r\\ncrest-fallen....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then it’s true?” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-bye till to-morrow, brother,” said Dounia compassionately--“let us\\r\\ngo, mother... Good-bye, Rodya.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you hear, sister,” he repeated after them, making a last effort,\\r\\n“I am not delirious; this marriage is--an infamy. Let me act like\\r\\na scoundrel, but you mustn’t... one is enough... and though I am a\\r\\nscoundrel, I wouldn’t own such a sister. It’s me or Luzhin! Go now....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you’re out of your mind! Despot!” roared Razumihin; but Raskolnikov\\r\\ndid not and perhaps could not answer. He lay down on the sofa, and\\r\\nturned to the wall, utterly exhausted. Avdotya Romanovna looked with\\r\\ninterest at Razumihin; her black eyes flashed; Razumihin positively\\r\\nstarted at her glance.\\r\\n\\r\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna stood overwhelmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing would induce me to go,” she whispered in despair to Razumihin.\\r\\n“I will stay somewhere here... escort Dounia home.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll spoil everything,” Razumihin answered in the same whisper,\\r\\nlosing patience--“come out on to the stairs, anyway. Nastasya, show a\\r\\nlight! I assure you,” he went on in a half whisper on the stairs--“that\\r\\nhe was almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon! Do you\\r\\nunderstand? The doctor himself! Even he gave way and left him, so as not\\r\\nto irritate him. I remained downstairs on guard, but he dressed at once\\r\\nand slipped off. And he will slip off again if you irritate him, at this\\r\\ntime of night, and will do himself some mischief....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you saying?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And Avdotya Romanovna can’t possibly be left in those lodgings without\\r\\nyou. Just think where you are staying! That blackguard Pyotr Petrovitch\\r\\ncouldn’t find you better lodgings... But you know I’ve had a little to\\r\\ndrink, and that’s what makes me... swear; don’t mind it....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I’ll go to the landlady here,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna insisted,\\r\\n“I’ll beseech her to find some corner for Dounia and me for the night. I\\r\\ncan’t leave him like that, I cannot!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis conversation took place on the landing just before the landlady’s\\r\\ndoor. Nastasya lighted them from a step below. Razumihin was in\\r\\nextraordinary excitement. Half an hour earlier, while he was bringing\\r\\nRaskolnikov home, he had indeed talked too freely, but he was aware of\\r\\nit himself, and his head was clear in spite of the vast quantities he\\r\\nhad imbibed. Now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy, and all that he\\r\\nhad drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect. He stood with\\r\\nthe two ladies, seizing both by their hands, persuading them, and giving\\r\\nthem reasons with astonishing plainness of speech, and at almost every\\r\\nword he uttered, probably to emphasise his arguments, he squeezed their\\r\\nhands painfully as in a vise. He stared at Avdotya Romanovna without the\\r\\nleast regard for good manners. They sometimes pulled their hands out of\\r\\nhis huge bony paws, but far from noticing what was the matter, he drew\\r\\nthem all the closer to him. If they’d told him to jump head foremost\\r\\nfrom the staircase, he would have done it without thought or hesitation\\r\\nin their service. Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna felt that the young man\\r\\nwas really too eccentric and pinched her hand too much, in her anxiety\\r\\nover her Rodya she looked on his presence as providential, and was\\r\\nunwilling to notice all his peculiarities. But though Avdotya Romanovna\\r\\nshared her anxiety, and was not of timorous disposition, she could not\\r\\nsee the glowing light in his eyes without wonder and almost alarm. It\\r\\nwas only the unbounded confidence inspired by Nastasya’s account of her\\r\\nbrother’s queer friend, which prevented her from trying to run away from\\r\\nhim, and to persuade her mother to do the same. She realised, too,\\r\\nthat even running away was perhaps impossible now. Ten minutes later,\\r\\nhowever, she was considerably reassured; it was characteristic of\\r\\nRazumihin that he showed his true nature at once, whatever mood he might\\r\\nbe in, so that people quickly saw the sort of man they had to deal with.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can’t go to the landlady, that’s perfect nonsense!” he cried. “If\\r\\nyou stay, though you are his mother, you’ll drive him to a frenzy, and\\r\\nthen goodness knows what will happen! Listen, I’ll tell you what I’ll\\r\\ndo: Nastasya will stay with him now, and I’ll conduct you both home, you\\r\\ncan’t be in the streets alone; Petersburg is an awful place in that\\r\\nway.... But no matter! Then I’ll run straight back here and a quarter of\\r\\nan hour later, on my word of honour, I’ll bring you news how he is,\\r\\nwhether he is asleep, and all that. Then, listen! Then I’ll run home in\\r\\na twinkling--I’ve a lot of friends there, all drunk--I’ll fetch\\r\\nZossimov--that’s the doctor who is looking after him, he is there, too,\\r\\nbut he is not drunk; he is not drunk, he is never drunk! I’ll drag him\\r\\nto Rodya, and then to you, so that you’ll get two reports in the\\r\\nhour--from the doctor, you understand, from the doctor himself, that’s a\\r\\nvery different thing from my account of him! If there’s anything wrong,\\r\\nI swear I’ll bring you here myself, but, if it’s all right, you go to\\r\\nbed. And I’ll spend the night here, in the passage, he won’t hear me,\\r\\nand I’ll tell Zossimov to sleep at the landlady’s, to be at hand. Which\\r\\nis better for him: you or the doctor? So come home then! But the\\r\\nlandlady is out of the question; it’s all right for me, but it’s out of\\r\\nthe question for you: she wouldn’t take you, for she’s... for she’s a\\r\\nfool... She’d be jealous on my account of Avdotya Romanovna and of you,\\r\\ntoo, if you want to know... of Avdotya Romanovna certainly. She is an\\r\\nabsolutely, absolutely unaccountable character! But I am a fool, too!...\\r\\nNo matter! Come along! Do you trust me? Come, do you trust me or not?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let us go, mother,” said Avdotya Romanovna, “he will certainly do what\\r\\nhe has promised. He has saved Rodya already, and if the doctor really\\r\\nwill consent to spend the night here, what could be better?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You see, you... you... understand me, because you are an angel!”\\r\\n Razumihin cried in ecstasy, “let us go! Nastasya! Fly upstairs and sit\\r\\nwith him with a light; I’ll come in a quarter of an hour.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Pulcheria Alexandrovna was not perfectly convinced, she made no\\r\\nfurther resistance. Razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down\\r\\nthe stairs. He still made her uneasy, as though he was competent and\\r\\ngood-natured, was he capable of carrying out his promise? He seemed in\\r\\nsuch a condition....\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, I see you think I am in such a condition!” Razumihin broke in upon\\r\\nher thoughts, guessing them, as he strolled along the pavement with huge\\r\\nsteps, so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him, a fact he\\r\\ndid not observe, however. “Nonsense! That is... I am drunk like a fool,\\r\\nbut that’s not it; I am not drunk from wine. It’s seeing you has turned\\r\\nmy head... But don’t mind me! Don’t take any notice: I am talking\\r\\nnonsense, I am not worthy of you.... I am utterly unworthy of you! The\\r\\nminute I’ve taken you home, I’ll pour a couple of pailfuls of water over\\r\\nmy head in the gutter here, and then I shall be all right.... If only\\r\\nyou knew how I love you both! Don’t laugh, and don’t be angry! You may\\r\\nbe angry with anyone, but not with me! I am his friend, and therefore I\\r\\nam your friend, too, I want to be... I had a presentiment... Last year\\r\\nthere was a moment... though it wasn’t a presentiment really, for\\r\\nyou seem to have fallen from heaven. And I expect I shan’t sleep all\\r\\nnight... Zossimov was afraid a little time ago that he would go mad...\\r\\nthat’s why he mustn’t be irritated.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you say?” cried the mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did the doctor really say that?” asked Avdotya Romanovna, alarmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, but it’s not so, not a bit of it. He gave him some medicine, a\\r\\npowder, I saw it, and then your coming here.... Ah! It would have been\\r\\nbetter if you had come to-morrow. It’s a good thing we went away. And in\\r\\nan hour Zossimov himself will report to you about everything. He is not\\r\\ndrunk! And I shan’t be drunk.... And what made me get so tight? Because\\r\\nthey got me into an argument, damn them! I’ve sworn never to argue! They\\r\\ntalk such trash! I almost came to blows! I’ve left my uncle to preside.\\r\\nWould you believe, they insist on complete absence of individualism\\r\\nand that’s just what they relish! Not to be themselves, to be as unlike\\r\\nthemselves as they can. That’s what they regard as the highest point of\\r\\nprogress. If only their nonsense were their own, but as it is...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna interrupted timidly, but it only added\\r\\nfuel to the flames.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you think?” shouted Razumihin, louder than ever, “you think I\\r\\nam attacking them for talking nonsense? Not a bit! I like them to talk\\r\\nnonsense. That’s man’s one privilege over all creation. Through error\\r\\nyou come to the truth! I am a man because I err! You never reach any\\r\\ntruth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and\\r\\nfourteen. And a fine thing, too, in its way; but we can’t even make\\r\\nmistakes on our own account! Talk nonsense, but talk your own nonsense,\\r\\nand I’ll kiss you for it. To go wrong in one’s own way is better than\\r\\nto go right in someone else’s. In the first case you are a man, in the\\r\\nsecond you’re no better than a bird. Truth won’t escape you, but life\\r\\ncan be cramped. There have been examples. And what are we doing now?\\r\\nIn science, development, thought, invention, ideals, aims, liberalism,\\r\\njudgment, experience and everything, everything, everything, we are\\r\\nstill in the preparatory class at school. We prefer to live on other\\r\\npeople’s ideas, it’s what we are used to! Am I right, am I right?” cried\\r\\nRazumihin, pressing and shaking the two ladies’ hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, mercy, I do not know,” cried poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes... though I don’t agree with you in everything,” added Avdotya\\r\\nRomanovna earnestly and at once uttered a cry, for he squeezed her hand\\r\\nso painfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, you say yes... well after that you... you...” he cried in\\r\\na transport, “you are a fount of goodness, purity, sense... and\\r\\nperfection. Give me your hand... you give me yours, too! I want to kiss\\r\\nyour hands here at once, on my knees...” and he fell on his knees on the\\r\\npavement, fortunately at that time deserted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Leave off, I entreat you, what are you doing?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\\r\\ncried, greatly distressed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get up, get up!” said Dounia laughing, though she, too, was upset.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not for anything till you let me kiss your hands! That’s it! Enough! I\\r\\nget up and we’ll go on! I am a luckless fool, I am unworthy of you and\\r\\ndrunk... and I am ashamed.... I am not worthy to love you, but to do\\r\\nhomage to you is the duty of every man who is not a perfect beast! And\\r\\nI’ve done homage.... Here are your lodgings, and for that alone Rodya\\r\\nwas right in driving your Pyotr Petrovitch away.... How dare he! how\\r\\ndare he put you in such lodgings! It’s a scandal! Do you know the\\r\\nsort of people they take in here? And you his betrothed! You are\\r\\nhis betrothed? Yes? Well, then, I’ll tell you, your _fiancé_ is a\\r\\nscoundrel.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me, Mr. Razumihin, you are forgetting...” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\\r\\nwas beginning.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes, you are right, I did forget myself, I am ashamed of it,”\\r\\n Razumihin made haste to apologise. “But... but you can’t be angry with\\r\\nme for speaking so! For I speak sincerely and not because... hm, hm!\\r\\nThat would be disgraceful; in fact not because I’m in... hm! Well,\\r\\nanyway, I won’t say why, I daren’t.... But we all saw to-day when he\\r\\ncame in that that man is not of our sort. Not because he had his hair\\r\\ncurled at the barber’s, not because he was in such a hurry to show his\\r\\nwit, but because he is a spy, a speculator, because he is a skin-flint\\r\\nand a buffoon. That’s evident. Do you think him clever? No, he is a\\r\\nfool, a fool. And is he a match for you? Good heavens! Do you see,\\r\\nladies?” he stopped suddenly on the way upstairs to their rooms, “though\\r\\nall my friends there are drunk, yet they are all honest, and though we\\r\\ndo talk a lot of trash, and I do, too, yet we shall talk our way to the\\r\\ntruth at last, for we are on the right path, while Pyotr Petrovitch...\\r\\nis not on the right path. Though I’ve been calling them all sorts of\\r\\nnames just now, I do respect them all... though I don’t respect Zametov,\\r\\nI like him, for he is a puppy, and that bullock Zossimov, because he\\r\\nis an honest man and knows his work. But enough, it’s all said and\\r\\nforgiven. Is it forgiven? Well, then, let’s go on. I know this corridor,\\r\\nI’ve been here, there was a scandal here at Number 3.... Where are you\\r\\nhere? Which number? eight? Well, lock yourselves in for the night, then.\\r\\nDon’t let anybody in. In a quarter of an hour I’ll come back with news,\\r\\nand half an hour later I’ll bring Zossimov, you’ll see! Good-bye, I’ll\\r\\nrun.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens, Dounia, what is going to happen?” said Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna, addressing her daughter with anxiety and dismay.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t worry yourself, mother,” said Dounia, taking off her hat and\\r\\ncape. “God has sent this gentleman to our aid, though he has come from a\\r\\ndrinking party. We can depend on him, I assure you. And all that he has\\r\\ndone for Rodya....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah. Dounia, goodness knows whether he will come! How could I bring\\r\\nmyself to leave Rodya?... And how different, how different I had fancied\\r\\nour meeting! How sullen he was, as though not pleased to see us....”\\r\\n\\r\\nTears came into her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, it’s not that, mother. You didn’t see, you were crying all the\\r\\ntime. He is quite unhinged by serious illness--that’s the reason.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, that illness! What will happen, what will happen? And how he talked\\r\\nto you, Dounia!” said the mother, looking timidly at her daughter,\\r\\ntrying to read her thoughts and, already half consoled by Dounia’s\\r\\nstanding up for her brother, which meant that she had already forgiven\\r\\nhim. “I am sure he will think better of it to-morrow,” she added,\\r\\nprobing her further.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And I am sure that he will say the same to-morrow... about that,”\\r\\n Avdotya Romanovna said finally. And, of course, there was no going\\r\\nbeyond that, for this was a point which Pulcheria Alexandrovna was\\r\\nafraid to discuss. Dounia went up and kissed her mother. The latter\\r\\nwarmly embraced her without speaking. Then she sat down to wait\\r\\nanxiously for Razumihin’s return, timidly watching her daughter who\\r\\nwalked up and down the room with her arms folded, lost in thought.\\r\\nThis walking up and down when she was thinking was a habit of Avdotya\\r\\nRomanovna’s and the mother was always afraid to break in on her\\r\\ndaughter’s mood at such moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nRazumihin, of course, was ridiculous in his sudden drunken infatuation\\r\\nfor Avdotya Romanovna. Yet apart from his eccentric condition, many\\r\\npeople would have thought it justified if they had seen Avdotya\\r\\nRomanovna, especially at that moment when she was walking to and\\r\\nfro with folded arms, pensive and melancholy. Avdotya Romanovna was\\r\\nremarkably good-looking; she was tall, strikingly well-proportioned,\\r\\nstrong and self-reliant--the latter quality was apparent in every\\r\\ngesture, though it did not in the least detract from the grace and\\r\\nsoftness of her movements. In face she resembled her brother, but she\\r\\nmight be described as really beautiful. Her hair was dark brown, a\\r\\nlittle lighter than her brother’s; there was a proud light in her almost\\r\\nblack eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness. She was\\r\\npale, but it was a healthy pallor; her face was radiant with freshness\\r\\nand vigour. Her mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip projected\\r\\na little as did her chin; it was the only irregularity in her beautiful\\r\\nface, but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty\\r\\nexpression. Her face was always more serious and thoughtful than gay;\\r\\nbut how well smiles, how well youthful, lighthearted, irresponsible,\\r\\nlaughter suited her face! It was natural enough that a warm, open,\\r\\nsimple-hearted, honest giant like Razumihin, who had never seen anyone\\r\\nlike her and was not quite sober at the time, should lose his head\\r\\nimmediately. Besides, as chance would have it, he saw Dounia for the\\r\\nfirst time transfigured by her love for her brother and her joy at\\r\\nmeeting him. Afterwards he saw her lower lip quiver with indignation\\r\\nat her brother’s insolent, cruel and ungrateful words--and his fate was\\r\\nsealed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had spoken the truth, moreover, when he blurted out in his drunken\\r\\ntalk on the stairs that Praskovya Pavlovna, Raskolnikov’s eccentric\\r\\nlandlady, would be jealous of Pulcheria Alexandrovna as well as of\\r\\nAvdotya Romanovna on his account. Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was\\r\\nforty-three, her face still retained traces of her former beauty; she\\r\\nlooked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost always the\\r\\ncase with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure\\r\\nsincere warmth of heart to old age. We may add in parenthesis that to\\r\\npreserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old age. Her\\r\\nhair had begun to grow grey and thin, there had long been little crow’s\\r\\nfoot wrinkles round her eyes, her cheeks were hollow and sunken from\\r\\nanxiety and grief, and yet it was a handsome face. She was Dounia\\r\\nover again, twenty years older, but without the projecting underlip.\\r\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was emotional, but not sentimental, timid and\\r\\nyielding, but only to a certain point. She could give way and accept a\\r\\ngreat deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, but there was a\\r\\ncertain barrier fixed by honesty, principle and the deepest convictions\\r\\nwhich nothing would induce her to cross.\\r\\n\\r\\nExactly twenty minutes after Razumihin’s departure, there came two\\r\\nsubdued but hurried knocks at the door: he had come back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I won’t come in, I haven’t time,” he hastened to say when the door was\\r\\nopened. “He sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, and God grant he may\\r\\nsleep ten hours. Nastasya’s with him; I told her not to leave till I\\r\\ncame. Now I am fetching Zossimov, he will report to you and then you’d\\r\\nbetter turn in; I can see you are too tired to do anything....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he ran off down the corridor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a very competent and... devoted young man!” cried Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna exceedingly delighted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He seems a splendid person!” Avdotya Romanovna replied with some\\r\\nwarmth, resuming her walk up and down the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridor\\r\\nand another knock at the door. Both women waited this time completely\\r\\nrelying on Razumihin’s promise; he actually had succeeded in bringing\\r\\nZossimov. Zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to\\r\\ngo to Raskolnikov’s, but he came reluctantly and with the greatest\\r\\nsuspicion to see the ladies, mistrusting Razumihin in his exhilarated\\r\\ncondition. But his vanity was at once reassured and flattered; he saw\\r\\nthat they were really expecting him as an oracle. He stayed just ten\\r\\nminutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna. He spoke with marked sympathy, but with the reserve and\\r\\nextreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation.\\r\\nHe did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the\\r\\nslightest desire to enter into more personal relations with the two\\r\\nladies. Remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of Avdotya\\r\\nRomanovna, he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit and\\r\\naddressed himself solely to Pulcheria Alexandrovna. All this gave him\\r\\nextraordinary inward satisfaction. He declared that he thought the\\r\\ninvalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily. According to his\\r\\nobservations the patient’s illness was due partly to his unfortunate\\r\\nmaterial surroundings during the last few months, but it had partly also\\r\\na moral origin, “was, so to speak, the product of several material and\\r\\nmoral influences, anxieties, apprehensions, troubles, certain ideas...\\r\\nand so on.” Noticing stealthily that Avdotya Romanovna was following his\\r\\nwords with close attention, Zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this\\r\\ntheme. On Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s anxiously and timidly inquiring as\\r\\nto “some suspicion of insanity,” he replied with a composed and candid\\r\\nsmile that his words had been exaggerated; that certainly the patient\\r\\nhad some fixed idea, something approaching a monomania--he, Zossimov,\\r\\nwas now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine--but\\r\\nthat it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been in\\r\\ndelirium and... and that no doubt the presence of his family would have\\r\\na favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind, “if only all\\r\\nfresh shocks can be avoided,” he added significantly. Then he got up,\\r\\ntook leave with an impressive and affable bow, while blessings, warm\\r\\ngratitude, and entreaties were showered upon him, and Avdotya Romanovna\\r\\nspontaneously offered her hand to him. He went out exceedingly pleased\\r\\nwith his visit and still more so with himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ll talk to-morrow; go to bed at once!” Razumihin said in conclusion,\\r\\nfollowing Zossimov out. “I’ll be with you to-morrow morning as early as\\r\\npossible with my report.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s a fetching little girl, Avdotya Romanovna,” remarked Zossimov,\\r\\nalmost licking his lips as they both came out into the street.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fetching? You said fetching?” roared Razumihin and he flew at Zossimov\\r\\nand seized him by the throat. “If you ever dare.... Do you understand?\\r\\nDo you understand?” he shouted, shaking him by the collar and squeezing\\r\\nhim against the wall. “Do you hear?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me go, you drunken devil,” said Zossimov, struggling and when he\\r\\nhad let him go, he stared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw.\\r\\nRazumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course, I am an ass,” he observed, sombre as a storm cloud, “but\\r\\nstill... you are another.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, brother, not at all such another. I am not dreaming of any folly.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked along in silence and only when they were close to\\r\\nRaskolnikov’s lodgings, Razumihin broke the silence in considerable\\r\\nanxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen,” he said, “you’re a first-rate fellow, but among your other\\r\\nfailings, you’re a loose fish, that I know, and a dirty one, too. You\\r\\nare a feeble, nervous wretch, and a mass of whims, you’re getting fat\\r\\nand lazy and can’t deny yourself anything--and I call that dirty because\\r\\nit leads one straight into the dirt. You’ve let yourself get so slack\\r\\nthat I don’t know how it is you are still a good, even a devoted doctor.\\r\\nYou--a doctor--sleep on a feather bed and get up at night to your\\r\\npatients! In another three or four years you won’t get up for your\\r\\npatients... But hang it all, that’s not the point!... You are going\\r\\nto spend to-night in the landlady’s flat here. (Hard work I’ve had to\\r\\npersuade her!) And I’ll be in the kitchen. So here’s a chance for you to\\r\\nget to know her better.... It’s not as you think! There’s not a trace of\\r\\nanything of the sort, brother...!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I don’t think!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here you have modesty, brother, silence, bashfulness, a savage\\r\\nvirtue... and yet she’s sighing and melting like wax, simply melting!\\r\\nSave me from her, by all that’s unholy! She’s most prepossessing... I’ll\\r\\nrepay you, I’ll do anything....”\\r\\n\\r\\nZossimov laughed more violently than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you are smitten! But what am I to do with her?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It won’t be much trouble, I assure you. Talk any rot you like to her,\\r\\nas long as you sit by her and talk. You’re a doctor, too; try curing\\r\\nher of something. I swear you won’t regret it. She has a piano, and you\\r\\nknow, I strum a little. I have a song there, a genuine Russian one: ‘I\\r\\nshed hot tears.’ She likes the genuine article--and well, it all\\r\\nbegan with that song; Now you’re a regular performer, a _maître_, a\\r\\nRubinstein.... I assure you, you won’t regret it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But have you made her some promise? Something signed? A promise of\\r\\nmarriage, perhaps?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing of the kind! Besides she is not\\r\\nthat sort at all.... Tchebarov tried that....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well then, drop her!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I can’t drop her like that!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why can’t you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I can’t, that’s all about it! There’s an element of attraction\\r\\nhere, brother.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then why have you fascinated her?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I haven’t fascinated her; perhaps I was fascinated myself in my folly.\\r\\nBut she won’t care a straw whether it’s you or I, so long as somebody\\r\\nsits beside her, sighing.... I can’t explain the position, brother...\\r\\nlook here, you are good at mathematics, and working at it now... begin\\r\\nteaching her the integral calculus; upon my soul, I’m not joking, I’m\\r\\nin earnest, it’ll be just the same to her. She will gaze at you and sigh\\r\\nfor a whole year together. I talked to her once for two days at a time\\r\\nabout the Prussian House of Lords (for one must talk of something)--she\\r\\njust sighed and perspired! And you mustn’t talk of love--she’s bashful\\r\\nto hysterics--but just let her see you can’t tear yourself away--that’s\\r\\nenough. It’s fearfully comfortable; you’re quite at home, you can\\r\\nread, sit, lie about, write. You may even venture on a kiss, if you’re\\r\\ncareful.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what do I want with her?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ach, I can’t make you understand! You see, you are made for each other!\\r\\nI have often been reminded of you!... You’ll come to it in the end! So\\r\\ndoes it matter whether it’s sooner or later? There’s the feather-bed\\r\\nelement here, brother--ach! and not only that! There’s an attraction\\r\\nhere--here you have the end of the world, an anchorage, a quiet haven,\\r\\nthe navel of the earth, the three fishes that are the foundation of the\\r\\nworld, the essence of pancakes, of savoury fish-pies, of the evening\\r\\nsamovar, of soft sighs and warm shawls, and hot stoves to sleep on--as\\r\\nsnug as though you were dead, and yet you’re alive--the advantages\\r\\nof both at once! Well, hang it, brother, what stuff I’m talking, it’s\\r\\nbedtime! Listen. I sometimes wake up at night; so I’ll go in and look at\\r\\nhim. But there’s no need, it’s all right. Don’t you worry yourself,\\r\\nyet if you like, you might just look in once, too. But if you notice\\r\\nanything--delirium or fever--wake me at once. But there can’t be....”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\nRazumihin waked up next morning at eight o’clock, troubled and serious.\\r\\nHe found himself confronted with many new and unlooked-for perplexities.\\r\\nHe had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that. He\\r\\nremembered every detail of the previous day and he knew that a perfectly\\r\\nnovel experience had befallen him, that he had received an impression\\r\\nunlike anything he had known before. At the same time he recognised\\r\\nclearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly\\r\\nunattainable--so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it, and\\r\\nhe hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficulties\\r\\nbequeathed him by that “thrice accursed yesterday.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most awful recollection of the previous day was the way he had shown\\r\\nhimself “base and mean,” not only because he had been drunk, but\\r\\nbecause he had taken advantage of the young girl’s position to abuse\\r\\nher _fiancé_ in his stupid jealousy, knowing nothing of their mutual\\r\\nrelations and obligations and next to nothing of the man himself. And\\r\\nwhat right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner?\\r\\nWho had asked for his opinion? Was it thinkable that such a creature as\\r\\nAvdotya Romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money? So there\\r\\nmust be something in him. The lodgings? But after all how could he know\\r\\nthe character of the lodgings? He was furnishing a flat... Foo! how\\r\\ndespicable it all was! And what justification was it that he was drunk?\\r\\nSuch a stupid excuse was even more degrading! In wine is truth, and the\\r\\ntruth had all come out, “that is, all the uncleanness of his coarse\\r\\nand envious heart”! And would such a dream ever be permissible to\\r\\nhim, Razumihin? What was he beside such a girl--he, the drunken noisy\\r\\nbraggart of last night? Was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical\\r\\na juxtaposition? Razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and\\r\\nsuddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had\\r\\nsaid last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of\\r\\nAvdotya Romanovna... that was simply intolerable. He brought his fist\\r\\ndown heavily on the kitchen stove, hurt his hand and sent one of the\\r\\nbricks flying.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course,” he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of\\r\\nself-abasement, “of course, all these infamies can never be wiped out or\\r\\nsmoothed over... and so it’s useless even to think of it, and I must\\r\\ngo to them in silence and do my duty... in silence, too... and not ask\\r\\nforgiveness, and say nothing... for all is lost now!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet as he dressed he examined his attire more carefully than usual.\\r\\nHe hadn’t another suit--if he had had, perhaps he wouldn’t have put it\\r\\non. “I would have made a point of not putting it on.” But in any case he\\r\\ncould not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven; he had no right to offend\\r\\nthe feelings of others, especially when they were in need of his\\r\\nassistance and asking him to see them. He brushed his clothes carefully.\\r\\nHis linen was always decent; in that respect he was especially clean.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe washed that morning scrupulously--he got some soap from Nastasya--he\\r\\nwashed his hair, his neck and especially his hands. When it came to the\\r\\nquestion whether to shave his stubbly chin or not (Praskovya Pavlovna\\r\\nhad capital razors that had been left by her late husband), the question\\r\\nwas angrily answered in the negative. “Let it stay as it is! What if\\r\\nthey think that I shaved on purpose to...? They certainly would think\\r\\nso! Not on any account!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And... the worst of it was he was so coarse, so dirty, he had the\\r\\nmanners of a pothouse; and... and even admitting that he knew he had\\r\\nsome of the essentials of a gentleman... what was there in that to be\\r\\nproud of? Everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that... and all\\r\\nthe same (he remembered) he, too, had done little things... not exactly\\r\\ndishonest, and yet.... And what thoughts he sometimes had; hm... and to\\r\\nset all that beside Avdotya Romanovna! Confound it! So be it! Well, he’d\\r\\nmake a point then of being dirty, greasy, pothouse in his manners and he\\r\\nwouldn’t care! He’d be worse!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was engaged in such monologues when Zossimov, who had spent the night\\r\\nin Praskovya Pavlovna’s parlour, came in.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first.\\r\\nRazumihin informed him that Raskolnikov was sleeping like a dormouse.\\r\\nZossimov gave orders that they shouldn’t wake him and promised to see\\r\\nhim again about eleven.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If he is still at home,” he added. “Damn it all! If one can’t control\\r\\none’s patients, how is one to cure them? Do you know whether _he_ will\\r\\ngo to them, or whether _they_ are coming here?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are coming, I think,” said Razumihin, understanding the object\\r\\nof the question, “and they will discuss their family affairs, no doubt.\\r\\nI’ll be off. You, as the doctor, have more right to be here than I.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I am not a father confessor; I shall come and go away; I’ve plenty\\r\\nto do besides looking after them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“One thing worries me,” interposed Razumihin, frowning. “On the way home\\r\\nI talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him... all sorts of things... and\\r\\namongst them that you were afraid that he... might become insane.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You told the ladies so, too.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know it was stupid! You may beat me if you like! Did you think so\\r\\nseriously?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s nonsense, I tell you, how could I think it seriously? You,\\r\\nyourself, described him as a monomaniac when you fetched me to\\r\\nhim... and we added fuel to the fire yesterday, you did, that is, with\\r\\nyour story about the painter; it was a nice conversation, when he was,\\r\\nperhaps, mad on that very point! If only I’d known what happened then\\r\\nat the police station and that some wretch... had insulted him with this\\r\\nsuspicion! Hm... I would not have allowed that conversation yesterday.\\r\\nThese monomaniacs will make a mountain out of a mole-hill... and\\r\\nsee their fancies as solid realities.... As far as I remember, it was\\r\\nZametov’s story that cleared up half the mystery, to my mind. Why, I\\r\\nknow one case in which a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut the throat\\r\\nof a little boy of eight, because he couldn’t endure the jokes he made\\r\\nevery day at table! And in this case his rags, the insolent police\\r\\nofficer, the fever and this suspicion! All that working upon a man half\\r\\nfrantic with hypochondria, and with his morbid exceptional vanity! That\\r\\nmay well have been the starting-point of illness. Well, bother it\\r\\nall!... And, by the way, that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow, but\\r\\nhm... he shouldn’t have told all that last night. He is an awful\\r\\nchatterbox!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But whom did he tell it to? You and me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And Porfiry.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What does that matter?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And, by the way, have you any influence on them, his mother and sister?\\r\\nTell them to be more careful with him to-day....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They’ll get on all right!” Razumihin answered reluctantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why is he so set against this Luzhin? A man with money and she doesn’t\\r\\nseem to dislike him... and they haven’t a farthing, I suppose? eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what business is it of yours?” Razumihin cried with annoyance. “How\\r\\ncan I tell whether they’ve a farthing? Ask them yourself and perhaps\\r\\nyou’ll find out....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Foo! what an ass you are sometimes! Last night’s wine has not gone off\\r\\nyet.... Good-bye; thank your Praskovya Pavlovna from me for my night’s\\r\\nlodging. She locked herself in, made no reply to my _bonjour_ through\\r\\nthe door; she was up at seven o’clock, the samovar was taken into her\\r\\nfrom the kitchen. I was not vouchsafed a personal interview....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt nine o’clock precisely Razumihin reached the lodgings at Bakaleyev’s\\r\\nhouse. Both ladies were waiting for him with nervous impatience. They\\r\\nhad risen at seven o’clock or earlier. He entered looking as black as\\r\\nnight, bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it. He\\r\\nhad reckoned without his host: Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly rushed at\\r\\nhim, seized him by both hands and was almost kissing them. He glanced\\r\\ntimidly at Avdotya Romanovna, but her proud countenance wore at that\\r\\nmoment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness, such\\r\\ncomplete and unlooked-for respect (in place of the sneering looks and\\r\\nill-disguised contempt he had expected), that it threw him into greater\\r\\nconfusion than if he had been met with abuse. Fortunately there was a\\r\\nsubject for conversation, and he made haste to snatch at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHearing that everything was going well and that Rodya had not yet waked,\\r\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna declared that she was glad to hear it, because\\r\\n“she had something which it was very, very necessary to talk over\\r\\nbeforehand.” Then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation\\r\\nto have it with them; they had waited to have it with him. Avdotya\\r\\nRomanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter, and\\r\\nthey asked him to bring tea which was served at last, but in such\\r\\na dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed. Razumihin\\r\\nvigorously attacked the lodgings, but, remembering Luzhin, stopped\\r\\nin embarrassment and was greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s\\r\\nquestions, which showered in a continual stream upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly interrupted\\r\\nby their questions, and succeeded in describing to them all the\\r\\nmost important facts he knew of the last year of Raskolnikov’s life,\\r\\nconcluding with a circumstantial account of his illness. He omitted,\\r\\nhowever, many things, which were better omitted, including the scene at\\r\\nthe police station with all its consequences. They listened eagerly\\r\\nto his story, and, when he thought he had finished and satisfied his\\r\\nlisteners, he found that they considered he had hardly begun.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell me, tell me! What do you think...? Excuse me, I still don’t know\\r\\nyour name!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna put in hastily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dmitri Prokofitch.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should like very, very much to know, Dmitri Prokofitch... how he\\r\\nlooks... on things in general now, that is, how can I explain, what are\\r\\nhis likes and dislikes? Is he always so irritable? Tell me, if you can,\\r\\nwhat are his hopes and, so to say, his dreams? Under what influences is\\r\\nhe now? In a word, I should like...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, mother, how can he answer all that at once?” observed Dounia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens, I had not expected to find him in the least like this,\\r\\nDmitri Prokofitch!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Naturally,” answered Razumihin. “I have no mother, but my uncle comes\\r\\nevery year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me, even in\\r\\nappearance, though he is a clever man; and your three years’ separation\\r\\nmeans a great deal. What am I to tell you? I have known Rodion for\\r\\na year and a half; he is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and of\\r\\nlate--and perhaps for a long time before--he has been suspicious and\\r\\nfanciful. He has a noble nature and a kind heart. He does not like\\r\\nshowing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his\\r\\nheart freely. Sometimes, though, he is not at all morbid, but simply\\r\\ncold and inhumanly callous; it’s as though he were alternating between\\r\\ntwo characters. Sometimes he is fearfully reserved! He says he is\\r\\nso busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he lies in bed doing\\r\\nnothing. He doesn’t jeer at things, not because he hasn’t the wit, but\\r\\nas though he hadn’t time to waste on such trifles. He never listens\\r\\nto what is said to him. He is never interested in what interests other\\r\\npeople at any given moment. He thinks very highly of himself and perhaps\\r\\nhe is right. Well, what more? I think your arrival will have a most\\r\\nbeneficial influence upon him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“God grant it may,” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, distressed by\\r\\nRazumihin’s account of her Rodya.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Avdotya Romanovna at last.\\r\\nHe glanced at her often while he was talking, but only for a moment and\\r\\nlooked away again at once. Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listening\\r\\nattentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with her\\r\\narms folded and her lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question,\\r\\nwithout stopping her walk. She had the same habit of not listening to\\r\\nwhat was said. She was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a\\r\\nwhite transparent scarf round her neck. Razumihin soon detected signs of\\r\\nextreme poverty in their belongings. Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressed\\r\\nlike a queen, he felt that he would not be afraid of her, but perhaps\\r\\njust because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery\\r\\nof her surroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began to be\\r\\nafraid of every word he uttered, every gesture he made, which was very\\r\\ntrying for a man who already felt diffident.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ve told us a great deal that is interesting about my brother’s\\r\\ncharacter... and have told it impartially. I am glad. I thought that you\\r\\nwere too uncritically devoted to him,” observed Avdotya Romanovna with\\r\\na smile. “I think you are right that he needs a woman’s care,” she added\\r\\nthoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I didn’t say so; but I daresay you are right, only...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He loves no one and perhaps he never will,” Razumihin declared\\r\\ndecisively.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You mean he is not capable of love?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, you are awfully like your brother, in\\r\\neverything, indeed!” he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise, but\\r\\nremembering at once what he had just before said of her brother,\\r\\nhe turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion. Avdotya\\r\\nRomanovna couldn’t help laughing when she looked at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You may both be mistaken about Rodya,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna remarked,\\r\\nslightly piqued. “I am not talking of our present difficulty, Dounia.\\r\\nWhat Pyotr Petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and I have\\r\\nsupposed may be mistaken, but you can’t imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, how\\r\\nmoody and, so to say, capricious he is. I never could depend on what\\r\\nhe would do when he was only fifteen. And I am sure that he might\\r\\ndo something now that nobody else would think of doing... Well, for\\r\\ninstance, do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave\\r\\nme a shock that nearly killed me, when he had the idea of marrying that\\r\\ngirl--what was her name--his landlady’s daughter?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you hear about that affair?” asked Avdotya Romanovna.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you suppose----” Pulcheria Alexandrovna continued warmly. “Do you\\r\\nsuppose that my tears, my entreaties, my illness, my possible death from\\r\\ngrief, our poverty would have made him pause? No, he would calmly have\\r\\ndisregarded all obstacles. And yet it isn’t that he doesn’t love us!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has never spoken a word of that affair to me,” Razumihin answered\\r\\ncautiously. “But I did hear something from Praskovya Pavlovna herself,\\r\\nthough she is by no means a gossip. And what I heard certainly was\\r\\nrather strange.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what did you hear?” both the ladies asked at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, nothing very special. I only learned that the marriage, which\\r\\nonly failed to take place through the girl’s death, was not at all to\\r\\nPraskovya Pavlovna’s liking. They say, too, the girl was not at all\\r\\npretty, in fact I am told positively ugly... and such an invalid... and\\r\\nqueer. But she seems to have had some good qualities. She must have\\r\\nhad some good qualities or it’s quite inexplicable.... She had no money\\r\\neither and he wouldn’t have considered her money.... But it’s always\\r\\ndifficult to judge in such matters.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sure she was a good girl,” Avdotya Romanovna observed briefly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“God forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her death. Though I don’t know\\r\\nwhich of them would have caused most misery to the other--he to her\\r\\nor she to him,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna concluded. Then she began\\r\\ntentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous day with\\r\\nLuzhin, hesitating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously to\\r\\nthe latter’s annoyance. This incident more than all the rest evidently\\r\\ncaused her uneasiness, even consternation. Razumihin described it in\\r\\ndetail again, but this time he added his own conclusions: he openly\\r\\nblamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, not\\r\\nseeking to excuse him on the score of his illness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He had planned it before his illness,” he added.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think so, too,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air.\\r\\nBut she was very much surprised at hearing Razumihin express himself\\r\\nso carefully and even with a certain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch.\\r\\nAvdotya Romanovna, too, was struck by it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\\r\\ncould not resist asking.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can have no other opinion of your daughter’s future husband,”\\r\\n Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth, “and I don’t say it simply\\r\\nfrom vulgar politeness, but because... simply because Avdotya Romanovna\\r\\nhas of her own free will deigned to accept this man. If I spoke so\\r\\nrudely of him last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and...\\r\\nmad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely... and this\\r\\nmorning I am ashamed of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe crimsoned and ceased speaking. Avdotya Romanovna flushed, but did not\\r\\nbreak the silence. She had not uttered a word from the moment they began\\r\\nto speak of Luzhin.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously did not know what\\r\\nto do. At last, faltering and continually glancing at her daughter, she\\r\\nconfessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You see, Dmitri Prokofitch,” she began. “I’ll be perfectly open with\\r\\nDmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course, mother,” said Avdotya Romanovna emphatically.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is what it is,” she began in haste, as though the permission to\\r\\nspeak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind. “Very early this\\r\\nmorning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in reply to our letter\\r\\nannouncing our arrival. He promised to meet us at the station, you\\r\\nknow; instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these\\r\\nlodgings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he would\\r\\nbe here himself this morning. But this morning this note came from him.\\r\\nYou’d better read it yourself; there is one point in it which worries me\\r\\nvery much... you will soon see what that is, and... tell me your candid\\r\\nopinion, Dmitri Prokofitch! You know Rodya’s character better than\\r\\nanyone and no one can advise us better than you can. Dounia, I must tell\\r\\nyou, made her decision at once, but I still don’t feel sure how to act\\r\\nand I... I’ve been waiting for your opinion.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRazumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read\\r\\nas follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dear Madam, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the honour to inform you\\r\\nthat owing to unforeseen obstacles I was rendered unable to meet you at\\r\\nthe railway station; I sent a very competent person with the same object\\r\\nin view. I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with\\r\\nyou to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does not admit of\\r\\ndelay, and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while you\\r\\nare meeting your son, and Avdotya Romanovna her brother. I shall have\\r\\nthe honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings\\r\\nnot later than to-morrow evening at eight o’clock precisely, and\\r\\nherewith I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, imperative\\r\\nrequest that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview--as\\r\\nhe offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my\\r\\nvisit to him in his illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desire\\r\\nfrom you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation\\r\\nupon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn your own\\r\\ninterpretation. I have the honour to inform you, in anticipation,\\r\\nthat if, in spite of my request, I meet Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be\\r\\ncompelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to\\r\\nblame. I write on the assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared so\\r\\nill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, being able\\r\\nto leave the house, may visit you also. I was confirmed in that belief\\r\\nby the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who\\r\\nwas run over and has since died, to whose daughter, a young woman of\\r\\nnotorious behaviour, he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext of the\\r\\nfuneral, which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to\\r\\nraise that sum. Herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable\\r\\ndaughter, Avdotya Romanovna, I beg you to accept the respectful homage\\r\\nof\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your humble servant,\\r\\n\\r\\n“P. LUZHIN.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“What am I to do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?” began Pulcheria Alexandrovna,\\r\\nalmost weeping. “How can I ask Rodya not to come? Yesterday he insisted\\r\\nso earnestly on our refusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered not\\r\\nto receive Rodya! He will come on purpose if he knows, and... what will\\r\\nhappen then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Act on Avdotya Romanovna’s decision,” Razumihin answered calmly at\\r\\nonce.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, dear me! She says... goodness knows what she says, she doesn’t\\r\\nexplain her object! She says that it would be best, at least, not that\\r\\nit would be best, but that it’s absolutely necessary that Rodya should\\r\\nmake a point of being here at eight o’clock and that they must meet....\\r\\nI didn’t want even to show him the letter, but to prevent him\\r\\nfrom coming by some stratagem with your help... because he is so\\r\\nirritable.... Besides I don’t understand about that drunkard who died\\r\\nand that daughter, and how he could have given the daughter all the\\r\\nmoney... which...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Which cost you such sacrifice, mother,” put in Avdotya Romanovna.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He was not himself yesterday,” Razumihin said thoughtfully, “if you\\r\\nonly knew what he was up to in a restaurant yesterday, though there\\r\\nwas sense in it too.... Hm! He did say something, as we were going home\\r\\nyesterday evening, about a dead man and a girl, but I didn’t understand\\r\\na word.... But last night, I myself...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The best thing, mother, will be for us to go to him ourselves and\\r\\nthere I assure you we shall see at once what’s to be done. Besides,\\r\\nit’s getting late--good heavens, it’s past ten,” she cried looking at\\r\\na splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thin\\r\\nVenetian chain, and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her\\r\\ndress. “A present from her _fiancé_,” thought Razumihin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We must start, Dounia, we must start,” her mother cried in a flutter.\\r\\n“He will be thinking we are still angry after yesterday, from our coming\\r\\nso late. Merciful heavens!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle;\\r\\nDounia, too, put on her things. Her gloves, as Razumihin noticed, were\\r\\nnot merely shabby but had holes in them, and yet this evident poverty\\r\\ngave the two ladies an air of special dignity, which is always found in\\r\\npeople who know how to wear poor clothes. Razumihin looked reverently\\r\\nat Dounia and felt proud of escorting her. “The queen who mended her\\r\\nstockings in prison,” he thought, “must have looked then every inch a\\r\\nqueen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquets and levées.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My God!” exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna, “little did I think that I\\r\\nshould ever fear seeing my son, my darling, darling Rodya! I am afraid,\\r\\nDmitri Prokofitch,” she added, glancing at him timidly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t be afraid, mother,” said Dounia, kissing her, “better have faith\\r\\nin him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, dear, I have faith in him, but I haven’t slept all night,”\\r\\n exclaimed the poor woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came out into the street.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know, Dounia, when I dozed a little this morning I dreamed of\\r\\nMarfa Petrovna... she was all in white... she came up to me, took\\r\\nmy hand, and shook her head at me, but so sternly as though she were\\r\\nblaming me.... Is that a good omen? Oh, dear me! You don’t know, Dmitri\\r\\nProkofitch, that Marfa Petrovna’s dead!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I didn’t know; who is Marfa Petrovna?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She died suddenly; and only fancy...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Afterwards, mamma,” put in Dounia. “He doesn’t know who Marfa Petrovna\\r\\nis.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, you don’t know? And I was thinking that you knew all about us.\\r\\nForgive me, Dmitri Prokofitch, I don’t know what I am thinking about\\r\\nthese last few days. I look upon you really as a providence for us, and\\r\\nso I took it for granted that you knew all about us. I look on you as a\\r\\nrelation.... Don’t be angry with me for saying so. Dear me, what’s the\\r\\nmatter with your right hand? Have you knocked it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I bruised it,” muttered Razumihin overjoyed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I sometimes speak too much from the heart, so that Dounia finds fault\\r\\nwith me.... But, dear me, what a cupboard he lives in! I wonder whether\\r\\nhe is awake? Does this woman, his landlady, consider it a room? Listen,\\r\\nyou say he does not like to show his feelings, so perhaps I shall annoy\\r\\nhim with my... weaknesses? Do advise me, Dmitri Prokofitch, how am I to\\r\\ntreat him? I feel quite distracted, you know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t question him too much about anything if you see him frown; don’t\\r\\nask him too much about his health; he doesn’t like that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, Dmitri Prokofitch, how hard it is to be a mother! But here are the\\r\\nstairs.... What an awful staircase!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mother, you are quite pale, don’t distress yourself, darling,” said\\r\\nDounia caressing her, then with flashing eyes she added: “He ought to be\\r\\nhappy at seeing you, and you are tormenting yourself so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait, I’ll peep in and see whether he has waked up.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies slowly followed Razumihin, who went on before, and when they\\r\\nreached the landlady’s door on the fourth storey, they noticed that her\\r\\ndoor was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching\\r\\nthem from the darkness within. When their eyes met, the door was\\r\\nsuddenly shut with such a slam that Pulcheria Alexandrovna almost cried\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is well, quite well!” Zossimov cried cheerfully as they entered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place\\r\\nas before, on the sofa. Raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner,\\r\\nfully dressed and carefully washed and combed, as he had not been for\\r\\nsome time past. The room was immediately crowded, yet Nastasya managed\\r\\nto follow the visitors in and stayed to listen.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with his condition the\\r\\nday before, but he was still pale, listless, and sombre. He looked like\\r\\na wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering.\\r\\nHis brows were knitted, his lips compressed, his eyes feverish. He spoke\\r\\nlittle and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there was a\\r\\nrestlessness in his movements.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete\\r\\nthe impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm. The\\r\\npale, sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister\\r\\nentered, but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering, in\\r\\nplace of its listless dejection. The light soon died away, but the look\\r\\nof suffering remained, and Zossimov, watching and studying his patient\\r\\nwith all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise, noticed\\r\\nin him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister, but a sort of\\r\\nbitter, hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable\\r\\ntorture. He saw later that almost every word of the following\\r\\nconversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it. But\\r\\nat the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself\\r\\nand hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day had, like a\\r\\nmonomaniac, fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I see myself now that I am almost well,” said Raskolnikov,\\r\\ngiving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna radiant at once. “And I don’t say this _as I did\\r\\nyesterday_,” he said, addressing Razumihin, with a friendly pressure of\\r\\nhis hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, indeed, I am quite surprised at him to-day,” began Zossimov, much\\r\\ndelighted at the ladies’ entrance, for he had not succeeded in keeping\\r\\nup a conversation with his patient for ten minutes. “In another three or\\r\\nfour days, if he goes on like this, he will be just as before, that is,\\r\\nas he was a month ago, or two... or perhaps even three. This has been\\r\\ncoming on for a long while.... eh? Confess, now, that it has been\\r\\nperhaps your own fault?” he added, with a tentative smile, as though\\r\\nstill afraid of irritating him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is very possible,” answered Raskolnikov coldly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should say, too,” continued Zossimov with zest, “that your complete\\r\\nrecovery depends solely on yourself. Now that one can talk to you,\\r\\nI should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the\\r\\nelementary, so to speak, fundamental causes tending to produce your\\r\\nmorbid condition: in that case you will be cured, if not, it will go\\r\\nfrom bad to worse. These fundamental causes I don’t know, but they must\\r\\nbe known to you. You are an intelligent man, and must have observed\\r\\nyourself, of course. I fancy the first stage of your derangement\\r\\ncoincides with your leaving the university. You must not be left without\\r\\noccupation, and so, work and a definite aim set before you might, I\\r\\nfancy, be very beneficial.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes; you are perfectly right.... I will make haste and return to\\r\\nthe university: and then everything will go smoothly....”\\r\\n\\r\\nZossimov, who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before\\r\\nthe ladies, was certainly somewhat mystified, when, glancing at his\\r\\npatient, he observed unmistakable mockery on his face. This lasted\\r\\nan instant, however. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thanking\\r\\nZossimov, especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What! he saw you last night?” Raskolnikov asked, as though startled.\\r\\n“Then you have not slept either after your journey.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ach, Rodya, that was only till two o’clock. Dounia and I never go to\\r\\nbed before two at home.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know how to thank him either,” Raskolnikov went on,\\r\\nsuddenly frowning and looking down. “Setting aside the question of\\r\\npayment--forgive me for referring to it (he turned to Zossimov)--I\\r\\nreally don’t know what I have done to deserve such special attention\\r\\nfrom you! I simply don’t understand it... and... and... it weighs upon\\r\\nme, indeed, because I don’t understand it. I tell you so candidly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t be irritated.” Zossimov forced himself to laugh. “Assume that you\\r\\nare my first patient--well--we fellows just beginning to practise love\\r\\nour first patients as if they were our children, and some almost fall in\\r\\nlove with them. And, of course, I am not rich in patients.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say nothing about him,” added Raskolnikov, pointing to Razumihin,\\r\\n“though he has had nothing from me either but insult and trouble.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What nonsense he is talking! Why, you are in a sentimental mood to-day,\\r\\nare you?” shouted Razumihin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he had had more penetration he would have seen that there was no\\r\\ntrace of sentimentality in him, but something indeed quite the opposite.\\r\\nBut Avdotya Romanovna noticed it. She was intently and uneasily watching\\r\\nher brother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“As for you, mother, I don’t dare to speak,” he went on, as though\\r\\nrepeating a lesson learned by heart. “It is only to-day that I have\\r\\nbeen able to realise a little how distressed you must have been here\\r\\nyesterday, waiting for me to come back.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had said this, he suddenly held out his hand to his sister,\\r\\nsmiling without a word. But in this smile there was a flash of real\\r\\nunfeigned feeling. Dounia caught it at once, and warmly pressed his\\r\\nhand, overjoyed and thankful. It was the first time he had addressed her\\r\\nsince their dispute the previous day. The mother’s face lighted up\\r\\nwith ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken\\r\\nreconciliation. “Yes, that is what I love him for,” Razumihin,\\r\\nexaggerating it all, muttered to himself, with a vigorous turn in his\\r\\nchair. “He has these movements.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how well he does it all,” the mother was thinking to herself. “What\\r\\ngenerous impulses he has, and how simply, how delicately he put an end\\r\\nto all the misunderstanding with his sister--simply by holding out his\\r\\nhand at the right minute and looking at her like that.... And what\\r\\nfine eyes he has, and how fine his whole face is!... He is even better\\r\\nlooking than Dounia.... But, good heavens, what a suit--how terribly\\r\\nhe’s dressed!... Vasya, the messenger boy in Afanasy Ivanitch’s shop, is\\r\\nbetter dressed! I could rush at him and hug him... weep over him--but\\r\\nI am afraid.... Oh, dear, he’s so strange! He’s talking kindly, but I’m\\r\\nafraid! Why, what am I afraid of?...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Rodya, you wouldn’t believe,” she began suddenly, in haste to\\r\\nanswer his words to her, “how unhappy Dounia and I were yesterday! Now\\r\\nthat it’s all over and done with and we are quite happy again--I can\\r\\ntell you. Fancy, we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace\\r\\nyou and that woman--ah, here she is! Good morning, Nastasya!... She told\\r\\nus at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away\\r\\nfrom the doctor in delirium, and they were looking for you in the\\r\\nstreets. You can’t imagine how we felt! I couldn’t help thinking of the\\r\\ntragic end of Lieutenant Potanchikov, a friend of your father’s--you\\r\\ncan’t remember him, Rodya--who ran out in the same way in a high fever\\r\\nand fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldn’t pull him out\\r\\ntill next day. Of course, we exaggerated things. We were on the point of\\r\\nrushing to find Pyotr Petrovitch to ask him to help.... Because we were\\r\\nalone, utterly alone,” she said plaintively and stopped short,\\r\\nsuddenly, recollecting it was still somewhat dangerous to speak of Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch, although “we are quite happy again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes.... Of course it’s very annoying....” Raskolnikov muttered in\\r\\nreply, but with such a preoccupied and inattentive air that Dounia gazed\\r\\nat him in perplexity.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What else was it I wanted to say?” He went on trying to recollect. “Oh,\\r\\nyes; mother, and you too, Dounia, please don’t think that I didn’t mean\\r\\nto come and see you to-day and was waiting for you to come first.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you saying, Rodya?” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. She, too,\\r\\nwas surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is he answering us as a duty?” Dounia wondered. “Is he being reconciled\\r\\nand asking forgiveness as though he were performing a rite or repeating\\r\\na lesson?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve only just waked up, and wanted to go to you, but was delayed owing\\r\\nto my clothes; I forgot yesterday to ask her... Nastasya... to wash out\\r\\nthe blood... I’ve only just dressed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Blood! What blood?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, nothing--don’t be uneasy. It was when I was wandering about\\r\\nyesterday, rather delirious, I chanced upon a man who had been run\\r\\nover... a clerk...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Delirious? But you remember everything!” Razumihin interrupted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s true,” Raskolnikov answered with special carefulness. “I\\r\\nremember everything even to the slightest detail, and yet--why I did\\r\\nthat and went there and said that, I can’t clearly explain now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A familiar phenomenon,” interposed Zossimov, “actions are sometimes\\r\\nperformed in a masterly and most cunning way, while the direction of the\\r\\nactions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions--it’s\\r\\nlike a dream.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps it’s a good thing really that he should think me almost a\\r\\nmadman,” thought Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, people in perfect health act in the same way too,” observed\\r\\nDounia, looking uneasily at Zossimov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is some truth in your observation,” the latter replied. “In that\\r\\nsense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen, but with the\\r\\nslight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder, for we\\r\\nmust draw a line. A normal man, it is true, hardly exists. Among\\r\\ndozens--perhaps hundreds of thousands--hardly one is to be met with.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the word “madman,” carelessly dropped by Zossimov in his chatter on\\r\\nhis favourite subject, everyone frowned.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention, plunged in thought with a\\r\\nstrange smile on his pale lips. He was still meditating on something.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, what about the man who was run over? I interrupted you!”\\r\\n Razumihin cried hastily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What?” Raskolnikov seemed to wake up. “Oh... I got spattered with\\r\\nblood helping to carry him to his lodging. By the way, mamma, I did an\\r\\nunpardonable thing yesterday. I was literally out of my mind. I gave\\r\\naway all the money you sent me... to his wife for the funeral. She’s\\r\\na widow now, in consumption, a poor creature... three little children,\\r\\nstarving... nothing in the house... there’s a daughter, too... perhaps\\r\\nyou’d have given it yourself if you’d seen them. But I had no right to\\r\\ndo it I admit, especially as I knew how you needed the money yourself.\\r\\nTo help others one must have the right to do it, or else _Crevez,\\r\\nchiens, si vous n’êtes pas contents_.” He laughed, “That’s right, isn’t\\r\\nit, Dounia?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, it’s not,” answered Dounia firmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Bah! you, too, have ideals,” he muttered, looking at her almost with\\r\\nhatred, and smiling sarcastically. “I ought to have considered that....\\r\\nWell, that’s praiseworthy, and it’s better for you... and if you reach a\\r\\nline you won’t overstep, you will be unhappy... and if you overstep it,\\r\\nmaybe you will be still unhappier.... But all that’s nonsense,” he added\\r\\nirritably, vexed at being carried away. “I only meant to say that I beg\\r\\nyour forgiveness, mother,” he concluded, shortly and abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s enough, Rodya, I am sure that everything you do is very good,”\\r\\n said his mother, delighted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t be too sure,” he answered, twisting his mouth into a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nA silence followed. There was a certain constraint in all this\\r\\nconversation, and in the silence, and in the reconciliation, and in the\\r\\nforgiveness, and all were feeling it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is as though they were afraid of me,” Raskolnikov was thinking\\r\\nto himself, looking askance at his mother and sister. Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna was indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yet in their absence I seemed to love them so much,” flashed through\\r\\nhis mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know, Rodya, Marfa Petrovna is dead,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\\r\\nsuddenly blurted out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What Marfa Petrovna?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, mercy on us--Marfa Petrovna Svidrigaïlov. I wrote you so much about\\r\\nher.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A-a-h! Yes, I remember.... So she’s dead! Oh, really?” he roused\\r\\nhimself suddenly, as if waking up. “What did she die of?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only imagine, quite suddenly,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna answered\\r\\nhurriedly, encouraged by his curiosity. “On the very day I was sending\\r\\nyou that letter! Would you believe it, that awful man seems to have been\\r\\nthe cause of her death. They say he beat her dreadfully.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, were they on such bad terms?” he asked, addressing his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at all. Quite the contrary indeed. With her, he was always very\\r\\npatient, considerate even. In fact, all those seven years of their\\r\\nmarried life he gave way to her, too much so indeed, in many cases. All\\r\\nof a sudden he seems to have lost patience.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven\\r\\nyears? You seem to be defending him, Dounia?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no, he’s an awful man! I can imagine nothing more awful!” Dounia\\r\\nanswered, almost with a shudder, knitting her brows, and sinking into\\r\\nthought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That had happened in the morning,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on\\r\\nhurriedly. “And directly afterwards she ordered the horses to be\\r\\nharnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner. She always used\\r\\nto drive to the town in such cases. She ate a very good dinner, I am\\r\\ntold....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“After the beating?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was always her... habit; and immediately after dinner, so as not\\r\\nto be late in starting, she went to the bath-house.... You see, she was\\r\\nundergoing some treatment with baths. They have a cold spring there, and\\r\\nshe used to bathe in it regularly every day, and no sooner had she got\\r\\ninto the water when she suddenly had a stroke!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should think so,” said Zossimov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And did he beat her badly?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What does that matter!” put in Dounia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“H’m! But I don’t know why you want to tell us such gossip, mother,”\\r\\n said Raskolnikov irritably, as it were in spite of himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, my dear, I don’t know what to talk about,” broke from Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, are you all afraid of me?” he asked, with a constrained smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s certainly true,” said Dounia, looking directly and sternly at\\r\\nher brother. “Mother was crossing herself with terror as she came up the\\r\\nstairs.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis face worked, as though in convulsion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ach, what are you saying, Dounia! Don’t be angry, please, Rodya....\\r\\nWhy did you say that, Dounia?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began,\\r\\noverwhelmed--“You see, coming here, I was dreaming all the way, in the\\r\\ntrain, how we should meet, how we should talk over everything\\r\\ntogether.... And I was so happy, I did not notice the journey! But what\\r\\nam I saying? I am happy now.... You should not, Dounia.... I am happy\\r\\nnow--simply in seeing you, Rodya....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hush, mother,” he muttered in confusion, not looking at her, but\\r\\npressing her hand. “We shall have time to speak freely of everything!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he said this, he was suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turned\\r\\npale. Again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadly\\r\\nchill over his soul. Again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to\\r\\nhim that he had just told a fearful lie--that he would never now be\\r\\nable to speak freely of everything--that he would never again be able to\\r\\n_speak_ of anything to anyone. The anguish of this thought was such that\\r\\nfor a moment he almost forgot himself. He got up from his seat, and not\\r\\nlooking at anyone walked towards the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you about?” cried Razumihin, clutching him by the arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat down again, and began looking about him, in silence. They were\\r\\nall looking at him in perplexity.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what are you all so dull for?” he shouted, suddenly and quite\\r\\nunexpectedly. “Do say something! What’s the use of sitting like this?\\r\\nCome, do speak. Let us talk.... We meet together and sit in silence....\\r\\nCome, anything!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank God; I was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning\\r\\nagain,” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is the matter, Rodya?” asked Avdotya Romanovna, distrustfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, nothing! I remembered something,” he answered, and suddenly\\r\\nlaughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, if you remembered something; that’s all right!... I was beginning\\r\\nto think...” muttered Zossimov, getting up from the sofa. “It is time\\r\\nfor me to be off. I will look in again perhaps... if I can...” He made\\r\\nhis bows, and went out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What an excellent man!” observed Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, excellent, splendid, well-educated, intelligent,” Raskolnikov\\r\\nbegan, suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity, and a liveliness he\\r\\nhad not shown till then. “I can’t remember where I met him before my\\r\\nillness.... I believe I have met him somewhere----... And this is a good\\r\\nman, too,” he nodded at Razumihin. “Do you like him, Dounia?” he asked\\r\\nher; and suddenly, for some unknown reason, laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very much,” answered Dounia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Foo!--what a pig you are!” Razumihin protested, blushing in terrible\\r\\nconfusion, and he got up from his chair. Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled\\r\\nfaintly, but Raskolnikov laughed aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where are you off to?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must go.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You need not at all. Stay. Zossimov has gone, so you must. Don’t go.\\r\\nWhat’s the time? Is it twelve o’clock? What a pretty watch you have got,\\r\\nDounia. But why are you all silent again? I do all the talking.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was a present from Marfa Petrovna,” answered Dounia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And a very expensive one!” added Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A-ah! What a big one! Hardly like a lady’s.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I like that sort,” said Dounia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So it is not a present from her _fiancé_,” thought Razumihin, and was\\r\\nunreasonably delighted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought it was Luzhin’s present,” observed Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, he has not made Dounia any presents yet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A-ah! And do you remember, mother, I was in love and wanted to get\\r\\nmarried?” he said suddenly, looking at his mother, who was disconcerted\\r\\nby the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes, my dear.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dounia and Razumihin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“H’m, yes. What shall I tell you? I don’t remember much indeed. She was\\r\\nsuch a sickly girl,” he went on, growing dreamy and looking down again.\\r\\n“Quite an invalid. She was fond of giving alms to the poor, and was\\r\\nalways dreaming of a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when she\\r\\nbegan talking to me about it. Yes, yes, I remember. I remember very\\r\\nwell. She was an ugly little thing. I really don’t know what drew me\\r\\nto her then--I think it was because she was always ill. If she had been\\r\\nlame or hunchback, I believe I should have liked her better still,” he\\r\\nsmiled dreamily. “Yes, it was a sort of spring delirium.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, it was not only spring delirium,” said Dounia, with warm feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but did not hear or did\\r\\nnot understand her words. Then, completely lost in thought, he got up,\\r\\nwent up to his mother, kissed her, went back to his place and sat down.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You love her even now?” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, touched.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Her? Now? Oh, yes.... You ask about her? No... that’s all now, as\\r\\nit were, in another world... and so long ago. And indeed everything\\r\\nhappening here seems somehow far away.” He looked attentively at them.\\r\\n“You, now... I seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away...\\r\\nbut, goodness knows why we are talking of that! And what’s the use of\\r\\nasking about it?” he added with annoyance, and biting his nails, fell\\r\\ninto dreamy silence again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a wretched lodging you have, Rodya! It’s like a tomb,” said\\r\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna, suddenly breaking the oppressive silence. “I\\r\\nam sure it’s quite half through your lodging you have become so\\r\\nmelancholy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My lodging,” he answered, listlessly. “Yes, the lodging had a great\\r\\ndeal to do with it.... I thought that, too.... If only you knew, though,\\r\\nwhat a strange thing you said just now, mother,” he said, laughing\\r\\nstrangely.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little more, and their companionship, this mother and this sister,\\r\\nwith him after three years’ absence, this intimate tone of conversation,\\r\\nin face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything,\\r\\nwould have been beyond his power of endurance. But there was one urgent\\r\\nmatter which must be settled one way or the other that day--so he had\\r\\ndecided when he woke. Now he was glad to remember it, as a means of\\r\\nescape.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen, Dounia,” he began, gravely and drily, “of course I beg your\\r\\npardon for yesterday, but I consider it my duty to tell you again that\\r\\nI do not withdraw from my chief point. It is me or Luzhin. If I am a\\r\\nscoundrel, you must not be. One is enough. If you marry Luzhin, I cease\\r\\nat once to look on you as a sister.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rodya, Rodya! It is the same as yesterday again,” Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna cried, mournfully. “And why do you call yourself a\\r\\nscoundrel? I can’t bear it. You said the same yesterday.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Brother,” Dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness. “In all\\r\\nthis there is a mistake on your part. I thought it over at night,\\r\\nand found out the mistake. It is all because you seem to fancy I am\\r\\nsacrificing myself to someone and for someone. That is not the case at\\r\\nall. I am simply marrying for my own sake, because things are hard for\\r\\nme. Though, of course, I shall be glad if I succeed in being useful to\\r\\nmy family. But that is not the chief motive for my decision....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She is lying,” he thought to himself, biting his nails vindictively.\\r\\n“Proud creature! She won’t admit she wants to do it out of charity! Too\\r\\nhaughty! Oh, base characters! They even love as though they hate.... Oh,\\r\\nhow I... hate them all!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In fact,” continued Dounia, “I am marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because of\\r\\ntwo evils I choose the less. I intend to do honestly all he expects of\\r\\nme, so I am not deceiving him.... Why did you smile just now?” She, too,\\r\\nflushed, and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All?” he asked, with a malignant grin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Within certain limits. Both the manner and form of Pyotr Petrovitch’s\\r\\ncourtship showed me at once what he wanted. He may, of course, think too\\r\\nwell of himself, but I hope he esteems me, too.... Why are you laughing\\r\\nagain?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And why are you blushing again? You are lying, sister. You are\\r\\nintentionally lying, simply from feminine obstinacy, simply to hold your\\r\\nown against me.... You cannot respect Luzhin. I have seen him and talked\\r\\nwith him. So you are selling yourself for money, and so in any case you\\r\\nare acting basely, and I am glad at least that you can blush for it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is not true. I am not lying,” cried Dounia, losing her composure.\\r\\n“I would not marry him if I were not convinced that he esteems me\\r\\nand thinks highly of me. I would not marry him if I were not firmly\\r\\nconvinced that I can respect him. Fortunately, I can have convincing\\r\\nproof of it this very day... and such a marriage is not a vileness, as\\r\\nyou say! And even if you were right, if I really had determined on a\\r\\nvile action, is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that?\\r\\nWhy do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either? It\\r\\nis despotism; it is tyranny. If I ruin anyone, it is only myself.... I\\r\\nam not committing a murder. Why do you look at me like that? Why are you\\r\\nso pale? Rodya, darling, what’s the matter?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens! You have made him faint,” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no, nonsense! It’s nothing. A little giddiness--not fainting. You\\r\\nhave fainting on the brain. H’m, yes, what was I saying? Oh, yes. In\\r\\nwhat way will you get convincing proof to-day that you can respect him,\\r\\nand that he... esteems you, as you said. I think you said to-day?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mother, show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch’s letter,” said Dounia.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith trembling hands, Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave him the letter. He\\r\\ntook it with great interest, but, before opening it, he suddenly looked\\r\\nwith a sort of wonder at Dounia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is strange,” he said, slowly, as though struck by a new idea. “What\\r\\nam I making such a fuss for? What is it all about? Marry whom you like!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and looked for\\r\\nsome time at his sister, as though puzzled. He opened the letter at\\r\\nlast, still with the same look of strange wonder on his face. Then,\\r\\nslowly and attentively, he began reading, and read it through twice.\\r\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna showed marked anxiety, and all indeed expected\\r\\nsomething particular.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What surprises me,” he began, after a short pause, handing the letter\\r\\nto his mother, but not addressing anyone in particular, “is that he is a\\r\\nbusiness man, a lawyer, and his conversation is pretentious indeed, and\\r\\nyet he writes such an uneducated letter.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all started. They had expected something quite different.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But they all write like that, you know,” Razumihin observed, abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you read it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We showed him, Rodya. We... consulted him just now,” Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna began, embarrassed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s just the jargon of the courts,” Razumihin put in. “Legal\\r\\ndocuments are written like that to this day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Legal? Yes, it’s just legal--business language--not so very uneducated,\\r\\nand not quite educated--business language!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap\\r\\neducation, he is proud indeed of having made his own way,” Avdotya\\r\\nRomanovna observed, somewhat offended by her brother’s tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, if he’s proud of it, he has reason, I don’t deny it. You seem to\\r\\nbe offended, sister, at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the\\r\\nletter, and to think that I speak of such trifling matters on purpose to\\r\\nannoy you. It is quite the contrary, an observation apropos of the style\\r\\noccurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand. There\\r\\nis one expression, ‘blame yourselves’ put in very significantly and\\r\\nplainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if I\\r\\nam present. That threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon\\r\\nyou both if you are disobedient, and to abandon you now after summoning\\r\\nyou to Petersburg. Well, what do you think? Can one resent such an\\r\\nexpression from Luzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) had\\r\\nwritten it, or Zossimov, or one of us?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“N-no,” answered Dounia, with more animation. “I saw clearly that it\\r\\nwas too naïvely expressed, and that perhaps he simply has no skill\\r\\nin writing... that is a true criticism, brother. I did not expect,\\r\\nindeed...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than perhaps he\\r\\nintended. But I must disillusion you a little. There is one expression\\r\\nin the letter, one slander about me, and rather a contemptible one. I\\r\\ngave the money last night to the widow, a woman in consumption, crushed\\r\\nwith trouble, and not ‘on the pretext of the funeral,’ but simply to pay\\r\\nfor the funeral, and not to the daughter--a young woman, as he writes,\\r\\nof notorious behaviour (whom I saw last night for the first time in my\\r\\nlife)--but to the widow. In all this I see a too hasty desire to slander\\r\\nme and to raise dissension between us. It is expressed again in legal\\r\\njargon, that is to say, with a too obvious display of the aim, and\\r\\nwith a very naïve eagerness. He is a man of intelligence, but to act\\r\\nsensibly, intelligence is not enough. It all shows the man and... I\\r\\ndon’t think he has a great esteem for you. I tell you this simply to\\r\\nwarn you, because I sincerely wish for your good...”\\r\\n\\r\\nDounia did not reply. Her resolution had been taken. She was only\\r\\nawaiting the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then what is your decision, Rodya?” asked Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who\\r\\nwas more uneasy than ever at the sudden, new businesslike tone of his\\r\\ntalk.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What decision?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You see Pyotr Petrovitch writes that you are not to be with us this\\r\\nevening, and that he will go away if you come. So will you... come?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That, of course, is not for me to decide, but for you first, if you are\\r\\nnot offended by such a request; and secondly, by Dounia, if she, too, is\\r\\nnot offended. I will do what you think best,” he added, drily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dounia has already decided, and I fully agree with her,” Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna hastened to declare.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I decided to ask you, Rodya, to urge you not to fail to be with us at\\r\\nthis interview,” said Dounia. “Will you come?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will ask you, too, to be with us at eight o’clock,” she said,\\r\\naddressing Razumihin. “Mother, I am inviting him, too.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite right, Dounia. Well, since you have decided,” added Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna, “so be it. I shall feel easier myself. I do not like\\r\\nconcealment and deception. Better let us have the whole truth.... Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch may be angry or not, now!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment the door was softly opened, and a young girl walked into\\r\\nthe room, looking timidly about her. Everyone turned towards her with\\r\\nsurprise and curiosity. At first sight, Raskolnikov did not recognise\\r\\nher. It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov. He had seen her yesterday for\\r\\nthe first time, but at such a moment, in such surroundings and in such\\r\\na dress, that his memory retained a very different image of her. Now she\\r\\nwas a modestly and poorly-dressed young girl, very young, indeed,\\r\\nalmost like a child, with a modest and refined manner, with a candid but\\r\\nsomewhat frightened-looking face. She was wearing a very plain indoor\\r\\ndress, and had on a shabby old-fashioned hat, but she still carried a\\r\\nparasol. Unexpectedly finding the room full of people, she was not so\\r\\nmuch embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness, like a\\r\\nlittle child. She was even about to retreat. “Oh... it’s you!” said\\r\\nRaskolnikov, extremely astonished, and he, too, was confused. He at once\\r\\nrecollected that his mother and sister knew through Luzhin’s letter\\r\\nof “some young woman of notorious behaviour.” He had only just been\\r\\nprotesting against Luzhin’s calumny and declaring that he had seen the\\r\\ngirl last night for the first time, and suddenly she had walked in. He\\r\\nremembered, too, that he had not protested against the expression “of\\r\\nnotorious behaviour.” All this passed vaguely and fleetingly through\\r\\nhis brain, but looking at her more intently, he saw that the humiliated\\r\\ncreature was so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her. When she\\r\\nmade a movement to retreat in terror, it sent a pang to his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I did not expect you,” he said, hurriedly, with a look that made her\\r\\nstop. “Please sit down. You come, no doubt, from Katerina Ivanovna.\\r\\nAllow me--not there. Sit here....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Sonia’s entrance, Razumihin, who had been sitting on one of\\r\\nRaskolnikov’s three chairs, close to the door, got up to allow her to\\r\\nenter. Raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where\\r\\nZossimov had been sitting, but feeling that the sofa which served him\\r\\nas a bed, was too _familiar_ a place, he hurriedly motioned her to\\r\\nRazumihin’s chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You sit here,” he said to Razumihin, putting him on the sofa.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked timidly at the\\r\\ntwo ladies. It was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she\\r\\ncould sit down beside them. At the thought of it, she was so frightened\\r\\nthat she hurriedly got up again, and in utter confusion addressed\\r\\nRaskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I... I... have come for one minute. Forgive me for disturbing you,” she\\r\\nbegan falteringly. “I come from Katerina Ivanovna, and she had no one to\\r\\nsend. Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg you... to be at the service... in\\r\\nthe morning... at Mitrofanievsky... and then... to us... to her...\\r\\nto do her the honour... she told me to beg you...” Sonia stammered and\\r\\nceased speaking.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will try, certainly, most certainly,” answered Raskolnikov. He,\\r\\ntoo, stood up, and he, too, faltered and could not finish his sentence.\\r\\n“Please sit down,” he said, suddenly. “I want to talk to you. You are\\r\\nperhaps in a hurry, but please, be so kind, spare me two minutes,” and\\r\\nhe drew up a chair for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia sat down again, and again timidly she took a hurried, frightened\\r\\nlook at the two ladies, and dropped her eyes. Raskolnikov’s pale face\\r\\nflushed, a shudder passed over him, his eyes glowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mother,” he said, firmly and insistently, “this is Sofya Semyonovna\\r\\nMarmeladov, the daughter of that unfortunate Mr. Marmeladov, who was run\\r\\nover yesterday before my eyes, and of whom I was just telling you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia, and slightly screwed up\\r\\nher eyes. In spite of her embarrassment before Rodya’s urgent and\\r\\nchallenging look, she could not deny herself that satisfaction. Dounia\\r\\ngazed gravely and intently into the poor girl’s face, and scrutinised\\r\\nher with perplexity. Sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raise\\r\\nher eyes again, but was more embarrassed than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wanted to ask you,” said Raskolnikov, hastily, “how things were\\r\\narranged yesterday. You were not worried by the police, for instance?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, that was all right... it was too evident, the cause of death...\\r\\nthey did not worry us... only the lodgers are angry.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“At the body’s remaining so long. You see it is hot now. So that,\\r\\nto-day, they will carry it to the cemetery, into the chapel, until\\r\\nto-morrow. At first Katerina Ivanovna was unwilling, but now she sees\\r\\nherself that it’s necessary...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To-day, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to-morrow for the\\r\\nservice, and then to be present at the funeral lunch.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She is giving a funeral lunch?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes... just a little.... She told me to thank you very much for helping\\r\\nus yesterday. But for you, we should have had nothing for the funeral.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAll at once her lips and chin began trembling, but, with an effort, she\\r\\ncontrolled herself, looking down again.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the conversation, Raskolnikov watched her carefully. She had a\\r\\nthin, very thin, pale little face, rather irregular and angular, with a\\r\\nsharp little nose and chin. She could not have been called pretty, but\\r\\nher blue eyes were so clear, and when they lighted up, there was such\\r\\na kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help\\r\\nbeing attracted. Her face, and her whole figure indeed, had another\\r\\npeculiar characteristic. In spite of her eighteen years, she looked\\r\\nalmost a little girl--almost a child. And in some of her gestures, this\\r\\nchildishness seemed almost absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But has Katerina Ivanovna been able to manage with such small means?\\r\\nDoes she even mean to have a funeral lunch?” Raskolnikov asked,\\r\\npersistently keeping up the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The coffin will be plain, of course... and everything will be plain, so\\r\\nit won’t cost much. Katerina Ivanovna and I have reckoned it all out, so\\r\\nthat there will be enough left... and Katerina Ivanovna was very anxious\\r\\nit should be so. You know one can’t... it’s a comfort to her... she is\\r\\nlike that, you know....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I understand, I understand... of course... why do you look at my room\\r\\nlike that? My mother has just said it is like a tomb.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You gave us everything yesterday,” Sonia said suddenly, in reply, in a\\r\\nloud rapid whisper; and again she looked down in confusion. Her lips\\r\\nand chin were trembling once more. She had been struck at once\\r\\nby Raskolnikov’s poor surroundings, and now these words broke out\\r\\nspontaneously. A silence followed. There was a light in Dounia’s eyes,\\r\\nand even Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rodya,” she said, getting up, “we shall have dinner together, of\\r\\ncourse. Come, Dounia.... And you, Rodya, had better go for a little\\r\\nwalk, and then rest and lie down before you come to see us.... I am\\r\\nafraid we have exhausted you....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes, I’ll come,” he answered, getting up fussily. “But I have\\r\\nsomething to see to.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But surely you will have dinner together?” cried Razumihin, looking in\\r\\nsurprise at Raskolnikov. “What do you mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes, I am coming... of course, of course! And you stay a minute.\\r\\nYou do not want him just now, do you, mother? Or perhaps I am taking him\\r\\nfrom you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no, no. And will you, Dmitri Prokofitch, do us the favour of dining\\r\\nwith us?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Please do,” added Dounia.\\r\\n\\r\\nRazumihin bowed, positively radiant. For one moment, they were all\\r\\nstrangely embarrassed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-bye, Rodya, that is till we meet. I do not like saying good-bye.\\r\\nGood-bye, Nastasya. Ah, I have said good-bye again.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna meant to greet Sonia, too; but it somehow failed\\r\\nto come off, and she went in a flutter out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Avdotya Romanovna seemed to await her turn, and following her mother\\r\\nout, gave Sonia an attentive, courteous bow. Sonia, in confusion, gave\\r\\na hurried, frightened curtsy. There was a look of poignant discomfort\\r\\nin her face, as though Avdotya Romanovna’s courtesy and attention were\\r\\noppressive and painful to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dounia, good-bye,” called Raskolnikov, in the passage. “Give me your\\r\\nhand.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, I did give it to you. Have you forgotten?” said Dounia, turning\\r\\nwarmly and awkwardly to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never mind, give it to me again.” And he squeezed her fingers warmly.\\r\\n\\r\\nDounia smiled, flushed, pulled her hand away, and went off quite happy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, that’s capital,” he said to Sonia, going back and looking\\r\\nbrightly at her. “God give peace to the dead, the living have still to\\r\\nlive. That is right, isn’t it?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face. He looked\\r\\nat her for some moments in silence. The whole history of the dead father\\r\\nfloated before his memory in those moments....\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n“Heavens, Dounia,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, as soon as they were in\\r\\nthe street, “I really feel relieved myself at coming away--more at ease.\\r\\nHow little did I think yesterday in the train that I could ever be glad\\r\\nof that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I tell you again, mother, he is still very ill. Don’t you see it?\\r\\nPerhaps worrying about us upset him. We must be patient, and much, much\\r\\ncan be forgiven.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you were not very patient!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna caught her up,\\r\\nhotly and jealously. “Do you know, Dounia, I was looking at you two. You\\r\\nare the very portrait of him, and not so much in face as in soul. You\\r\\nare both melancholy, both morose and hot-tempered, both haughty and both\\r\\ngenerous.... Surely he can’t be an egoist, Dounia. Eh? When I think of\\r\\nwhat is in store for us this evening, my heart sinks!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t be uneasy, mother. What must be, will be.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dounia, only think what a position we are in! What if Pyotr Petrovitch\\r\\nbreaks it off?” poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna blurted out, incautiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He won’t be worth much if he does,” answered Dounia, sharply and\\r\\ncontemptuously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We did well to come away,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly broke in.\\r\\n“He was in a hurry about some business or other. If he gets out and has\\r\\na breath of air... it is fearfully close in his room.... But where is\\r\\none to get a breath of air here? The very streets here feel like shut-up\\r\\nrooms. Good heavens! what a town!... stay... this side... they will\\r\\ncrush you--carrying something. Why, it is a piano they have got, I\\r\\ndeclare... how they push!... I am very much afraid of that young woman,\\r\\ntoo.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What young woman, mother?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, that Sofya Semyonovna, who was there just now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have a presentiment, Dounia. Well, you may believe it or not, but\\r\\nas soon as she came in, that very minute, I felt that she was the chief\\r\\ncause of the trouble....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing of the sort!” cried Dounia, in vexation. “What nonsense, with\\r\\nyour presentiments, mother! He only made her acquaintance the evening\\r\\nbefore, and he did not know her when she came in.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you will see.... She worries me; but you will see, you will\\r\\nsee! I was so frightened. She was gazing at me with those eyes. I could\\r\\nscarcely sit still in my chair when he began introducing her, do you\\r\\nremember? It seems so strange, but Pyotr Petrovitch writes like that\\r\\nabout her, and he introduces her to us--to you! So he must think a great\\r\\ndeal of her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“People will write anything. We were talked about and written about,\\r\\ntoo. Have you forgotten? I am sure that she is a good girl, and that it\\r\\nis all nonsense.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“God grant it may be!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And Pyotr Petrovitch is a contemptible slanderer,” Dounia snapped out,\\r\\nsuddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was crushed; the conversation was not resumed.\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you what I want with you,” said Raskolnikov, drawing\\r\\nRazumihin to the window.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I will tell Katerina Ivanovna that you are coming,” Sonia said\\r\\nhurriedly, preparing to depart.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One minute, Sofya Semyonovna. We have no secrets. You are not in our\\r\\nway. I want to have another word or two with you. Listen!” he turned\\r\\nsuddenly to Razumihin again. “You know that... what’s his name...\\r\\nPorfiry Petrovitch?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should think so! He is a relation. Why?” added the latter, with\\r\\ninterest.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is not he managing that case... you know, about that murder?... You\\r\\nwere speaking about it yesterday.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes... well?” Razumihin’s eyes opened wide.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He was inquiring for people who had pawned things, and I have some\\r\\npledges there, too--trifles--a ring my sister gave me as a keepsake when\\r\\nI left home, and my father’s silver watch--they are only worth five or\\r\\nsix roubles altogether... but I value them. So what am I to do now? I\\r\\ndo not want to lose the things, especially the watch. I was quaking just\\r\\nnow, for fear mother would ask to look at it, when we spoke of Dounia’s\\r\\nwatch. It is the only thing of father’s left us. She would be ill if\\r\\nit were lost. You know what women are. So tell me what to do. I know I\\r\\nought to have given notice at the police station, but would it not be\\r\\nbetter to go straight to Porfiry? Eh? What do you think? The matter\\r\\nmight be settled more quickly. You see, mother may ask for it before\\r\\ndinner.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly not to the police station. Certainly to Porfiry,” Razumihin\\r\\nshouted in extraordinary excitement. “Well, how glad I am. Let us go at\\r\\nonce. It is a couple of steps. We shall be sure to find him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very well, let us go.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And he will be very, very glad to make your acquaintance. I have\\r\\noften talked to him of you at different times. I was speaking of you\\r\\nyesterday. Let us go. So you knew the old woman? So that’s it! It is all\\r\\nturning out splendidly.... Oh, yes, Sofya Ivanovna...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sofya Semyonovna,” corrected Raskolnikov. “Sofya Semyonovna, this is my\\r\\nfriend Razumihin, and he is a good man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you have to go now,” Sonia was beginning, not looking at Razumihin\\r\\nat all, and still more embarrassed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let us go,” decided Raskolnikov. “I will come to you to-day, Sofya\\r\\nSemyonovna. Only tell me where you live.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not exactly ill at ease, but seemed hurried, and avoided her\\r\\neyes. Sonia gave her address, and flushed as she did so. They all went\\r\\nout together.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you lock up?” asked Razumihin, following him on to the stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never,” answered Raskolnikov. “I have been meaning to buy a lock for\\r\\nthese two years. People are happy who have no need of locks,” he said,\\r\\nlaughing, to Sonia. They stood still in the gateway.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you go to the right, Sofya Semyonovna? How did you find me, by the\\r\\nway?” he added, as though he wanted to say something quite different. He\\r\\nwanted to look at her soft clear eyes, but this was not easy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, you gave your address to Polenka yesterday.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Polenka? Oh, yes; Polenka, that is the little girl. She is your sister?\\r\\nDid I give her the address?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, had you forgotten?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I remember.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had heard my father speak of you... only I did not know your name,\\r\\nand he did not know it. And now I came... and as I had learnt your name,\\r\\nI asked to-day, ‘Where does Mr. Raskolnikov live?’ I did not know you\\r\\nhad only a room too.... Good-bye, I will tell Katerina Ivanovna.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was extremely glad to escape at last; she went away looking down,\\r\\nhurrying to get out of sight as soon as possible, to walk the twenty\\r\\nsteps to the turning on the right and to be at last alone, and then\\r\\nmoving rapidly along, looking at no one, noticing nothing, to think, to\\r\\nremember, to meditate on every word, every detail. Never, never had she\\r\\nfelt anything like this. Dimly and unconsciously a whole new world was\\r\\nopening before her. She remembered suddenly that Raskolnikov meant to\\r\\ncome to her that day, perhaps at once!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only not to-day, please, not to-day!” she kept muttering with a sinking\\r\\nheart, as though entreating someone, like a frightened child. “Mercy! to\\r\\nme... to that room... he will see... oh, dear!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who\\r\\nwas watching her and following at her heels. He had accompanied her from\\r\\nthe gateway. At the moment when Razumihin, Raskolnikov, and she stood\\r\\nstill at parting on the pavement, this gentleman, who was just passing,\\r\\nstarted on hearing Sonia’s words: “and I asked where Mr. Raskolnikov\\r\\nlived?” He turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three, especially\\r\\nupon Raskolnikov, to whom Sonia was speaking; then looked back and noted\\r\\nthe house. All this was done in an instant as he passed, and trying not\\r\\nto betray his interest, he walked on more slowly as though waiting for\\r\\nsomething. He was waiting for Sonia; he saw that they were parting, and\\r\\nthat Sonia was going home.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Home? Where? I’ve seen that face somewhere,” he thought. “I must find\\r\\nout.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the turning he crossed over, looked round, and saw Sonia coming the\\r\\nsame way, noticing nothing. She turned the corner. He followed her on\\r\\nthe other side. After about fifty paces he crossed over again, overtook\\r\\nher and kept two or three yards behind her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a man about fifty, rather tall and thickly set, with broad high\\r\\nshoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little. He wore\\r\\ngood and fashionable clothes, and looked like a gentleman of position.\\r\\nHe carried a handsome cane, which he tapped on the pavement at each\\r\\nstep; his gloves were spotless. He had a broad, rather pleasant face\\r\\nwith high cheek-bones and a fresh colour, not often seen in Petersburg.\\r\\nHis flaxen hair was still abundant, and only touched here and there with\\r\\ngrey, and his thick square beard was even lighter than his hair.\\r\\nHis eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look; his lips were\\r\\ncrimson. He was a remarkedly well-preserved man and looked much younger\\r\\nthan his years.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Sonia came out on the canal bank, they were the only two persons on\\r\\nthe pavement. He observed her dreaminess and preoccupation. On reaching\\r\\nthe house where she lodged, Sonia turned in at the gate; he followed\\r\\nher, seeming rather surprised. In the courtyard she turned to the right\\r\\ncorner. “Bah!” muttered the unknown gentleman, and mounted the stairs\\r\\nbehind her. Only then Sonia noticed him. She reached the third storey,\\r\\nturned down the passage, and rang at No. 9. On the door was inscribed\\r\\nin chalk, “Kapernaumov, Tailor.” “Bah!” the stranger repeated again,\\r\\nwondering at the strange coincidence, and he rang next door, at No. 8.\\r\\nThe doors were two or three yards apart.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You lodge at Kapernaumov’s,” he said, looking at Sonia and laughing.\\r\\n“He altered a waistcoat for me yesterday. I am staying close here at\\r\\nMadame Resslich’s. How odd!” Sonia looked at him attentively.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are neighbours,” he went on gaily. “I only came to town the day\\r\\nbefore yesterday. Good-bye for the present.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia made no reply; the door opened and she slipped in. She felt for\\r\\nsome reason ashamed and uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the way to Porfiry’s, Razumihin was obviously excited.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s capital, brother,” he repeated several times, “and I am glad! I\\r\\nam glad!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you glad about?” Raskolnikov thought to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I didn’t know that you pledged things at the old woman’s, too. And...\\r\\nwas it long ago? I mean, was it long since you were there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a simple-hearted fool he is!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When was it?” Raskolnikov stopped still to recollect. “Two or three\\r\\ndays before her death it must have been. But I am not going to redeem\\r\\nthe things now,” he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous\\r\\nsolicitude about the things. “I’ve not more than a silver rouble\\r\\nleft... after last night’s accursed delirium!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laid special emphasis on the delirium.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes,” Razumihin hastened to agree--with what was not clear. “Then\\r\\nthat’s why you... were stuck... partly... you know in your delirium you\\r\\nwere continually mentioning some rings or chains! Yes, yes... that’s\\r\\nclear, it’s all clear now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hullo! How that idea must have got about among them. Here this man will\\r\\ngo to the stake for me, and I find him delighted at having it _cleared\\r\\nup_ why I spoke of rings in my delirium! What a hold the idea must have\\r\\non all of them!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shall we find him?” he asked suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes,” Razumihin answered quickly. “He is a nice fellow, you will\\r\\nsee, brother. Rather clumsy, that is to say, he is a man of polished\\r\\nmanners, but I mean clumsy in a different sense. He is an intelligent\\r\\nfellow, very much so indeed, but he has his own range of ideas.... He\\r\\nis incredulous, sceptical, cynical... he likes to impose on people, or\\r\\nrather to make fun of them. His is the old, circumstantial method....\\r\\nBut he understands his work... thoroughly.... Last year he cleared up a\\r\\ncase of murder in which the police had hardly a clue. He is very, very\\r\\nanxious to make your acquaintance!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“On what grounds is he so anxious?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, it’s not exactly... you see, since you’ve been ill I happen to have\\r\\nmentioned you several times.... So, when he heard about you... about\\r\\nyour being a law student and not able to finish your studies, he said,\\r\\n‘What a pity!’ And so I concluded... from everything together, not only\\r\\nthat; yesterday Zametov... you know, Rodya, I talked some nonsense on\\r\\nthe way home to you yesterday, when I was drunk... I am afraid, brother,\\r\\nof your exaggerating it, you see.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What? That they think I am a madman? Maybe they are right,” he said\\r\\nwith a constrained smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes.... That is, pooh, no!... But all that I said (and there was\\r\\nsomething else too) it was all nonsense, drunken nonsense.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But why are you apologising? I am so sick of it all!” Raskolnikov cried\\r\\nwith exaggerated irritability. It was partly assumed, however.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know, I know, I understand. Believe me, I understand. One’s ashamed\\r\\nto speak of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you are ashamed, then don’t speak of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth were silent. Razumihin was more than ecstatic and Raskolnikov\\r\\nperceived it with repulsion. He was alarmed, too, by what Razumihin had\\r\\njust said about Porfiry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall have to pull a long face with him too,” he thought, with a\\r\\nbeating heart, and he turned white, “and do it naturally, too. But the\\r\\nmost natural thing would be to do nothing at all. Carefully do nothing\\r\\nat all! No, _carefully_ would not be natural again.... Oh, well, we\\r\\nshall see how it turns out.... We shall see... directly. Is it a good\\r\\nthing to go or not? The butterfly flies to the light. My heart is\\r\\nbeating, that’s what’s bad!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In this grey house,” said Razumihin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The most important thing, does Porfiry know that I was at the old\\r\\nhag’s flat yesterday... and asked about the blood? I must find that out\\r\\ninstantly, as soon as I go in, find out from his face; otherwise... I’ll\\r\\nfind out, if it’s my ruin.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say, brother,” he said suddenly, addressing Razumihin, with a sly\\r\\nsmile, “I have been noticing all day that you seem to be curiously\\r\\nexcited. Isn’t it so?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excited? Not a bit of it,” said Razumihin, stung to the quick.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, brother, I assure you it’s noticeable. Why, you sat on your chair\\r\\nin a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, and you seemed to be\\r\\nwrithing all the time. You kept jumping up for nothing. One moment you\\r\\nwere angry, and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat. You even\\r\\nblushed; especially when you were invited to dinner, you blushed\\r\\nawfully.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing of the sort, nonsense! What do you mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But why are you wriggling out of it, like a schoolboy? By Jove, there\\r\\nhe’s blushing again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a pig you are!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But why are you so shamefaced about it? Romeo! Stay, I’ll tell of you\\r\\nto-day. Ha-ha-ha! I’ll make mother laugh, and someone else, too...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen, listen, listen, this is serious.... What next, you fiend!”\\r\\n Razumihin was utterly overwhelmed, turning cold with horror. “What will\\r\\nyou tell them? Come, brother... foo! what a pig you are!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are like a summer rose. And if only you knew how it suits you; a\\r\\nRomeo over six foot high! And how you’ve washed to-day--you cleaned your\\r\\nnails, I declare. Eh? That’s something unheard of! Why, I do believe\\r\\nyou’ve got pomatum on your hair! Bend down.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pig!”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov laughed as though he could not restrain himself. So\\r\\nlaughing, they entered Porfiry Petrovitch’s flat. This is what\\r\\nRaskolnikov wanted: from within they could be heard laughing as they\\r\\ncame in, still guffawing in the passage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a word here or I’ll... brain you!” Razumihin whispered furiously,\\r\\nseizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov was already entering the room. He came in looking as though\\r\\nhe had the utmost difficulty not to burst out laughing again. Behind him\\r\\nRazumihin strode in gawky and awkward, shamefaced and red as a peony,\\r\\nwith an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression. His face and\\r\\nwhole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justified\\r\\nRaskolnikov’s laughter. Raskolnikov, not waiting for an introduction,\\r\\nbowed to Porfiry Petrovitch, who stood in the middle of the room\\r\\nlooking inquiringly at them. He held out his hand and shook hands, still\\r\\napparently making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a few\\r\\nwords to introduce himself. But he had no sooner succeeded in assuming\\r\\na serious air and muttering something when he suddenly glanced again as\\r\\nthough accidentally at Razumihin, and could no longer control himself:\\r\\nhis stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried\\r\\nto restrain it. The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumihin received\\r\\nthis “spontaneous” mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of most\\r\\ngenuine fun and naturalness. Razumihin strengthened this impression as\\r\\nthough on purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fool! You fiend,” he roared, waving his arm which at once struck a\\r\\nlittle round table with an empty tea-glass on it. Everything was sent\\r\\nflying and crashing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But why break chairs, gentlemen? You know it’s a loss to the Crown,”\\r\\n Porfiry Petrovitch quoted gaily.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov was still laughing, with his hand in Porfiry Petrovitch’s,\\r\\nbut anxious not to overdo it, awaited the right moment to put a natural\\r\\nend to it. Razumihin, completely put to confusion by upsetting the table\\r\\nand smashing the glass, gazed gloomily at the fragments, cursed and\\r\\nturned sharply to the window where he stood looking out with his back\\r\\nto the company with a fiercely scowling countenance, seeing nothing.\\r\\nPorfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready to go on laughing, but\\r\\nobviously looked for explanations. Zametov had been sitting in the\\r\\ncorner, but he rose at the visitors’ entrance and was standing in\\r\\nexpectation with a smile on his lips, though he looked with surprise and\\r\\neven it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov with a\\r\\ncertain embarrassment. Zametov’s unexpected presence struck Raskolnikov\\r\\nunpleasantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve got to think of that,” he thought. “Excuse me, please,” he began,\\r\\naffecting extreme embarrassment. “Raskolnikov.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at all, very pleasant to see you... and how pleasantly you’ve come\\r\\nin.... Why, won’t he even say good-morning?” Porfiry Petrovitch nodded\\r\\nat Razumihin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Upon my honour I don’t know why he is in such a rage with me. I only\\r\\ntold him as we came along that he was like Romeo... and proved it. And\\r\\nthat was all, I think!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pig!” ejaculated Razumihin, without turning round.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There must have been very grave grounds for it, if he is so furious at\\r\\nthe word,” Porfiry laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you sharp lawyer!... Damn you all!” snapped Razumihin, and suddenly\\r\\nbursting out laughing himself, he went up to Porfiry with a more\\r\\ncheerful face as though nothing had happened. “That’ll do! We are\\r\\nall fools. To come to business. This is my friend Rodion Romanovitch\\r\\nRaskolnikov; in the first place he has heard of you and wants to make\\r\\nyour acquaintance, and secondly, he has a little matter of business with\\r\\nyou. Bah! Zametov, what brought you here? Have you met before? Have you\\r\\nknown each other long?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What does this mean?” thought Raskolnikov uneasily.\\r\\n\\r\\nZametov seemed taken aback, but not very much so.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, it was at your rooms we met yesterday,” he said easily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I have been spared the trouble. All last week he was begging me\\r\\nto introduce him to you. Porfiry and you have sniffed each other out\\r\\nwithout me. Where is your tobacco?”\\r\\n\\r\\nPorfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very clean linen, and\\r\\ntrodden-down slippers. He was a man of about five and thirty, short,\\r\\nstout even to corpulence, and clean shaven. He wore his hair cut short\\r\\nand had a large round head, particularly prominent at the back. His\\r\\nsoft, round, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour,\\r\\nbut had a vigorous and rather ironical expression. It would have been\\r\\ngood-natured except for a look in the eyes, which shone with a watery,\\r\\nmawkish light under almost white, blinking eyelashes. The expression\\r\\nof those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish\\r\\nfigure, and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed at\\r\\nfirst sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matter\\r\\nof business with him, he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down\\r\\nhimself on the other end, waiting for him to explain his business, with\\r\\nthat careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and\\r\\nembarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if what you are\\r\\ndiscussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such\\r\\nexceptional solemnity. But in brief and coherent phrases Raskolnikov\\r\\nexplained his business clearly and exactly, and was so well satisfied\\r\\nwith himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry.\\r\\nPorfiry Petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him. Razumihin,\\r\\nsitting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and impatiently,\\r\\nlooking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive\\r\\ninterest.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fool,” Raskolnikov swore to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have to give information to the police,” Porfiry replied, with a\\r\\nmost businesslike air, “that having learnt of this incident, that is of\\r\\nthe murder, you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such\\r\\nand such things belong to you, and that you desire to redeem them...\\r\\nor... but they will write to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s just the point, that at the present moment,” Raskolnikov tried\\r\\nhis utmost to feign embarrassment, “I am not quite in funds... and\\r\\neven this trifling sum is beyond me... I only wanted, you see, for\\r\\nthe present to declare that the things are mine, and that when I have\\r\\nmoney....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s no matter,” answered Porfiry Petrovitch, receiving his\\r\\nexplanation of his pecuniary position coldly, “but you can, if you\\r\\nprefer, write straight to me, to say, that having been informed of the\\r\\nmatter, and claiming such and such as your property, you beg...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“On an ordinary sheet of paper?” Raskolnikov interrupted eagerly, again\\r\\ninterested in the financial side of the question.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, the most ordinary,” and suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch looked with\\r\\nobvious irony at him, screwing up his eyes and, as it were, winking at\\r\\nhim. But perhaps it was Raskolnikov’s fancy, for it all lasted but a\\r\\nmoment. There was certainly something of the sort, Raskolnikov could\\r\\nhave sworn he winked at him, goodness knows why.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He knows,” flashed through his mind like lightning.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Forgive my troubling you about such trifles,” he went on, a little\\r\\ndisconcerted, “the things are only worth five roubles, but I prize them\\r\\nparticularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me, and I must\\r\\nconfess that I was alarmed when I heard...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s why you were so much struck when I mentioned to Zossimov that\\r\\nPorfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges!” Razumihin put in\\r\\nwith obvious intention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was really unbearable. Raskolnikov could not help glancing at him\\r\\nwith a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes, but immediately\\r\\nrecollected himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You seem to be jeering at me, brother?” he said to him, with a\\r\\nwell-feigned irritability. “I dare say I do seem to you absurdly anxious\\r\\nabout such trash; but you mustn’t think me selfish or grasping for that,\\r\\nand these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes. I told you\\r\\njust now that the silver watch, though it’s not worth a cent, is the\\r\\nonly thing left us of my father’s. You may laugh at me, but my mother is\\r\\nhere,” he turned suddenly to Porfiry, “and if she knew,” he turned again\\r\\nhurriedly to Razumihin, carefully making his voice tremble, “that the\\r\\nwatch was lost, she would be in despair! You know what women are!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a bit of it! I didn’t mean that at all! Quite the contrary!”\\r\\n shouted Razumihin distressed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was it right? Was it natural? Did I overdo it?” Raskolnikov asked\\r\\nhimself in a tremor. “Why did I say that about women?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, your mother is with you?” Porfiry Petrovitch inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When did she come?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Last night.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPorfiry paused as though reflecting.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your things would not in any case be lost,” he went on calmly and\\r\\ncoldly. “I have been expecting you here for some time.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as though that was a matter of no importance, he carefully offered\\r\\nthe ash-tray to Razumihin, who was ruthlessly scattering cigarette ash\\r\\nover the carpet. Raskolnikov shuddered, but Porfiry did not seem to be\\r\\nlooking at him, and was still concerned with Razumihin’s cigarette.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What? Expecting him? Why, did you know that he had pledges _there_?”\\r\\n cried Razumihin.\\r\\n\\r\\nPorfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped up together, and on\\r\\nthe paper your name was legibly written in pencil, together with the\\r\\ndate on which you left them with her...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How observant you are!” Raskolnikov smiled awkwardly, doing his very\\r\\nutmost to look him straight in the face, but he failed, and suddenly\\r\\nadded:\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say that because I suppose there were a great many pledges... that it\\r\\nmust be difficult to remember them all.... But you remember them all so\\r\\nclearly, and... and...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stupid! Feeble!” he thought. “Why did I add that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But we know all who had pledges, and you are the only one who hasn’t\\r\\ncome forward,” Porfiry answered with hardly perceptible irony.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I haven’t been quite well.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I heard that too. I heard, indeed, that you were in great distress\\r\\nabout something. You look pale still.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am not pale at all.... No, I am quite well,” Raskolnikov snapped\\r\\nout rudely and angrily, completely changing his tone. His anger was\\r\\nmounting, he could not repress it. “And in my anger I shall betray\\r\\nmyself,” flashed through his mind again. “Why are they torturing me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not quite well!” Razumihin caught him up. “What next! He was\\r\\nunconscious and delirious all yesterday. Would you believe, Porfiry, as\\r\\nsoon as our backs were turned, he dressed, though he could hardly stand,\\r\\nand gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight,\\r\\ndelirious all the time! Would you believe it! Extraordinary!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Really delirious? You don’t say so!” Porfiry shook his head in a\\r\\nwomanish way.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nonsense! Don’t you believe it! But you don’t believe it anyway,”\\r\\n Raskolnikov let slip in his anger. But Porfiry Petrovitch did not seem\\r\\nto catch those strange words.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But how could you have gone out if you hadn’t been delirious?”\\r\\n Razumihin got hot suddenly. “What did you go out for? What was the\\r\\nobject of it? And why on the sly? Were you in your senses when you did\\r\\nit? Now that all danger is over I can speak plainly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was awfully sick of them yesterday.” Raskolnikov addressed Porfiry\\r\\nsuddenly with a smile of insolent defiance, “I ran away from them to\\r\\ntake lodgings where they wouldn’t find me, and took a lot of money with\\r\\nme. Mr. Zametov there saw it. I say, Mr. Zametov, was I sensible or\\r\\ndelirious yesterday; settle our dispute.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could have strangled Zametov at that moment, so hateful were his\\r\\nexpression and his silence to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully, but you were\\r\\nextremely irritable,” Zametov pronounced dryly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And Nikodim Fomitch was telling me to-day,” put in Porfiry Petrovitch,\\r\\n“that he met you very late last night in the lodging of a man who had\\r\\nbeen run over.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And there,” said Razumihin, “weren’t you mad then? You gave your last\\r\\npenny to the widow for the funeral. If you wanted to help, give fifteen\\r\\nor twenty even, but keep three roubles for yourself at least, but he\\r\\nflung away all the twenty-five at once!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Maybe I found a treasure somewhere and you know nothing of it? So\\r\\nthat’s why I was liberal yesterday.... Mr. Zametov knows I’ve found a\\r\\ntreasure! Excuse us, please, for disturbing you for half an hour\\r\\nwith such trivialities,” he said, turning to Porfiry Petrovitch, with\\r\\ntrembling lips. “We are boring you, aren’t we?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh no, quite the contrary, quite the contrary! If only you knew how you\\r\\ninterest me! It’s interesting to look on and listen... and I am really\\r\\nglad you have come forward at last.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you might give us some tea! My throat’s dry,” cried Razumihin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Capital idea! Perhaps we will all keep you company. Wouldn’t you\\r\\nlike... something more essential before tea?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get along with you!”\\r\\n\\r\\nPorfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov’s thoughts were in a whirl. He was in terrible exasperation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The worst of it is they don’t disguise it; they don’t care to stand on\\r\\nceremony! And how if you didn’t know me at all, did you come to talk\\r\\nto Nikodim Fomitch about me? So they don’t care to hide that they are\\r\\ntracking me like a pack of dogs. They simply spit in my face.” He was\\r\\nshaking with rage. “Come, strike me openly, don’t play with me like a\\r\\ncat with a mouse. It’s hardly civil, Porfiry Petrovitch, but perhaps I\\r\\nwon’t allow it! I shall get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly\\r\\nfaces, and you’ll see how I despise you.” He could hardly breathe.\\r\\n“And what if it’s only my fancy? What if I am mistaken, and through\\r\\ninexperience I get angry and don’t keep up my nasty part? Perhaps it’s\\r\\nall unintentional. All their phrases are the usual ones, but there is\\r\\nsomething about them.... It all might be said, but there is something.\\r\\nWhy did he say bluntly, ‘With her’? Why did Zametov add that I spoke\\r\\nartfully? Why do they speak in that tone? Yes, the tone.... Razumihin\\r\\nis sitting here, why does he see nothing? That innocent blockhead never\\r\\ndoes see anything! Feverish again! Did Porfiry wink at me just now? Of\\r\\ncourse it’s nonsense! What could he wink for? Are they trying to upset\\r\\nmy nerves or are they teasing me? Either it’s ill fancy or they know!\\r\\nEven Zametov is rude.... Is Zametov rude? Zametov has changed his mind.\\r\\nI foresaw he would change his mind! He is at home here, while it’s my\\r\\nfirst visit. Porfiry does not consider him a visitor; sits with his back\\r\\nto him. They’re as thick as thieves, no doubt, over me! Not a doubt they\\r\\nwere talking about me before we came. Do they know about the flat? If\\r\\nonly they’d make haste! When I said that I ran away to take a flat he\\r\\nlet it pass.... I put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of use\\r\\nafterwards.... Delirious, indeed... ha-ha-ha! He knows all about last\\r\\nnight! He didn’t know of my mother’s arrival! The hag had written the\\r\\ndate on in pencil! You are wrong, you won’t catch me! There are no\\r\\nfacts... it’s all supposition! You produce facts! The flat even isn’t a\\r\\nfact but delirium. I know what to say to them.... Do they know about the\\r\\nflat? I won’t go without finding out. What did I come for? But my being\\r\\nangry now, maybe is a fact! Fool, how irritable I am! Perhaps that’s\\r\\nright; to play the invalid.... He is feeling me. He will try to catch\\r\\nme. Why did I come?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this flashed like lightning through his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nPorfiry Petrovitch returned quickly. He became suddenly more jovial.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your party yesterday, brother, has left my head rather.... And I am out\\r\\nof sorts altogether,” he began in quite a different tone, laughing to\\r\\nRazumihin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was it interesting? I left you yesterday at the most interesting point.\\r\\nWho got the best of it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no one, of course. They got on to everlasting questions, floated\\r\\noff into space.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only fancy, Rodya, what we got on to yesterday. Whether there is such a\\r\\nthing as crime. I told you that we talked our heads off.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is there strange? It’s an everyday social question,” Raskolnikov\\r\\nanswered casually.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The question wasn’t put quite like that,” observed Porfiry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not quite, that’s true,” Razumihin agreed at once, getting warm and\\r\\nhurried as usual. “Listen, Rodion, and tell us your opinion, I want to\\r\\nhear it. I was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to\\r\\nhelp me. I told them you were coming.... It began with the socialist\\r\\ndoctrine. You know their doctrine; crime is a protest against the\\r\\nabnormality of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing\\r\\nmore; no other causes admitted!...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are wrong there,” cried Porfiry Petrovitch; he was noticeably\\r\\nanimated and kept laughing as he looked at Razumihin, which made him\\r\\nmore excited than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing is admitted,” Razumihin interrupted with heat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am not wrong. I’ll show you their pamphlets. Everything with them\\r\\nis ‘the influence of environment,’ and nothing else. Their favourite\\r\\nphrase! From which it follows that, if society is normally organised,\\r\\nall crime will cease at once, since there will be nothing to protest\\r\\nagainst and all men will become righteous in one instant. Human nature\\r\\nis not taken into account, it is excluded, it’s not supposed to exist!\\r\\nThey don’t recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living\\r\\nprocess, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a\\r\\nsocial system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going\\r\\nto organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an\\r\\ninstant, quicker than any living process! That’s why they instinctively\\r\\ndislike history, ‘nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,’ and they\\r\\nexplain it all as stupidity! That’s why they so dislike the _living_\\r\\nprocess of life; they don’t want a _living soul_! The living soul\\r\\ndemands life, the soul won’t obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an\\r\\nobject of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! But what they want though\\r\\nit smells of death and can be made of India-rubber, at least is not\\r\\nalive, has no will, is servile and won’t revolt! And it comes in the end\\r\\nto their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning\\r\\nof rooms and passages in a phalanstery! The phalanstery is ready,\\r\\nindeed, but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery--it\\r\\nwants life, it hasn’t completed its vital process, it’s too soon for the\\r\\ngraveyard! You can’t skip over nature by logic. Logic presupposes three\\r\\npossibilities, but there are millions! Cut away a million, and reduce\\r\\nit all to the question of comfort! That’s the easiest solution of the\\r\\nproblem! It’s seductively clear and you musn’t think about it. That’s\\r\\nthe great thing, you mustn’t think! The whole secret of life in two\\r\\npages of print!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now he is off, beating the drum! Catch hold of him, do!” laughed\\r\\nPorfiry. “Can you imagine,” he turned to Raskolnikov, “six people\\r\\nholding forth like that last night, in one room, with punch as a\\r\\npreliminary! No, brother, you are wrong, environment accounts for a\\r\\ngreat deal in crime; I can assure you of that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I know it does, but just tell me: a man of forty violates a child\\r\\nof ten; was it environment drove him to it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, strictly speaking, it did,” Porfiry observed with noteworthy\\r\\ngravity; “a crime of that nature may be very well ascribed to the\\r\\ninfluence of environment.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRazumihin was almost in a frenzy. “Oh, if you like,” he roared. “I’ll\\r\\nprove to you that your white eyelashes may very well be ascribed to the\\r\\nChurch of Ivan the Great’s being two hundred and fifty feet high, and I\\r\\nwill prove it clearly, exactly, progressively, and even with a Liberal\\r\\ntendency! I undertake to! Will you bet on it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Done! Let’s hear, please, how he will prove it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is always humbugging, confound him,” cried Razumihin, jumping up and\\r\\ngesticulating. “What’s the use of talking to you? He does all that\\r\\non purpose; you don’t know him, Rodion! He took their side yesterday,\\r\\nsimply to make fools of them. And the things he said yesterday! And they\\r\\nwere delighted! He can keep it up for a fortnight together. Last year he\\r\\npersuaded us that he was going into a monastery: he stuck to it for two\\r\\nmonths. Not long ago he took it into his head to declare he was going\\r\\nto get married, that he had everything ready for the wedding. He ordered\\r\\nnew clothes indeed. We all began to congratulate him. There was no\\r\\nbride, nothing, all pure fantasy!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, you are wrong! I got the clothes before. It was the new clothes in\\r\\nfact that made me think of taking you in.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you such a good dissembler?” Raskolnikov asked carelessly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You wouldn’t have supposed it, eh? Wait a bit, I shall take you in,\\r\\ntoo. Ha-ha-ha! No, I’ll tell you the truth. All these questions about\\r\\ncrime, environment, children, recall to my mind an article of yours\\r\\nwhich interested me at the time. ‘On Crime’... or something of the\\r\\nsort, I forget the title, I read it with pleasure two months ago in the\\r\\n_Periodical Review_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My article? In the _Periodical Review_?” Raskolnikov asked in\\r\\nastonishment. “I certainly did write an article upon a book six months\\r\\nago when I left the university, but I sent it to the _Weekly Review_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it came out in the _Periodical_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the _Weekly Review_ ceased to exist, so that’s why it wasn’t\\r\\nprinted at the time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s true; but when it ceased to exist, the _Weekly Review_ was\\r\\namalgamated with the _Periodical_, and so your article appeared two\\r\\nmonths ago in the latter. Didn’t you know?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov had not known.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, you might get some money out of them for the article! What a\\r\\nstrange person you are! You lead such a solitary life that you know\\r\\nnothing of matters that concern you directly. It’s a fact, I assure\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Bravo, Rodya! I knew nothing about it either!” cried Razumihin. “I’ll\\r\\nrun to-day to the reading-room and ask for the number. Two months ago?\\r\\nWhat was the date? It doesn’t matter though, I will find it. Think of\\r\\nnot telling us!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How did you find out that the article was mine? It’s only signed with\\r\\nan initial.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I only learnt it by chance, the other day. Through the editor; I know\\r\\nhim.... I was very much interested.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I analysed, if I remember, the psychology of a criminal before and\\r\\nafter the crime.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always\\r\\naccompanied by illness. Very, very original, but... it was not that part\\r\\nof your article that interested me so much, but an idea at the end of\\r\\nthe article which I regret to say you merely suggested without working\\r\\nit out clearly. There is, if you recollect, a suggestion that there are\\r\\ncertain persons who can... that is, not precisely are able to, but have\\r\\na perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes, and that the\\r\\nlaw is not for them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of his\\r\\nidea.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What? What do you mean? A right to crime? But not because of the\\r\\ninfluence of environment?” Razumihin inquired with some alarm even.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, not exactly because of it,” answered Porfiry. “In his article all\\r\\nmen are divided into ‘ordinary’ and ‘extraordinary.’ Ordinary men have\\r\\nto live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because,\\r\\ndon’t you see, they are ordinary. But extraordinary men have a right to\\r\\ncommit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because they\\r\\nare extraordinary. That was your idea, if I am not mistaken?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean? That can’t be right?” Razumihin muttered in\\r\\nbewilderment.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov smiled again. He saw the point at once, and knew where they\\r\\nwanted to drive him. He decided to take up the challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That wasn’t quite my contention,” he began simply and modestly. “Yet\\r\\nI admit that you have stated it almost correctly; perhaps, if you like,\\r\\nperfectly so.” (It almost gave him pleasure to admit this.) “The only\\r\\ndifference is that I don’t contend that extraordinary people are always\\r\\nbound to commit breaches of morals, as you call it. In fact, I doubt\\r\\nwhether such an argument could be published. I simply hinted that an\\r\\n‘extraordinary’ man has the right... that is not an official right, but\\r\\nan inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep... certain\\r\\nobstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment\\r\\nof his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity).\\r\\nYou say that my article isn’t definite; I am ready to make it as clear\\r\\nas I can. Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to; very well. I\\r\\nmaintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have\\r\\nbeen made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a\\r\\nhundred, or more men, Newton would have had the right, would indeed have\\r\\nbeen in duty-bound... to _eliminate_ the dozen or the hundred men for\\r\\nthe sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity. But\\r\\nit does not follow from that that Newton had a right to murder people\\r\\nright and left and to steal every day in the market. Then, I remember, I\\r\\nmaintain in my article that all... well, legislators and leaders of men,\\r\\nsuch as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all without\\r\\nexception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they\\r\\ntransgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held\\r\\nsacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either,\\r\\nif that bloodshed--often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence\\r\\nof ancient law--were of use to their cause. It’s remarkable, in fact,\\r\\nthat the majority, indeed, of these benefactors and leaders of humanity\\r\\nwere guilty of terrible carnage. In short, I maintain that all great men\\r\\nor even men a little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving\\r\\nsome new word, must from their very nature be criminals--more or less,\\r\\nof course. Otherwise it’s hard for them to get out of the common rut;\\r\\nand to remain in the common rut is what they can’t submit to, from their\\r\\nvery nature again, and to my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to\\r\\nit. You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that. The\\r\\nsame thing has been printed and read a thousand times before. As for my\\r\\ndivision of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I acknowledge that\\r\\nit’s somewhat arbitrary, but I don’t insist upon exact numbers. I only\\r\\nbelieve in my leading idea that men are _in general_ divided by a law\\r\\nof nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say,\\r\\nmaterial that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who have\\r\\nthe gift or the talent to utter _a new word_. There are, of course,\\r\\ninnumerable sub-divisions, but the distinguishing features of both\\r\\ncategories are fairly well marked. The first category, generally\\r\\nspeaking, are men conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live\\r\\nunder control and love to be controlled. To my thinking it is their duty\\r\\nto be controlled, because that’s their vocation, and there is nothing\\r\\nhumiliating in it for them. The second category all transgress the\\r\\nlaw; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their\\r\\ncapacities. The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied;\\r\\nfor the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the\\r\\npresent for the sake of the better. But if such a one is forced for the\\r\\nsake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he can, I\\r\\nmaintain, find within himself, in his conscience, a sanction for wading\\r\\nthrough blood--that depends on the idea and its dimensions, note that.\\r\\nIt’s only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article\\r\\n(you remember it began with the legal question). There’s no need for\\r\\nsuch anxiety, however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right,\\r\\nthey punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so fulfil\\r\\nquite justly their conservative vocation. But the same masses set these\\r\\ncriminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more or\\r\\nless). The first category is always the man of the present, the second\\r\\nthe man of the future. The first preserve the world and people it, the\\r\\nsecond move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has an equal\\r\\nright to exist. In fact, all have equal rights with me--and _vive la\\r\\nguerre éternelle_--till the New Jerusalem, of course!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you believe in the New Jerusalem, do you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do,” Raskolnikov answered firmly; as he said these words and during\\r\\nthe whole preceding tirade he kept his eyes on one spot on the carpet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And... and do you believe in God? Excuse my curiosity.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do,” repeated Raskolnikov, raising his eyes to Porfiry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And... do you believe in Lazarus’ rising from the dead?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I... I do. Why do you ask all this?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You believe it literally?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Literally.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t say so.... I asked from curiosity. Excuse me. But let us\\r\\ngo back to the question; they are not always executed. Some, on the\\r\\ncontrary...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Triumph in their lifetime? Oh, yes, some attain their ends in this\\r\\nlife, and then...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They begin executing other people?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If it’s necessary; indeed, for the most part they do. Your remark is\\r\\nvery witty.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you. But tell me this: how do you distinguish those extraordinary\\r\\npeople from the ordinary ones? Are there signs at their birth? I feel\\r\\nthere ought to be more exactitude, more external definition. Excuse the\\r\\nnatural anxiety of a practical law-abiding citizen, but couldn’t they\\r\\nadopt a special uniform, for instance, couldn’t they wear something, be\\r\\nbranded in some way? For you know if confusion arises and a member of\\r\\none category imagines that he belongs to the other, begins to ‘eliminate\\r\\nobstacles’ as you so happily expressed it, then...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, that very often happens! That remark is wittier than the other.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No reason to; but take note that the mistake can only arise in\\r\\nthe first category, that is among the ordinary people (as I perhaps\\r\\nunfortunately called them). In spite of their predisposition to\\r\\nobedience very many of them, through a playfulness of nature, sometimes\\r\\nvouchsafed even to the cow, like to imagine themselves advanced people,\\r\\n‘destroyers,’ and to push themselves into the ‘new movement,’ and\\r\\nthis quite sincerely. Meanwhile the really _new_ people are very often\\r\\nunobserved by them, or even despised as reactionaries of grovelling\\r\\ntendencies. But I don’t think there is any considerable danger here,\\r\\nand you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far. Of course,\\r\\nthey might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away\\r\\nwith them and to teach them their place, but no more; in fact, even\\r\\nthis isn’t necessary as they castigate themselves, for they are very\\r\\nconscientious: some perform this service for one another and others\\r\\nchastise themselves with their own hands.... They will impose various\\r\\npublic acts of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying\\r\\neffect; in fact you’ve nothing to be uneasy about.... It’s a law of\\r\\nnature.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score; but\\r\\nthere’s another thing worries me. Tell me, please, are there many people\\r\\nwho have the right to kill others, these extraordinary people? I am\\r\\nready to bow down to them, of course, but you must admit it’s alarming\\r\\nif there are a great many of them, eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you needn’t worry about that either,” Raskolnikov went on in the\\r\\nsame tone. “People with new ideas, people with the faintest capacity for\\r\\nsaying something _new_, are extremely few in number, extraordinarily\\r\\nso in fact. One thing only is clear, that the appearance of all these\\r\\ngrades and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity\\r\\nsome law of nature. That law, of course, is unknown at present, but I am\\r\\nconvinced that it exists, and one day may become known. The vast mass of\\r\\nmankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some great effort,\\r\\nby some mysterious process, by means of some crossing of races and\\r\\nstocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a\\r\\nthousand with a spark of independence. One in ten thousand perhaps--I\\r\\nspeak roughly, approximately--is born with some independence, and with\\r\\nstill greater independence one in a hundred thousand. The man of genius\\r\\nis one of millions, and the great geniuses, the crown of humanity,\\r\\nappear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions. In fact I have\\r\\nnot peeped into the retort in which all this takes place. But there\\r\\ncertainly is and must be a definite law, it cannot be a matter of\\r\\nchance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, are you both joking?” Razumihin cried at last. “There you sit,\\r\\nmaking fun of one another. Are you serious, Rodya?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply.\\r\\nAnd the unconcealed, persistent, nervous, and _discourteous_ sarcasm of\\r\\nPorfiry seemed strange to Razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, brother, if you are really serious... You are right, of course,\\r\\nin saying that it’s not new, that it’s like what we’ve read and heard a\\r\\nthousand times already; but what is really original in all this, and is\\r\\nexclusively your own, to my horror, is that you sanction bloodshed\\r\\n_in the name of conscience_, and, excuse my saying so, with such\\r\\nfanaticism.... That, I take it, is the point of your article. But that\\r\\nsanction of bloodshed _by conscience_ is to my mind... more terrible\\r\\nthan the official, legal sanction of bloodshed....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are quite right, it is more terrible,” Porfiry agreed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, you must have exaggerated! There is some mistake, I shall read it.\\r\\nYou can’t think that! I shall read it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All that is not in the article, there’s only a hint of it,” said\\r\\nRaskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes.” Porfiry couldn’t sit still. “Your attitude to crime is\\r\\npretty clear to me now, but... excuse me for my impertinence (I am\\r\\nreally ashamed to be worrying you like this), you see, you’ve removed\\r\\nmy anxiety as to the two grades getting mixed, but... there are various\\r\\npractical possibilities that make me uneasy! What if some man or youth\\r\\nimagines that he is a Lycurgus or Mahomet--a future one of course--and\\r\\nsuppose he begins to remove all obstacles.... He has some great\\r\\nenterprise before him and needs money for it... and tries to get it...\\r\\ndo you see?”\\r\\n\\r\\nZametov gave a sudden guffaw in his corner. Raskolnikov did not even\\r\\nraise his eyes to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must admit,” he went on calmly, “that such cases certainly must\\r\\narise. The vain and foolish are particularly apt to fall into that\\r\\nsnare; young people especially.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, you see. Well then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What then?” Raskolnikov smiled in reply; “that’s not my fault. So it is\\r\\nand so it always will be. He said just now (he nodded at Razumihin)\\r\\nthat I sanction bloodshed. Society is too well protected by prisons,\\r\\nbanishment, criminal investigators, penal servitude. There’s no need to\\r\\nbe uneasy. You have but to catch the thief.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what if we do catch him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then he gets what he deserves.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are certainly logical. But what of his conscience?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why do you care about that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Simply from humanity.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake. That will be his\\r\\npunishment--as well as the prison.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the real geniuses,” asked Razumihin frowning, “those who have\\r\\nthe right to murder? Oughtn’t they to suffer at all even for the blood\\r\\nthey’ve shed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why the word _ought_? It’s not a matter of permission or prohibition.\\r\\nHe will suffer if he is sorry for his victim. Pain and suffering are\\r\\nalways inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The\\r\\nreally great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth,” he added\\r\\ndreamily, not in the tone of the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe raised his eyes, looked earnestly at them all, smiled, and took his\\r\\ncap. He was too quiet by comparison with his manner at his entrance, and\\r\\nhe felt this. Everyone got up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you may abuse me, be angry with me if you like,” Porfiry\\r\\nPetrovitch began again, “but I can’t resist. Allow me one little\\r\\nquestion (I know I am troubling you). There is just one little notion I\\r\\nwant to express, simply that I may not forget it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good, tell me your little notion,” Raskolnikov stood waiting, pale\\r\\nand grave before him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you see... I really don’t know how to express it properly....\\r\\nIt’s a playful, psychological idea.... When you were writing your\\r\\narticle, surely you couldn’t have helped, he-he! fancying yourself...\\r\\njust a little, an ‘extraordinary’ man, uttering a _new word_ in your\\r\\nsense.... That’s so, isn’t it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite possibly,” Raskolnikov answered contemptuously.\\r\\n\\r\\nRazumihin made a movement.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And, if so, could you bring yourself in case of worldly difficulties\\r\\nand hardship or for some service to humanity--to overstep obstacles?...\\r\\nFor instance, to rob and murder?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd again he winked with his left eye, and laughed noiselessly just as\\r\\nbefore.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If I did I certainly should not tell you,” Raskolnikov answered with\\r\\ndefiant and haughty contempt.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I was only interested on account of your article, from a literary\\r\\npoint of view...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Foo! how obvious and insolent that is!” Raskolnikov thought with\\r\\nrepulsion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Allow me to observe,” he answered dryly, “that I don’t consider myself\\r\\na Mahomet or a Napoleon, nor any personage of that kind, and not being\\r\\none of them I cannot tell you how I should act.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, come, don’t we all think ourselves Napoleons now in Russia?”\\r\\n Porfiry Petrovitch said with alarming familiarity.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation of his voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps it was one of these future Napoleons who did for Alyona\\r\\nIvanovna last week?” Zametov blurted out from the corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov did not speak, but looked firmly and intently at Porfiry.\\r\\nRazumihin was scowling gloomily. He seemed before this to be noticing\\r\\nsomething. He looked angrily around. There was a minute of gloomy\\r\\nsilence. Raskolnikov turned to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you going already?” Porfiry said amiably, holding out his hand with\\r\\nexcessive politeness. “Very, very glad of your acquaintance. As for your\\r\\nrequest, have no uneasiness, write just as I told you, or, better still,\\r\\ncome to me there yourself in a day or two... to-morrow, indeed. I shall\\r\\nbe there at eleven o’clock for certain. We’ll arrange it all; we’ll have\\r\\na talk. As one of the last to be _there_, you might perhaps be able to\\r\\ntell us something,” he added with a most good-natured expression.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You want to cross-examine me officially in due form?” Raskolnikov asked\\r\\nsharply.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, why? That’s not necessary for the present. You misunderstand me.\\r\\nI lose no opportunity, you see, and... I’ve talked with all who had\\r\\npledges.... I obtained evidence from some of them, and you are the\\r\\nlast.... Yes, by the way,” he cried, seemingly suddenly delighted, “I\\r\\njust remember, what was I thinking of?” he turned to Razumihin, “you\\r\\nwere talking my ears off about that Nikolay... of course, I know, I know\\r\\nvery well,” he turned to Raskolnikov, “that the fellow is innocent, but\\r\\nwhat is one to do? We had to trouble Dmitri too.... This is the point,\\r\\nthis is all: when you went up the stairs it was past seven, wasn’t it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” answered Raskolnikov, with an unpleasant sensation at the very\\r\\nmoment he spoke that he need not have said it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then when you went upstairs between seven and eight, didn’t you see in\\r\\na flat that stood open on a second storey, do you remember? two workmen\\r\\nor at least one of them? They were painting there, didn’t you notice\\r\\nthem? It’s very, very important for them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Painters? No, I didn’t see them,” Raskolnikov answered slowly, as\\r\\nthough ransacking his memory, while at the same instant he was racking\\r\\nevery nerve, almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as\\r\\npossible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything. “No, I didn’t\\r\\nsee them, and I don’t think I noticed a flat like that open.... But on\\r\\nthe fourth storey” (he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant)\\r\\n“I remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite Alyona\\r\\nIvanovna’s.... I remember... I remember it clearly. Some porters\\r\\nwere carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall. But\\r\\npainters... no, I don’t remember that there were any painters, and I\\r\\ndon’t think that there was a flat open anywhere, no, there wasn’t.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean?” Razumihin shouted suddenly, as though he had\\r\\nreflected and realised. “Why, it was on the day of the murder the\\r\\npainters were at work, and he was there three days before? What are you\\r\\nasking?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Foo! I have muddled it!” Porfiry slapped himself on the forehead.\\r\\n“Deuce take it! This business is turning my brain!” he addressed\\r\\nRaskolnikov somewhat apologetically. “It would be such a great thing for\\r\\nus to find out whether anyone had seen them between seven and eight at\\r\\nthe flat, so I fancied you could perhaps have told us something.... I\\r\\nquite muddled it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you should be more careful,” Razumihin observed grimly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last words were uttered in the passage. Porfiry Petrovitch saw them\\r\\nto the door with excessive politeness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went out into the street gloomy and sullen, and for some steps they\\r\\ndid not say a word. Raskolnikov drew a deep breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t believe it, I can’t believe it!” repeated Razumihin, trying in\\r\\nperplexity to refute Raskolnikov’s arguments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were by now approaching Bakaleyev’s lodgings, where Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna and Dounia had been expecting them a long while. Razumihin\\r\\nkept stopping on the way in the heat of discussion, confused and excited\\r\\nby the very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly about\\r\\n_it_.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t believe it, then!” answered Raskolnikov, with a cold, careless\\r\\nsmile. “You were noticing nothing as usual, but I was weighing every\\r\\nword.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are suspicious. That is why you weighed their words... h’m...\\r\\ncertainly, I agree, Porfiry’s tone was rather strange, and still\\r\\nmore that wretch Zametov!... You are right, there was something about\\r\\nhim--but why? Why?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has changed his mind since last night.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite the contrary! If they had that brainless idea, they would do\\r\\ntheir utmost to hide it, and conceal their cards, so as to catch you\\r\\nafterwards.... But it was all impudent and careless.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If they had had facts--I mean, real facts--or at least grounds for\\r\\nsuspicion, then they would certainly have tried to hide their game,\\r\\nin the hope of getting more (they would have made a search long ago\\r\\nbesides). But they have no facts, not one. It is all mirage--all\\r\\nambiguous. Simply a floating idea. So they try to throw me out by\\r\\nimpudence. And perhaps, he was irritated at having no facts, and blurted\\r\\nit out in his vexation--or perhaps he has some plan... he seems an\\r\\nintelligent man. Perhaps he wanted to frighten me by pretending to\\r\\nknow. They have a psychology of their own, brother. But it is loathsome\\r\\nexplaining it all. Stop!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And it’s insulting, insulting! I understand you. But... since we have\\r\\nspoken openly now (and it is an excellent thing that we have at last--I\\r\\nam glad) I will own now frankly that I noticed it in them long ago,\\r\\nthis idea. Of course the merest hint only--an insinuation--but why an\\r\\ninsinuation even? How dare they? What foundation have they? If only you\\r\\nknew how furious I have been. Think only! Simply because a poor student,\\r\\nunhinged by poverty and hypochondria, on the eve of a severe delirious\\r\\nillness (note that), suspicious, vain, proud, who has not seen a soul to\\r\\nspeak to for six months, in rags and in boots without soles, has to\\r\\nface some wretched policemen and put up with their insolence; and\\r\\nthe unexpected debt thrust under his nose, the I.O.U. presented\\r\\nby Tchebarov, the new paint, thirty degrees Reaumur and a stifling\\r\\natmosphere, a crowd of people, the talk about the murder of a person\\r\\nwhere he had been just before, and all that on an empty stomach--he\\r\\nmight well have a fainting fit! And that, that is what they found it\\r\\nall on! Damn them! I understand how annoying it is, but in your place,\\r\\nRodya, I would laugh at them, or better still, spit in their ugly faces,\\r\\nand spit a dozen times in all directions. I’d hit out in all\\r\\ndirections, neatly too, and so I’d put an end to it. Damn them! Don’t be\\r\\ndownhearted. It’s a shame!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He really has put it well, though,” Raskolnikov thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Damn them? But the cross-examination again, to-morrow?” he said with\\r\\nbitterness. “Must I really enter into explanations with them? I feel\\r\\nvexed as it is, that I condescended to speak to Zametov yesterday in the\\r\\nrestaurant....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Damn it! I will go myself to Porfiry. I will squeeze it out of him, as\\r\\none of the family: he must let me know the ins and outs of it all! And\\r\\nas for Zametov...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“At last he sees through him!” thought Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stay!” cried Razumihin, seizing him by the shoulder again. “Stay! you\\r\\nwere wrong. I have thought it out. You are wrong! How was that a trap?\\r\\nYou say that the question about the workmen was a trap. But if you had\\r\\ndone _that_, could you have said you had seen them painting the flat...\\r\\nand the workmen? On the contrary, you would have seen nothing, even if\\r\\nyou had seen it. Who would own it against himself?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If I had done _that thing_, I should certainly have said that I had\\r\\nseen the workmen and the flat,” Raskolnikov answered, with reluctance\\r\\nand obvious disgust.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But why speak against yourself?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because only peasants, or the most inexperienced novices deny\\r\\neverything flatly at examinations. If a man is ever so little developed\\r\\nand experienced, he will certainly try to admit all the external facts\\r\\nthat can’t be avoided, but will seek other explanations of them, will\\r\\nintroduce some special, unexpected turn, that will give them another\\r\\nsignificance and put them in another light. Porfiry might well reckon\\r\\nthat I should be sure to answer so, and say I had seen them to give an\\r\\nair of truth, and then make some explanation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But he would have told you at once that the workmen could not have been\\r\\nthere two days before, and that therefore you must have been there on\\r\\nthe day of the murder at eight o’clock. And so he would have caught you\\r\\nover a detail.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, that is what he was reckoning on, that I should not have time to\\r\\nreflect, and should be in a hurry to make the most likely answer, and\\r\\nso would forget that the workmen could not have been there two days\\r\\nbefore.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But how could you forget it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing easier. It is in just such stupid things clever people are most\\r\\neasily caught. The more cunning a man is, the less he suspects that he\\r\\nwill be caught in a simple thing. The more cunning a man is, the simpler\\r\\nthe trap he must be caught in. Porfiry is not such a fool as you\\r\\nthink....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is a knave then, if that is so!”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov could not help laughing. But at the very moment, he was\\r\\nstruck by the strangeness of his own frankness, and the eagerness\\r\\nwith which he had made this explanation, though he had kept up all the\\r\\npreceding conversation with gloomy repulsion, obviously with a motive,\\r\\nfrom necessity.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am getting a relish for certain aspects!” he thought to himself.\\r\\nBut almost at the same instant he became suddenly uneasy, as though an\\r\\nunexpected and alarming idea had occurred to him. His uneasiness kept on\\r\\nincreasing. They had just reached the entrance to Bakaleyev’s.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go in alone!” said Raskolnikov suddenly. “I will be back directly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where are you going? Why, we are just here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t help it.... I will come in half an hour. Tell them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Say what you like, I will come with you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You, too, want to torture me!” he screamed, with such bitter\\r\\nirritation, such despair in his eyes that Razumihin’s hands dropped.\\r\\nHe stood for some time on the steps, looking gloomily at Raskolnikov\\r\\nstriding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging. At last, gritting\\r\\nhis teeth and clenching his fist, he swore he would squeeze Porfiry\\r\\nlike a lemon that very day, and went up the stairs to reassure Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna, who was by now alarmed at their long absence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Raskolnikov got home, his hair was soaked with sweat and he was\\r\\nbreathing heavily. He went rapidly up the stairs, walked into his\\r\\nunlocked room and at once fastened the latch. Then in senseless terror\\r\\nhe rushed to the corner, to that hole under the paper where he had put\\r\\nthe things; put his hand in, and for some minutes felt carefully in the\\r\\nhole, in every crack and fold of the paper. Finding nothing, he got up\\r\\nand drew a deep breath. As he was reaching the steps of Bakaleyev’s, he\\r\\nsuddenly fancied that something, a chain, a stud or even a bit of paper\\r\\nin which they had been wrapped with the old woman’s handwriting on it,\\r\\nmight somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack, and then\\r\\nmight suddenly turn up as unexpected, conclusive evidence against him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood as though lost in thought, and a strange, humiliated, half\\r\\nsenseless smile strayed on his lips. He took his cap at last and went\\r\\nquietly out of the room. His ideas were all tangled. He went dreamily\\r\\nthrough the gateway.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here he is himself,” shouted a loud voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe raised his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe porter was standing at the door of his little room and was pointing\\r\\nhim out to a short man who looked like an artisan, wearing a long coat\\r\\nand a waistcoat, and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman. He\\r\\nstooped, and his head in a greasy cap hung forward. From his wrinkled\\r\\nflabby face he looked over fifty; his little eyes were lost in fat and\\r\\nthey looked out grimly, sternly and discontentedly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?” Raskolnikov asked, going up to the porter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man stole a look at him from under his brows and he looked at him\\r\\nattentively, deliberately; then he turned slowly and went out of the\\r\\ngate into the street without saying a word.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?” cried Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, he there was asking whether a student lived here, mentioned your\\r\\nname and whom you lodged with. I saw you coming and pointed you out and\\r\\nhe went away. It’s funny.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe porter too seemed rather puzzled, but not much so, and after\\r\\nwondering for a moment he turned and went back to his room.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov ran after the stranger, and at once caught sight of\\r\\nhim walking along the other side of the street with the same even,\\r\\ndeliberate step with his eyes fixed on the ground, as though in\\r\\nmeditation. He soon overtook him, but for some time walked behind him.\\r\\nAt last, moving on to a level with him, he looked at his face. The man\\r\\nnoticed him at once, looked at him quickly, but dropped his eyes again;\\r\\nand so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You were inquiring for me... of the porter?” Raskolnikov said at last,\\r\\nbut in a curiously quiet voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man made no answer; he didn’t even look at him. Again they were both\\r\\nsilent.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why do you... come and ask for me... and say nothing.... What’s the\\r\\nmeaning of it?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov’s voice broke and he seemed unable to articulate the words\\r\\nclearly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man raised his eyes this time and turned a gloomy sinister look at\\r\\nRaskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Murderer!” he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov went on walking beside him. His legs felt suddenly weak, a\\r\\ncold shiver ran down his spine, and his heart seemed to stand still for\\r\\na moment, then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free. So\\r\\nthey walked for about a hundred paces, side by side in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man did not look at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean... what is.... Who is a murderer?” muttered\\r\\nRaskolnikov hardly audibly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“_You_ are a murderer,” the man answered still more articulately and\\r\\nemphatically, with a smile of triumphant hatred, and again he looked\\r\\nstraight into Raskolnikov’s pale face and stricken eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had just reached the cross-roads. The man turned to the left\\r\\nwithout looking behind him. Raskolnikov remained standing, gazing after\\r\\nhim. He saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still\\r\\nstanding there. Raskolnikov could not see clearly, but he fancied that\\r\\nhe was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith slow faltering steps, with shaking knees, Raskolnikov made his way\\r\\nback to his little garret, feeling chilled all over. He took off his cap\\r\\nand put it on the table, and for ten minutes he stood without moving.\\r\\nThen he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he\\r\\nstretched himself on it. So he lay for half an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought of nothing. Some thoughts or fragments of thoughts, some\\r\\nimages without order or coherence floated before his mind--faces of\\r\\npeople he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once, whom he would\\r\\nnever have recalled, the belfry of the church at V., the billiard table\\r\\nin a restaurant and some officers playing billiards, the smell of cigars\\r\\nin some underground tobacco shop, a tavern room, a back staircase quite\\r\\ndark, all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg-shells, and the\\r\\nSunday bells floating in from somewhere.... The images followed one\\r\\nanother, whirling like a hurricane. Some of them he liked and tried\\r\\nto clutch at, but they faded and all the while there was an oppression\\r\\nwithin him, but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it was even\\r\\npleasant.... The slight shivering still persisted, but that too\\r\\nwas an almost pleasant sensation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he closed his eyes and\\r\\npretended to be asleep. Razumihin opened the door and stood for some\\r\\ntime in the doorway as though hesitating, then he stepped softly into\\r\\nthe room and went cautiously to the sofa. Raskolnikov heard Nastasya’s\\r\\nwhisper:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t disturb him! Let him sleep. He can have his dinner later.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so,” answered Razumihin. Both withdrew carefully and closed the\\r\\ndoor. Another half-hour passed. Raskolnikov opened his eyes, turned on\\r\\nhis back again, clasping his hands behind his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who is he? Who is that man who sprang out of the earth? Where was he,\\r\\nwhat did he see? He has seen it all, that’s clear. Where was he then?\\r\\nAnd from where did he see? Why has he only now sprung out of the earth?\\r\\nAnd how could he see? Is it possible? Hm...” continued Raskolnikov,\\r\\nturning cold and shivering, “and the jewel case Nikolay found behind the\\r\\ndoor--was that possible? A clue? You miss an infinitesimal line and you\\r\\ncan build it into a pyramid of evidence! A fly flew by and saw it! Is it\\r\\npossible?” He felt with sudden loathing how weak, how physically weak he\\r\\nhad become. “I ought to have known it,” he thought with a bitter smile.\\r\\n“And how dared I, knowing myself, knowing how I should be, take up an\\r\\naxe and shed blood! I ought to have known beforehand.... Ah, but I did\\r\\nknow!” he whispered in despair. At times he came to a standstill at some\\r\\nthought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, those men are not made so. The real _Master_ to whom all is\\r\\npermitted storms Toulon, makes a massacre in Paris, _forgets_ an army in\\r\\nEgypt, _wastes_ half a million men in the Moscow expedition and gets off\\r\\nwith a jest at Vilna. And altars are set up to him after his death, and\\r\\nso _all_ is permitted. No, such people, it seems, are not of flesh but\\r\\nof bronze!”\\r\\n\\r\\nOne sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh. Napoleon, the\\r\\npyramids, Waterloo, and a wretched skinny old woman, a pawnbroker with\\r\\na red trunk under her bed--it’s a nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch to\\r\\ndigest! How can they digest it! It’s too inartistic. “A Napoleon creep\\r\\nunder an old woman’s bed! Ugh, how loathsome!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt moments he felt he was raving. He sank into a state of feverish\\r\\nexcitement. “The old woman is of no consequence,” he thought, hotly and\\r\\nincoherently. “The old woman was a mistake perhaps, but she is not\\r\\nwhat matters! The old woman was only an illness.... I was in a hurry to\\r\\noverstep.... I didn’t kill a human being, but a principle! I killed the\\r\\nprinciple, but I didn’t overstep, I stopped on this side.... I was\\r\\nonly capable of killing. And it seems I wasn’t even capable of that...\\r\\nPrinciple? Why was that fool Razumihin abusing the socialists? They are\\r\\nindustrious, commercial people; ‘the happiness of all’ is their case.\\r\\nNo, life is only given to me once and I shall never have it again; I\\r\\ndon’t want to wait for ‘the happiness of all.’ I want to live myself,\\r\\nor else better not live at all. I simply couldn’t pass by my mother\\r\\nstarving, keeping my rouble in my pocket while I waited for the\\r\\n‘happiness of all.’ I am putting my little brick into the happiness of\\r\\nall and so my heart is at peace. Ha-ha! Why have you let me slip? I only\\r\\nlive once, I too want.... Ech, I am an æsthetic louse and nothing\\r\\nmore,” he added suddenly, laughing like a madman. “Yes, I am certainly a\\r\\nlouse,” he went on, clutching at the idea, gloating over it and playing\\r\\nwith it with vindictive pleasure. “In the first place, because I can\\r\\nreason that I am one, and secondly, because for a month past I have been\\r\\ntroubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that not for\\r\\nmy own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a grand and noble\\r\\nobject--ha-ha! Thirdly, because I aimed at carrying it out as justly as\\r\\npossible, weighing, measuring and calculating. Of all the lice I picked\\r\\nout the most useless one and proposed to take from her only as much as I\\r\\nneeded for the first step, no more nor less (so the rest would have gone\\r\\nto a monastery, according to her will, ha-ha!). And what shows that I\\r\\nam utterly a louse,” he added, grinding his teeth, “is that I am\\r\\nperhaps viler and more loathsome than the louse I killed, and _I felt\\r\\nbeforehand_ that I should tell myself so _after_ killing her. Can\\r\\nanything be compared with the horror of that? The vulgarity! The\\r\\nabjectness! I understand the ‘prophet’ with his sabre, on his steed:\\r\\nAllah commands and ‘trembling’ creation must obey! The ‘prophet’ is\\r\\nright, he is right when he sets a battery across the street and blows up\\r\\nthe innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain! It’s for you to\\r\\nobey, trembling creation, and not _to have desires_, for that’s not for\\r\\nyou!... I shall never, never forgive the old woman!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis hair was soaked with sweat, his quivering lips were parched, his\\r\\neyes were fixed on the ceiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mother, sister--how I loved them! Why do I hate them now? Yes, I hate\\r\\nthem, I feel a physical hatred for them, I can’t bear them near me....\\r\\nI went up to my mother and kissed her, I remember.... To embrace her\\r\\nand think if she only knew... shall I tell her then? That’s just what\\r\\nI might do.... _She_ must be the same as I am,” he added, straining\\r\\nhimself to think, as it were struggling with delirium. “Ah, how I hate\\r\\nthe old woman now! I feel I should kill her again if she came to life!\\r\\nPoor Lizaveta! Why did she come in?... It’s strange though, why is it\\r\\nI scarcely ever think of her, as though I hadn’t killed her? Lizaveta!\\r\\nSonia! Poor gentle things, with gentle eyes.... Dear women! Why don’t\\r\\nthey weep? Why don’t they moan? They give up everything... their eyes\\r\\nare soft and gentle.... Sonia, Sonia! Gentle Sonia!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe lost consciousness; it seemed strange to him that he didn’t remember\\r\\nhow he got into the street. It was late evening. The twilight had fallen\\r\\nand the full moon was shining more and more brightly; but there was a\\r\\npeculiar breathlessness in the air. There were crowds of people in the\\r\\nstreet; workmen and business people were making their way home; other\\r\\npeople had come out for a walk; there was a smell of mortar, dust and\\r\\nstagnant water. Raskolnikov walked along, mournful and anxious; he was\\r\\ndistinctly aware of having come out with a purpose, of having to do\\r\\nsomething in a hurry, but what it was he had forgotten. Suddenly he\\r\\nstood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street,\\r\\nbeckoning to him. He crossed over to him, but at once the man turned and\\r\\nwalked away with his head hanging, as though he had made no sign to\\r\\nhim. “Stay, did he really beckon?” Raskolnikov wondered, but he tried\\r\\nto overtake him. When he was within ten paces he recognised him and\\r\\nwas frightened; it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the long\\r\\ncoat. Raskolnikov followed him at a distance; his heart was beating;\\r\\nthey went down a turning; the man still did not look round. “Does he\\r\\nknow I am following him?” thought Raskolnikov. The man went into the\\r\\ngateway of a big house. Raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in\\r\\nto see whether he would look round and sign to him. In the court-yard\\r\\nthe man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him. Raskolnikov at\\r\\nonce followed him into the yard, but the man was gone. He must have\\r\\ngone up the first staircase. Raskolnikov rushed after him. He heard\\r\\nslow measured steps two flights above. The staircase seemed strangely\\r\\nfamiliar. He reached the window on the first floor; the moon shone\\r\\nthrough the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light; then he\\r\\nreached the second floor. Bah! this is the flat where the painters were\\r\\nat work... but how was it he did not recognise it at once? The steps\\r\\nof the man above had died away. “So he must have stopped or hidden\\r\\nsomewhere.” He reached the third storey, should he go on? There was a\\r\\nstillness that was dreadful.... But he went on. The sound of his own\\r\\nfootsteps scared and frightened him. How dark it was! The man must be\\r\\nhiding in some corner here. Ah! the flat was standing wide open, he\\r\\nhesitated and went in. It was very dark and empty in the passage, as\\r\\nthough everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour\\r\\nwhich was flooded with moonlight. Everything there was as before, the\\r\\nchairs, the looking-glass, the yellow sofa and the pictures in the\\r\\nframes. A huge, round, copper-red moon looked in at the windows.\\r\\n“It’s the moon that makes it so still, weaving some mystery,” thought\\r\\nRaskolnikov. He stood and waited, waited a long while, and the more\\r\\nsilent the moonlight, the more violently his heart beat, till it was\\r\\npainful. And still the same hush. Suddenly he heard a momentary sharp\\r\\ncrack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again. A fly\\r\\nflew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz. At\\r\\nthat moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little\\r\\ncupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall. “Why is that cloak\\r\\nhere?” he thought, “it wasn’t there before....” He went up to it quietly\\r\\nand felt that there was someone hiding behind it. He cautiously moved\\r\\nthe cloak and saw, sitting on a chair in the corner, the old woman bent\\r\\ndouble so that he couldn’t see her face; but it was she. He stood over\\r\\nher. “She is afraid,” he thought. He stealthily took the axe from the\\r\\nnoose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull. But strange\\r\\nto say she did not stir, as though she were made of wood. He was\\r\\nfrightened, bent down nearer and tried to look at her; but she, too,\\r\\nbent her head lower. He bent right down to the ground and peeped up\\r\\ninto her face from below, he peeped and turned cold with horror: the old\\r\\nwoman was sitting and laughing, shaking with noiseless laughter, doing\\r\\nher utmost that he should not hear it. Suddenly he fancied that the door\\r\\nfrom the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter and\\r\\nwhispering within. He was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the\\r\\nold woman on the head with all his force, but at every blow of the axe\\r\\nthe laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old\\r\\nwoman was simply shaking with mirth. He was rushing away, but the\\r\\npassage was full of people, the doors of the flats stood open and on the\\r\\nlanding, on the stairs and everywhere below there were people, rows of\\r\\nheads, all looking, but huddled together in silence and expectation.\\r\\nSomething gripped his heart, his legs were rooted to the spot, they\\r\\nwould not move.... He tried to scream and woke up.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe drew a deep breath--but his dream seemed strangely to persist:\\r\\nhis door was flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in the\\r\\ndoorway watching him intently.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly closed them\\r\\nagain. He lay on his back without stirring.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it still a dream?” he wondered and again raised his eyelids hardly\\r\\nperceptibly; the stranger was standing in the same place, still watching\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stepped cautiously into the room, carefully closing the door after\\r\\nhim, went up to the table, paused a moment, still keeping his eyes on\\r\\nRaskolnikov, and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa; he\\r\\nput his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his hands on his cane\\r\\nand his chin on his hands. It was evident that he was prepared to wait\\r\\nindefinitely. As far as Raskolnikov could make out from his stolen\\r\\nglances, he was a man no longer young, stout, with a full, fair, almost\\r\\nwhitish beard.\\r\\n\\r\\nTen minutes passed. It was still light, but beginning to get dusk. There\\r\\nwas complete stillness in the room. Not a sound came from the stairs.\\r\\nOnly a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane. It was\\r\\nunbearable at last. Raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, tell me what you want.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I knew you were not asleep, but only pretending,” the stranger answered\\r\\noddly, laughing calmly. “Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov, allow me to\\r\\nintroduce myself....”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART IV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can this be still a dream?” Raskolnikov thought once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected visitor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Svidrigaïlov! What nonsense! It can’t be!” he said at last aloud in\\r\\nbewilderment.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis visitor did not seem at all surprised at this exclamation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve come to you for two reasons. In the first place, I wanted to make\\r\\nyour personal acquaintance, as I have already heard a great deal about\\r\\nyou that is interesting and flattering; secondly, I cherish the hope\\r\\nthat you may not refuse to assist me in a matter directly concerning the\\r\\nwelfare of your sister, Avdotya Romanovna. For without your support she\\r\\nmight not let me come near her now, for she is prejudiced against me,\\r\\nbut with your assistance I reckon on...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You reckon wrongly,” interrupted Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They only arrived yesterday, may I ask you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov made no reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was yesterday, I know. I only arrived myself the day before. Well,\\r\\nlet me tell you this, Rodion Romanovitch, I don’t consider it necessary\\r\\nto justify myself, but kindly tell me what was there particularly\\r\\ncriminal on my part in all this business, speaking without prejudice,\\r\\nwith common sense?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov continued to look at him in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That in my own house I persecuted a defenceless girl and ‘insulted her\\r\\nwith my infamous proposals’--is that it? (I am anticipating you.) But\\r\\nyou’ve only to assume that I, too, am a man _et nihil humanum_... in a\\r\\nword, that I am capable of being attracted and falling in love (which\\r\\ndoes not depend on our will), then everything can be explained in the\\r\\nmost natural manner. The question is, am I a monster, or am I myself\\r\\na victim? And what if I am a victim? In proposing to the object of my\\r\\npassion to elope with me to America or Switzerland, I may have cherished\\r\\nthe deepest respect for her and may have thought that I was promoting\\r\\nour mutual happiness! Reason is the slave of passion, you know; why,\\r\\nprobably, I was doing more harm to myself than anyone!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But that’s not the point,” Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust. “It’s\\r\\nsimply that whether you are right or wrong, we dislike you. We don’t\\r\\nwant to have anything to do with you. We show you the door. Go out!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you’re... but there’s no getting round you,” he said, laughing in\\r\\nthe frankest way. “I hoped to get round you, but you took up the right\\r\\nline at once!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you are trying to get round me still!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What of it? What of it?” cried Svidrigaïlov, laughing openly. “But this\\r\\nis what the French call _bonne guerre_, and the most innocent form of\\r\\ndeception!... But still you have interrupted me; one way or another, I\\r\\nrepeat again: there would never have been any unpleasantness except for\\r\\nwhat happened in the garden. Marfa Petrovna...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have got rid of Marfa Petrovna, too, so they say?” Raskolnikov\\r\\ninterrupted rudely.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you’ve heard that, too, then? You’d be sure to, though.... But\\r\\nas for your question, I really don’t know what to say, though my own\\r\\nconscience is quite at rest on that score. Don’t suppose that I am in\\r\\nany apprehension about it. All was regular and in order; the medical\\r\\ninquiry diagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy\\r\\ndinner and a bottle of wine, and indeed it could have proved nothing\\r\\nelse. But I’ll tell you what I have been thinking to myself of late, on\\r\\nmy way here in the train, especially: didn’t I contribute to all that...\\r\\ncalamity, morally, in a way, by irritation or something of the\\r\\nsort. But I came to the conclusion that that, too, was quite out of the\\r\\nquestion.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wonder you trouble yourself about it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what are you laughing at? Only consider, I struck her just twice\\r\\nwith a switch--there were no marks even... don’t regard me as a cynic,\\r\\nplease; I am perfectly aware how atrocious it was of me and all that;\\r\\nbut I know for certain, too, that Marfa Petrovna was very likely pleased\\r\\nat my, so to say, warmth. The story of your sister had been wrung out to\\r\\nthe last drop; for the last three days Marfa Petrovna had been forced to\\r\\nsit at home; she had nothing to show herself with in the town. Besides,\\r\\nshe had bored them so with that letter (you heard about her reading the\\r\\nletter). And all of a sudden those two switches fell from heaven! Her\\r\\nfirst act was to order the carriage to be got out.... Not to speak\\r\\nof the fact that there are cases when women are very, very glad to be\\r\\ninsulted in spite of all their show of indignation. There are instances\\r\\nof it with everyone; human beings in general, indeed, greatly love to\\r\\nbe insulted, have you noticed that? But it’s particularly so with women.\\r\\nOne might even say it’s their only amusement.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one time Raskolnikov thought of getting up and walking out and so\\r\\nfinishing the interview. But some curiosity and even a sort of prudence\\r\\nmade him linger for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are fond of fighting?” he asked carelessly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, not very,” Svidrigaïlov answered, calmly. “And Marfa Petrovna and\\r\\nI scarcely ever fought. We lived very harmoniously, and she was always\\r\\npleased with me. I only used the whip twice in all our seven years (not\\r\\ncounting a third occasion of a very ambiguous character). The first\\r\\ntime, two months after our marriage, immediately after we arrived in the\\r\\ncountry, and the last time was that of which we are speaking. Did you\\r\\nsuppose I was such a monster, such a reactionary, such a slave driver?\\r\\nHa, ha! By the way, do you remember, Rodion Romanovitch, how a few years\\r\\nago, in those days of beneficent publicity, a nobleman, I’ve forgotten\\r\\nhis name, was put to shame everywhere, in all the papers, for having\\r\\nthrashed a German woman in the railway train. You remember? It was in\\r\\nthose days, that very year I believe, the ‘disgraceful action of the\\r\\n_Age_’ took place (you know, ‘The Egyptian Nights,’ that public reading,\\r\\nyou remember? The dark eyes, you know! Ah, the golden days of our youth,\\r\\nwhere are they?). Well, as for the gentleman who thrashed the German,\\r\\nI feel no sympathy with him, because after all what need is there\\r\\nfor sympathy? But I must say that there are sometimes such provoking\\r\\n‘Germans’ that I don’t believe there is a progressive who could quite\\r\\nanswer for himself. No one looked at the subject from that point of view\\r\\nthen, but that’s the truly humane point of view, I assure you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter saying this, Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh again.\\r\\nRaskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a firm purpose in his\\r\\nmind and able to keep it to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I expect you’ve not talked to anyone for some days?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Scarcely anyone. I suppose you are wondering at my being such an\\r\\nadaptable man?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I am only wondering at your being too adaptable a man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because I am not offended at the rudeness of your questions? Is that\\r\\nit? But why take offence? As you asked, so I answered,” he replied,\\r\\nwith a surprising expression of simplicity. “You know, there’s\\r\\nhardly anything I take interest in,” he went on, as it were dreamily,\\r\\n“especially now, I’ve nothing to do.... You are quite at liberty to\\r\\nimagine though that I am making up to you with a motive, particularly as\\r\\nI told you I want to see your sister about something. But I’ll confess\\r\\nfrankly, I am very much bored. The last three days especially, so I am\\r\\ndelighted to see you.... Don’t be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, but you\\r\\nseem to be somehow awfully strange yourself. Say what you like, there’s\\r\\nsomething wrong with you, and now, too... not this very minute, I mean,\\r\\nbut now, generally.... Well, well, I won’t, I won’t, don’t scowl! I am\\r\\nnot such a bear, you know, as you think.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov looked gloomily at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are not a bear, perhaps, at all,” he said. “I fancy indeed that\\r\\nyou are a man of very good breeding, or at least know how on occasion to\\r\\nbehave like one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am not particularly interested in anyone’s opinion,” Svidrigaïlov\\r\\nanswered, dryly and even with a shade of haughtiness, “and therefore why\\r\\nnot be vulgar at times when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for our\\r\\nclimate... and especially if one has a natural propensity that way,” he\\r\\nadded, laughing again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I’ve heard you have many friends here. You are, as they say, ‘not\\r\\nwithout connections.’ What can you want with me, then, unless you’ve\\r\\nsome special object?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s true that I have friends here,” Svidrigaïlov admitted, not\\r\\nreplying to the chief point. “I’ve met some already. I’ve been lounging\\r\\nabout for the last three days, and I’ve seen them, or they’ve seen me.\\r\\nThat’s a matter of course. I am well dressed and reckoned not a poor\\r\\nman; the emancipation of the serfs hasn’t affected me; my property\\r\\nconsists chiefly of forests and water meadows. The revenue has not\\r\\nfallen off; but... I am not going to see them, I was sick of them long\\r\\nago. I’ve been here three days and have called on no one.... What a town\\r\\nit is! How has it come into existence among us, tell me that? A town of\\r\\nofficials and students of all sorts. Yes, there’s a great deal I didn’t\\r\\nnotice when I was here eight years ago, kicking up my heels.... My only\\r\\nhope now is in anatomy, by Jove, it is!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anatomy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But as for these clubs, Dussauts, parades, or progress, indeed,\\r\\nmaybe--well, all that can go on without me,” he went on, again without\\r\\nnoticing the question. “Besides, who wants to be a card-sharper?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, have you been a card-sharper then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How could I help being? There was a regular set of us, men of the best\\r\\nsociety, eight years ago; we had a fine time. And all men of breeding,\\r\\nyou know, poets, men of property. And indeed as a rule in our Russian\\r\\nsociety the best manners are found among those who’ve been thrashed,\\r\\nhave you noticed that? I’ve deteriorated in the country. But I did get\\r\\ninto prison for debt, through a low Greek who came from Nezhin. Then\\r\\nMarfa Petrovna turned up; she bargained with him and bought me off for\\r\\nthirty thousand silver pieces (I owed seventy thousand). We were united\\r\\nin lawful wedlock and she bore me off into the country like a treasure.\\r\\nYou know she was five years older than I. She was very fond of me. For\\r\\nseven years I never left the country. And, take note, that all my life\\r\\nshe held a document over me, the IOU for thirty thousand roubles, so\\r\\nif I were to elect to be restive about anything I should be trapped at\\r\\nonce! And she would have done it! Women find nothing incompatible in\\r\\nthat.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If it hadn’t been for that, would you have given her the slip?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know what to say. It was scarcely the document restrained me. I\\r\\ndidn’t want to go anywhere else. Marfa Petrovna herself invited me to go\\r\\nabroad, seeing I was bored, but I’ve been abroad before, and always\\r\\nfelt sick there. For no reason, but the sunrise, the bay of Naples, the\\r\\nsea--you look at them and it makes you sad. What’s most revolting is\\r\\nthat one is really sad! No, it’s better at home. Here at least one\\r\\nblames others for everything and excuses oneself. I should have gone\\r\\nperhaps on an expedition to the North Pole, because _j’ai le vin\\r\\nmauvais_ and hate drinking, and there’s nothing left but wine. I have\\r\\ntried it. But, I say, I’ve been told Berg is going up in a great balloon\\r\\nnext Sunday from the Yusupov Garden and will take up passengers at a\\r\\nfee. Is it true?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, would you go up?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I... No, oh, no,” muttered Svidrigaïlov really seeming to be deep in\\r\\nthought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What does he mean? Is he in earnest?” Raskolnikov wondered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, the document didn’t restrain me,” Svidrigaïlov went on,\\r\\nmeditatively. “It was my own doing, not leaving the country, and nearly\\r\\na year ago Marfa Petrovna gave me back the document on my name-day\\r\\nand made me a present of a considerable sum of money, too. She had a\\r\\nfortune, you know. ‘You see how I trust you, Arkady Ivanovitch’--that\\r\\nwas actually her expression. You don’t believe she used it? But do\\r\\nyou know I managed the estate quite decently, they know me in the\\r\\nneighbourhood. I ordered books, too. Marfa Petrovna at first approved,\\r\\nbut afterwards she was afraid of my over-studying.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You seem to be missing Marfa Petrovna very much?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Missing her? Perhaps. Really, perhaps I am. And, by the way, do you\\r\\nbelieve in ghosts?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What ghosts?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, ordinary ghosts.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you believe in them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps not, _pour vous plaire_.... I wouldn’t say no exactly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you see them, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov looked at him rather oddly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Marfa Petrovna is pleased to visit me,” he said, twisting his mouth\\r\\ninto a strange smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you mean ‘she is pleased to visit you’?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She has been three times. I saw her first on the very day of the\\r\\nfuneral, an hour after she was buried. It was the day before I left to\\r\\ncome here. The second time was the day before yesterday, at daybreak, on\\r\\nthe journey at the station of Malaya Vishera, and the third time was two\\r\\nhours ago in the room where I am staying. I was alone.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Were you awake?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite awake. I was wide awake every time. She comes, speaks to me for\\r\\na minute and goes out at the door--always at the door. I can almost hear\\r\\nher.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What made me think that something of the sort must be happening to\\r\\nyou?” Raskolnikov said suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same moment he was surprised at having said it. He was much\\r\\nexcited.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What! Did you think so?” Svidrigaïlov asked in astonishment. “Did you\\r\\nreally? Didn’t I say that there was something in common between us, eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You never said so!” Raskolnikov cried sharply and with heat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Didn’t I?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought I did. When I came in and saw you lying with your eyes shut,\\r\\npretending, I said to myself at once, ‘Here’s the man.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean by ‘the man?’ What are you talking about?” cried\\r\\nRaskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do I mean? I really don’t know....” Svidrigaïlov muttered\\r\\ningenuously, as though he, too, were puzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a minute they were silent. They stared in each other’s faces.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s all nonsense!” Raskolnikov shouted with vexation. “What does she\\r\\nsay when she comes to you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She! Would you believe it, she talks of the silliest trifles and--man\\r\\nis a strange creature--it makes me angry. The first time she came in (I\\r\\nwas tired you know: the funeral service, the funeral ceremony, the lunch\\r\\nafterwards. At last I was left alone in my study. I lighted a cigar and\\r\\nbegan to think), she came in at the door. ‘You’ve been so busy to-day,\\r\\nArkady Ivanovitch, you have forgotten to wind the dining-room clock,’\\r\\nshe said. All those seven years I’ve wound that clock every week, and if\\r\\nI forgot it she would always remind me. The next day I set off on my way\\r\\nhere. I got out at the station at daybreak; I’d been asleep, tired out,\\r\\nwith my eyes half open, I was drinking some coffee. I looked up and\\r\\nthere was suddenly Marfa Petrovna sitting beside me with a pack of\\r\\ncards in her hands. ‘Shall I tell your fortune for the journey, Arkady\\r\\nIvanovitch?’ She was a great hand at telling fortunes. I shall never\\r\\nforgive myself for not asking her to. I ran away in a fright, and,\\r\\nbesides, the bell rang. I was sitting to-day, feeling very heavy after a\\r\\nmiserable dinner from a cookshop; I was sitting smoking, all of a sudden\\r\\nMarfa Petrovna again. She came in very smart in a new green silk dress\\r\\nwith a long train. ‘Good day, Arkady Ivanovitch! How do you like my\\r\\ndress? Aniska can’t make like this.’ (Aniska was a dressmaker in the\\r\\ncountry, one of our former serf girls who had been trained in Moscow, a\\r\\npretty wench.) She stood turning round before me. I looked at the dress,\\r\\nand then I looked carefully, very carefully, at her face. ‘I wonder\\r\\nyou trouble to come to me about such trifles, Marfa Petrovna.’ ‘Good\\r\\ngracious, you won’t let one disturb you about anything!’ To tease her\\r\\nI said, ‘I want to get married, Marfa Petrovna.’ ‘That’s just like you,\\r\\nArkady Ivanovitch; it does you very little credit to come looking for a\\r\\nbride when you’ve hardly buried your wife. And if you could make a good\\r\\nchoice, at least, but I know it won’t be for your happiness or hers, you\\r\\nwill only be a laughing-stock to all good people.’ Then she went out and\\r\\nher train seemed to rustle. Isn’t it nonsense, eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But perhaps you are telling lies?” Raskolnikov put in.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I rarely lie,” answered Svidrigaïlov thoughtfully, apparently not\\r\\nnoticing the rudeness of the question.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And in the past, have you ever seen ghosts before?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Y-yes, I have seen them, but only once in my life, six years ago. I had\\r\\na serf, Filka; just after his burial I called out forgetting ‘Filka, my\\r\\npipe!’ He came in and went to the cupboard where my pipes were. I sat\\r\\nstill and thought ‘he is doing it out of revenge,’ because we had a\\r\\nviolent quarrel just before his death. ‘How dare you come in with a hole\\r\\nin your elbow?’ I said. ‘Go away, you scamp!’ He turned and went out,\\r\\nand never came again. I didn’t tell Marfa Petrovna at the time. I wanted\\r\\nto have a service sung for him, but I was ashamed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You should go to a doctor.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know I am not well, without your telling me, though I don’t know\\r\\nwhat’s wrong; I believe I am five times as strong as you are. I didn’t\\r\\nask you whether you believe that ghosts are seen, but whether you\\r\\nbelieve that they exist.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I won’t believe it!” Raskolnikov cried, with positive anger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do people generally say?” muttered Svidrigaïlov, as though\\r\\nspeaking to himself, looking aside and bowing his head. “They say, ‘You\\r\\nare ill, so what appears to you is only unreal fantasy.’ But that’s not\\r\\nstrictly logical. I agree that ghosts only appear to the sick, but that\\r\\nonly proves that they are unable to appear except to the sick, not that\\r\\nthey don’t exist.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing of the sort,” Raskolnikov insisted irritably.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No? You don’t think so?” Svidrigaïlov went on, looking at him\\r\\ndeliberately. “But what do you say to this argument (help me with\\r\\nit): ghosts are, as it were, shreds and fragments of other worlds, the\\r\\nbeginning of them. A man in health has, of course, no reason to see\\r\\nthem, because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound for the\\r\\nsake of completeness and order to live only in this life. But as soon\\r\\nas one is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is\\r\\nbroken, one begins to realise the possibility of another world; and the\\r\\nmore seriously ill one is, the closer becomes one’s contact with that\\r\\nother world, so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into that\\r\\nworld. I thought of that long ago. If you believe in a future life, you\\r\\ncould believe in that, too.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t believe in a future life,” said Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov sat lost in thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what if there are only spiders there, or something of that sort,”\\r\\n he said suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is a madman,” thought Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception,\\r\\nsomething vast, vast! But why must it be vast? Instead of all that, what\\r\\nif it’s one little room, like a bath house in the country, black\\r\\nand grimy and spiders in every corner, and that’s all eternity is? I\\r\\nsometimes fancy it like that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than\\r\\nthat?” Raskolnikov cried, with a feeling of anguish.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Juster? And how can we tell, perhaps that is just, and do you know\\r\\nit’s what I would certainly have made it,” answered Svidrigaïlov, with a\\r\\nvague smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis horrible answer sent a cold chill through Raskolnikov. Svidrigaïlov\\r\\nraised his head, looked at him, and suddenly began laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only think,” he cried, “half an hour ago we had never seen each other,\\r\\nwe regarded each other as enemies; there is a matter unsettled between\\r\\nus; we’ve thrown it aside, and away we’ve gone into the abstract! Wasn’t\\r\\nI right in saying that we were birds of a feather?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kindly allow me,” Raskolnikov went on irritably, “to ask you to explain\\r\\nwhy you have honoured me with your visit... and... and I am in a hurry,\\r\\nI have no time to waste. I want to go out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By all means, by all means. Your sister, Avdotya Romanovna, is going to\\r\\nbe married to Mr. Luzhin, Pyotr Petrovitch?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning\\r\\nher name? I can’t understand how you dare utter her name in my presence,\\r\\nif you really are Svidrigaïlov.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, but I’ve come here to speak about her; how can I avoid mentioning\\r\\nher?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good, speak, but make haste.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sure that you must have formed your own opinion of this Mr.\\r\\nLuzhin, who is a connection of mine through my wife, if you have only\\r\\nseen him for half an hour, or heard any facts about him. He is no\\r\\nmatch for Avdotya Romanovna. I believe Avdotya Romanovna is sacrificing\\r\\nherself generously and imprudently for the sake of... for the sake of\\r\\nher family. I fancied from all I had heard of you that you would be very\\r\\nglad if the match could be broken off without the sacrifice of worldly\\r\\nadvantages. Now I know you personally, I am convinced of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All this is very naïve... excuse me, I should have said impudent on\\r\\nyour part,” said Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You mean to say that I am seeking my own ends. Don’t be uneasy, Rodion\\r\\nRomanovitch, if I were working for my own advantage, I would not have\\r\\nspoken out so directly. I am not quite a fool. I will confess something\\r\\npsychologically curious about that: just now, defending my love for\\r\\nAvdotya Romanovna, I said I was myself the victim. Well, let me tell you\\r\\nthat I’ve no feeling of love now, not the slightest, so that I wonder\\r\\nmyself indeed, for I really did feel something...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Through idleness and depravity,” Raskolnikov put in.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I certainly am idle and depraved, but your sister has such qualities\\r\\nthat even I could not help being impressed by them. But that’s all\\r\\nnonsense, as I see myself now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you seen that long?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I began to be aware of it before, but was only perfectly sure of it the\\r\\nday before yesterday, almost at the moment I arrived in Petersburg. I\\r\\nstill fancied in Moscow, though, that I was coming to try to get Avdotya\\r\\nRomanovna’s hand and to cut out Mr. Luzhin.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me for interrupting you; kindly be brief, and come to the object\\r\\nof your visit. I am in a hurry, I want to go out...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“With the greatest pleasure. On arriving here and determining on a\\r\\ncertain... journey, I should like to make some necessary preliminary\\r\\narrangements. I left my children with an aunt; they are well provided\\r\\nfor; and they have no need of me personally. And a nice father I should\\r\\nmake, too! I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me a year\\r\\nago. That’s enough for me. Excuse me, I am just coming to the point.\\r\\nBefore the journey which may come off, I want to settle Mr. Luzhin, too.\\r\\nIt’s not that I detest him so much, but it was through him I quarrelled\\r\\nwith Marfa Petrovna when I learned that she had dished up this marriage.\\r\\nI want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your mediation, and if you\\r\\nlike in your presence, to explain to her that in the first place she\\r\\nwill never gain anything but harm from Mr. Luzhin. Then, begging\\r\\nher pardon for all past unpleasantness, to make her a present of ten\\r\\nthousand roubles and so assist the rupture with Mr. Luzhin, a rupture to\\r\\nwhich I believe she is herself not disinclined, if she could see the way\\r\\nto it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are certainly mad,” cried Raskolnikov not so much angered as\\r\\nastonished. “How dare you talk like that!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I knew you would scream at me; but in the first place, though I am not\\r\\nrich, this ten thousand roubles is perfectly free; I have absolutely no\\r\\nneed for it. If Avdotya Romanovna does not accept it, I shall waste\\r\\nit in some more foolish way. That’s the first thing. Secondly, my\\r\\nconscience is perfectly easy; I make the offer with no ulterior motive.\\r\\nYou may not believe it, but in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you will\\r\\nknow. The point is, that I did actually cause your sister, whom I\\r\\ngreatly respect, some trouble and unpleasantness, and so, sincerely\\r\\nregretting it, I want--not to compensate, not to repay her for the\\r\\nunpleasantness, but simply to do something to her advantage, to show\\r\\nthat I am not, after all, privileged to do nothing but harm. If there\\r\\nwere a millionth fraction of self-interest in my offer, I should not\\r\\nhave made it so openly; and I should not have offered her ten thousand\\r\\nonly, when five weeks ago I offered her more, Besides, I may, perhaps,\\r\\nvery soon marry a young lady, and that alone ought to prevent suspicion\\r\\nof any design on Avdotya Romanovna. In conclusion, let me say that\\r\\nin marrying Mr. Luzhin, she is taking money just the same, only from\\r\\nanother man. Don’t be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, think it over coolly\\r\\nand quietly.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as he was saying\\r\\nthis.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I beg you to say no more,” said Raskolnikov. “In any case this is\\r\\nunpardonable impertinence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not in the least. Then a man may do nothing but harm to his neighbour\\r\\nin this world, and is prevented from doing the tiniest bit of good\\r\\nby trivial conventional formalities. That’s absurd. If I died, for\\r\\ninstance, and left that sum to your sister in my will, surely she\\r\\nwouldn’t refuse it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very likely she would.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no, indeed. However, if you refuse it, so be it, though ten\\r\\nthousand roubles is a capital thing to have on occasion. In any case I\\r\\nbeg you to repeat what I have said to Avdotya Romanovna.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I won’t.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In that case, Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be obliged to try and see her\\r\\nmyself and worry her by doing so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And if I do tell her, will you not try to see her?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know really what to say. I should like very much to see her\\r\\nonce more.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t hope for it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m sorry. But you don’t know me. Perhaps we may become better\\r\\nfriends.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You think we may become friends?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And why not?” Svidrigaïlov said, smiling. He stood up and took his hat.\\r\\n“I didn’t quite intend to disturb you and I came here without reckoning\\r\\non it... though I was very much struck by your face this morning.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where did you see me this morning?” Raskolnikov asked uneasily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I saw you by chance.... I kept fancying there is something about you\\r\\nlike me.... But don’t be uneasy. I am not intrusive; I used to get on\\r\\nall right with card-sharpers, and I never bored Prince Svirbey, a great\\r\\npersonage who is a distant relation of mine, and I could write about\\r\\nRaphael’s _Madonna_ in Madam Prilukov’s album, and I never left Marfa\\r\\nPetrovna’s side for seven years, and I used to stay the night at\\r\\nViazemsky’s house in the Hay Market in the old days, and I may go up in\\r\\na balloon with Berg, perhaps.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, all right. Are you starting soon on your travels, may I ask?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What travels?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, on that ‘journey’; you spoke of it yourself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A journey? Oh, yes. I did speak of a journey. Well, that’s a wide\\r\\nsubject.... if only you knew what you are asking,” he added, and gave\\r\\na sudden, loud, short laugh. “Perhaps I’ll get married instead of the\\r\\njourney. They’re making a match for me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How have you had time for that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I am very anxious to see Avdotya Romanovna once. I earnestly beg\\r\\nit. Well, good-bye for the present. Oh, yes. I have forgotten something.\\r\\nTell your sister, Rodion Romanovitch, that Marfa Petrovna remembered\\r\\nher in her will and left her three thousand roubles. That’s absolutely\\r\\ncertain. Marfa Petrovna arranged it a week before her death, and it was\\r\\ndone in my presence. Avdotya Romanovna will be able to receive the money\\r\\nin two or three weeks.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you telling the truth?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, tell her. Well, your servant. I am staying very near you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he went out, Svidrigaïlov ran up against Razumihin in the doorway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was nearly eight o’clock. The two young men hurried to Bakaleyev’s,\\r\\nto arrive before Luzhin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, who was that?” asked Razumihin, as soon as they were in the\\r\\nstreet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was Svidrigaïlov, that landowner in whose house my sister was\\r\\ninsulted when she was their governess. Through his persecuting her with\\r\\nhis attentions, she was turned out by his wife, Marfa Petrovna. This\\r\\nMarfa Petrovna begged Dounia’s forgiveness afterwards, and she’s just\\r\\ndied suddenly. It was of her we were talking this morning. I don’t\\r\\nknow why I’m afraid of that man. He came here at once after his wife’s\\r\\nfuneral. He is very strange, and is determined on doing something.... We\\r\\nmust guard Dounia from him... that’s what I wanted to tell you, do you\\r\\nhear?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Guard her! What can he do to harm Avdotya Romanovna? Thank you, Rodya,\\r\\nfor speaking to me like that.... We will, we will guard her. Where does\\r\\nhe live?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why didn’t you ask? What a pity! I’ll find out, though.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you see him?” asked Raskolnikov after a pause.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I noticed him, I noticed him well.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You did really see him? You saw him clearly?” Raskolnikov insisted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I remember him perfectly, I should know him in a thousand; I have\\r\\na good memory for faces.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were silent again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hm!... that’s all right,” muttered Raskolnikov. “Do you know, I\\r\\nfancied... I keep thinking that it may have been an hallucination.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean? I don’t understand you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you all say,” Raskolnikov went on, twisting his mouth into a\\r\\nsmile, “that I am mad. I thought just now that perhaps I really am mad,\\r\\nand have only seen a phantom.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, who can tell? Perhaps I am really mad, and perhaps everything that\\r\\nhappened all these days may be only imagination.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ach, Rodya, you have been upset again!... But what did he say, what did\\r\\nhe come for?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov did not answer. Razumihin thought a minute.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now let me tell you my story,” he began, “I came to you, you were\\r\\nasleep. Then we had dinner and then I went to Porfiry’s, Zametov was\\r\\nstill with him. I tried to begin, but it was no use. I couldn’t speak in\\r\\nthe right way. They don’t seem to understand and can’t understand, but\\r\\nare not a bit ashamed. I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking\\r\\nto him, but it was still no use. He looked away and I looked away. At\\r\\nlast I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him as a cousin I’d\\r\\nbrain him. He merely looked at me, I cursed and came away. That was\\r\\nall. It was very stupid. To Zametov I didn’t say a word. But, you see, I\\r\\nthought I’d made a mess of it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea\\r\\nstruck me: why should we trouble? Of course if you were in any danger\\r\\nor anything, but why need you care? You needn’t care a hang for them. We\\r\\nshall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if I were in your place I’d\\r\\nmystify them more than ever. How ashamed they’ll be afterwards! Hang\\r\\nthem! We can thrash them afterwards, but let’s laugh at them now!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To be sure,” answered Raskolnikov. “But what will you say to-morrow?”\\r\\n he thought to himself. Strange to say, till that moment it had never\\r\\noccurred to him to wonder what Razumihin would think when he knew. As he\\r\\nthought it, Raskolnikov looked at him. Razumihin’s account of his visit\\r\\nto Porfiry had very little interest for him, so much had come and gone\\r\\nsince then.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the corridor they came upon Luzhin; he had arrived punctually\\r\\nat eight, and was looking for the number, so that all three went in\\r\\ntogether without greeting or looking at one another. The young men\\r\\nwalked in first, while Pyotr Petrovitch, for good manners, lingered a\\r\\nlittle in the passage, taking off his coat. Pulcheria Alexandrovna came\\r\\nforward at once to greet him in the doorway, Dounia was welcoming her\\r\\nbrother. Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and quite amiably, though with\\r\\nredoubled dignity, bowed to the ladies. He looked, however, as though\\r\\nhe were a little put out and could not yet recover himself. Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna, who seemed also a little embarrassed, hastened to make\\r\\nthem all sit down at the round table where a samovar was boiling. Dounia\\r\\nand Luzhin were facing one another on opposite sides of the table.\\r\\nRazumihin and Raskolnikov were facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna, Razumihin\\r\\nwas next to Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nA moment’s silence followed. Pyotr Petrovitch deliberately drew out a\\r\\ncambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of\\r\\na benevolent man who felt himself slighted, and was firmly resolved to\\r\\ninsist on an explanation. In the passage the idea had occurred to him to\\r\\nkeep on his overcoat and walk away, and so give the two ladies a sharp\\r\\nand emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position.\\r\\nBut he could not bring himself to do this. Besides, he could not endure\\r\\nuncertainty, and he wanted an explanation: if his request had been so\\r\\nopenly disobeyed, there was something behind it, and in that case it was\\r\\nbetter to find it out beforehand; it rested with him to punish them and\\r\\nthere would always be time for that.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I trust you had a favourable journey,” he inquired officially of\\r\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, very, Pyotr Petrovitch.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am gratified to hear it. And Avdotya Romanovna is not over-fatigued\\r\\neither?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am young and strong, I don’t get tired, but it was a great strain for\\r\\nmother,” answered Dounia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s unavoidable! our national railways are of terrible length.\\r\\n‘Mother Russia,’ as they say, is a vast country.... In spite of all my\\r\\ndesire to do so, I was unable to meet you yesterday. But I trust all\\r\\npassed off without inconvenience?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was all terribly disheartening,” Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna hastened to declare with peculiar intonation, “and if\\r\\nDmitri Prokofitch had not been sent us, I really believe by God Himself,\\r\\nwe should have been utterly lost. Here, he is! Dmitri Prokofitch\\r\\nRazumihin,” she added, introducing him to Luzhin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had the pleasure... yesterday,” muttered Pyotr Petrovitch with a\\r\\nhostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he scowled and was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on the surface very\\r\\npolite in society, who make a great point of punctiliousness, but who,\\r\\ndirectly they are crossed in anything, are completely disconcerted, and\\r\\nbecome more like sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society.\\r\\nAgain all was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute, Avdotya\\r\\nRomanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too soon. Razumihin had\\r\\nnothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexandrovna was anxious again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Marfa Petrovna is dead, have you heard?” she began having recourse to\\r\\nher leading item of conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To be sure, I heard so. I was immediately informed, and I have come to\\r\\nmake you acquainted with the fact that Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov\\r\\nset off in haste for Petersburg immediately after his wife’s funeral. So\\r\\nat least I have excellent authority for believing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To Petersburg? here?” Dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, having in view the\\r\\nrapidity of his departure, and all the circumstances preceding it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens! won’t he leave Dounia in peace even here?” cried\\r\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna have any grounds for\\r\\nuneasiness, unless, of course, you are yourselves desirous of getting\\r\\ninto communication with him. For my part I am on my guard, and am now\\r\\ndiscovering where he is lodging.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright you have\\r\\ngiven me,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on: “I’ve only seen him twice,\\r\\nbut I thought him terrible, terrible! I am convinced that he was the\\r\\ncause of Marfa Petrovna’s death.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s impossible to be certain about that. I have precise information. I\\r\\ndo not dispute that he may have contributed to accelerate the course of\\r\\nevents by the moral influence, so to say, of the affront; but as to the\\r\\ngeneral conduct and moral characteristics of that personage, I am\\r\\nin agreement with you. I do not know whether he is well off now, and\\r\\nprecisely what Marfa Petrovna left him; this will be known to me within\\r\\na very short period; but no doubt here in Petersburg, if he has any\\r\\npecuniary resources, he will relapse at once into his old ways. He is\\r\\nthe most depraved, and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men.\\r\\nI have considerable reason to believe that Marfa Petrovna, who was so\\r\\nunfortunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight years\\r\\nago, was of service to him also in another way. Solely by her exertions\\r\\nand sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving an element of fantastic\\r\\nand homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced to\\r\\nSiberia, was hushed up. That’s the sort of man he is, if you care to\\r\\nknow.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Raskolnikov listened\\r\\nattentively.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of\\r\\nthis?” Dounia asked sternly and emphatically.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa Petrovna. I must\\r\\nobserve that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear.\\r\\nThere was, and I believe still is, living here a woman called Resslich,\\r\\na foreigner, who lent small sums of money at interest, and did other\\r\\ncommissions, and with this woman Svidrigaïlov had for a long while close\\r\\nand mysterious relations. She had a relation, a niece I believe, living\\r\\nwith her, a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or perhaps not more than\\r\\nfourteen. Resslich hated this girl, and grudged her every crust; she\\r\\nused to beat her mercilessly. One day the girl was found hanging in\\r\\nthe garret. At the inquest the verdict was suicide. After the usual\\r\\nproceedings the matter ended, but, later on, information was given that\\r\\nthe child had been... cruelly outraged by Svidrigaïlov. It is true, this\\r\\nwas not clearly established, the information was given by another German\\r\\nwoman of loose character whose word could not be trusted; no statement\\r\\nwas actually made to the police, thanks to Marfa Petrovna’s money and\\r\\nexertions; it did not get beyond gossip. And yet the story is a very\\r\\nsignificant one. You heard, no doubt, Avdotya Romanovna, when you were\\r\\nwith them the story of the servant Philip who died of ill treatment he\\r\\nreceived six years ago, before the abolition of serfdom.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged himself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps disposed him,\\r\\nto suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of Mr.\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know that,” answered Dounia, dryly. “I only heard a queer story\\r\\nthat Philip was a sort of hypochondriac, a sort of domestic philosopher,\\r\\nthe servants used to say, ‘he read himself silly,’ and that he hanged\\r\\nhimself partly on account of Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s mockery of him and not\\r\\nhis blows. When I was there he behaved well to the servants, and they\\r\\nwere actually fond of him, though they certainly did blame him for\\r\\nPhilip’s death.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I perceive, Avdotya Romanovna, that you seem disposed to undertake his\\r\\ndefence all of a sudden,” Luzhin observed, twisting his lips into\\r\\nan ambiguous smile, “there’s no doubt that he is an astute man, and\\r\\ninsinuating where ladies are concerned, of which Marfa Petrovna, who has\\r\\ndied so strangely, is a terrible instance. My only desire has been to be\\r\\nof service to you and your mother with my advice, in view of the renewed\\r\\nefforts which may certainly be anticipated from him. For my part it’s\\r\\nmy firm conviction, that he will end in a debtor’s prison again.\\r\\nMarfa Petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anything\\r\\nsubstantial on him, having regard for his children’s interests, and,\\r\\nif she left him anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency,\\r\\nsomething insignificant and ephemeral, which would not last a year for a\\r\\nman of his habits.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pyotr Petrovitch, I beg you,” said Dounia, “say no more of Mr.\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov. It makes me miserable.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has just been to see me,” said Raskolnikov, breaking his silence for\\r\\nthe first time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were exclamations from all, and they all turned to him. Even Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch was roused.\\r\\n\\r\\n“An hour and a half ago, he came in when I was asleep, waked me, and\\r\\nintroduced himself,” Raskolnikov continued. “He was fairly cheerful\\r\\nand at ease, and quite hopes that we shall become friends. He is\\r\\nparticularly anxious, by the way, Dounia, for an interview with you, at\\r\\nwhich he asked me to assist. He has a proposition to make to you, and\\r\\nhe told me about it. He told me, too, that a week before her death Marfa\\r\\nPetrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, Dounia, and that\\r\\nyou can receive the money very shortly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank God!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself. “Pray for\\r\\nher soul, Dounia!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a fact!” broke from Luzhin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell us, what more?” Dounia urged Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then he said that he wasn’t rich and all the estate was left to his\\r\\nchildren who are now with an aunt, then that he was staying somewhere\\r\\nnot far from me, but where, I don’t know, I didn’t ask....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what, what does he want to propose to Dounia?” cried Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna in a fright. “Did he tell you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What was it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll tell you afterwards.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention to his tea.\\r\\n\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am compelled to keep a business engagement, and so I shall not be in\\r\\nyour way,” he added with an air of some pique and he began getting up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t go, Pyotr Petrovitch,” said Dounia, “you intended to spend\\r\\nthe evening. Besides, you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an\\r\\nexplanation with mother.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Precisely so, Avdotya Romanovna,” Pyotr Petrovitch answered\\r\\nimpressively, sitting down again, but still holding his hat. “I\\r\\ncertainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured mother upon\\r\\na very important point indeed. But as your brother cannot speak openly\\r\\nin my presence of some proposals of Mr. Svidrigaïlov, I, too, do not\\r\\ndesire and am not able to speak openly... in the presence of others...\\r\\nof certain matters of the greatest gravity. Moreover, my most weighty\\r\\nand urgent request has been disregarded....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAssuming an aggrieved air, Luzhin relapsed into dignified silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your request that my brother should not be present at our meeting was\\r\\ndisregarded solely at my insistance,” said Dounia. “You wrote that you\\r\\nhad been insulted by my brother; I think that this must be explained at\\r\\nonce, and you must be reconciled. And if Rodya really has insulted you,\\r\\nthen he _should_ and _will_ apologise.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch took a stronger line.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are insults, Avdotya Romanovna, which no goodwill can make us\\r\\nforget. There is a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep;\\r\\nand when it has been overstepped, there is no return.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That wasn’t what I was speaking of exactly, Pyotr Petrovitch,” Dounia\\r\\ninterrupted with some impatience. “Please understand that our whole\\r\\nfuture depends now on whether all this is explained and set right as\\r\\nsoon as possible. I tell you frankly at the start that I cannot look at\\r\\nit in any other light, and if you have the least regard for me, all this\\r\\nbusiness must be ended to-day, however hard that may be. I repeat that\\r\\nif my brother is to blame he will ask your forgiveness.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am surprised at your putting the question like that,” said Luzhin,\\r\\ngetting more and more irritated. “Esteeming, and so to say, adoring you,\\r\\nI may at the same time, very well indeed, be able to dislike some member\\r\\nof your family. Though I lay claim to the happiness of your hand, I\\r\\ncannot accept duties incompatible with...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, don’t be so ready to take offence, Pyotr Petrovitch,” Dounia\\r\\ninterrupted with feeling, “and be the sensible and generous man I have\\r\\nalways considered, and wish to consider, you to be. I’ve given you a\\r\\ngreat promise, I am your betrothed. Trust me in this matter and, believe\\r\\nme, I shall be capable of judging impartially. My assuming the part of\\r\\njudge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you. When I insisted\\r\\non his coming to our interview to-day after your letter, I told\\r\\nhim nothing of what I meant to do. Understand that, if you are not\\r\\nreconciled, I must choose between you--it must be either you or he. That\\r\\nis how the question rests on your side and on his. I don’t want to be\\r\\nmistaken in my choice, and I must not be. For your sake I must break off\\r\\nwith my brother, for my brother’s sake I must break off with you. I can\\r\\nfind out for certain now whether he is a brother to me, and I want to\\r\\nknow it; and of you, whether I am dear to you, whether you esteem me,\\r\\nwhether you are the husband for me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Avdotya Romanovna,” Luzhin declared huffily, “your words are of too\\r\\nmuch consequence to me; I will say more, they are offensive in view\\r\\nof the position I have the honour to occupy in relation to you. To say\\r\\nnothing of your strange and offensive setting me on a level with an\\r\\nimpertinent boy, you admit the possibility of breaking your promise to\\r\\nme. You say ‘you or he,’ showing thereby of how little consequence I\\r\\nam in your eyes... I cannot let this pass considering the relationship\\r\\nand... the obligations existing between us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What!” cried Dounia, flushing. “I set your interest beside all that has\\r\\nhitherto been most precious in my life, what has made up the _whole_ of\\r\\nmy life, and here you are offended at my making too _little_ account of\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov smiled sarcastically, Razumihin fidgeted, but Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch did not accept the reproof; on the contrary, at every word he\\r\\nbecame more persistent and irritable, as though he relished it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Love for the future partner of your life, for your husband, ought to\\r\\noutweigh your love for your brother,” he pronounced sententiously, “and\\r\\nin any case I cannot be put on the same level.... Although I said so\\r\\nemphatically that I would not speak openly in your brother’s presence,\\r\\nnevertheless, I intend now to ask your honoured mother for a necessary\\r\\nexplanation on a point of great importance closely affecting my dignity.\\r\\nYour son,” he turned to Pulcheria Alexandrovna, “yesterday in the\\r\\npresence of Mr. Razsudkin (or... I think that’s it? excuse me I have\\r\\nforgotten your surname,” he bowed politely to Razumihin) “insulted me by\\r\\nmisrepresenting the idea I expressed to you in a private conversation,\\r\\ndrinking coffee, that is, that marriage with a poor girl who has had\\r\\nexperience of trouble is more advantageous from the conjugal point of\\r\\nview than with one who has lived in luxury, since it is more profitable\\r\\nfor the moral character. Your son intentionally exaggerated the\\r\\nsignificance of my words and made them ridiculous, accusing me of\\r\\nmalicious intentions, and, as far as I could see, relied upon your\\r\\ncorrespondence with him. I shall consider myself happy, Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna, if it is possible for you to convince me of an opposite\\r\\nconclusion, and thereby considerately reassure me. Kindly let me know\\r\\nin what terms precisely you repeated my words in your letter to Rodion\\r\\nRomanovitch.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t remember,” faltered Pulcheria Alexandrovna. “I repeated them as\\r\\nI understood them. I don’t know how Rodya repeated them to you, perhaps\\r\\nhe exaggerated.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He could not have exaggerated them, except at your instigation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pyotr Petrovitch,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared with dignity, “the\\r\\nproof that Dounia and I did not take your words in a very bad sense is\\r\\nthe fact that we are here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good, mother,” said Dounia approvingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then this is my fault again,” said Luzhin, aggrieved.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Pyotr Petrovitch, you keep blaming Rodion, but you yourself have\\r\\njust written what was false about him,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna added,\\r\\ngaining courage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t remember writing anything false.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You wrote,” Raskolnikov said sharply, not turning to Luzhin, “that I\\r\\ngave money yesterday not to the widow of the man who was killed, as was\\r\\nthe fact, but to his daughter (whom I had never seen till yesterday).\\r\\nYou wrote this to make dissension between me and my family, and for that\\r\\nobject added coarse expressions about the conduct of a girl whom you\\r\\ndon’t know. All that is mean slander.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me, sir,” said Luzhin, quivering with fury. “I enlarged upon\\r\\nyour qualities and conduct in my letter solely in response to your\\r\\nsister’s and mother’s inquiries, how I found you, and what impression\\r\\nyou made on me. As for what you’ve alluded to in my letter, be so good\\r\\nas to point out one word of falsehood, show, that is, that you didn’t\\r\\nthrow away your money, and that there are not worthless persons in that\\r\\nfamily, however unfortunate.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To my thinking, you, with all your virtues, are not worth the little\\r\\nfinger of that unfortunate girl at whom you throw stones.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Would you go so far then as to let her associate with your mother and\\r\\nsister?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have done so already, if you care to know. I made her sit down to-day\\r\\nwith mother and Dounia.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rodya!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Dounia crimsoned, Razumihin\\r\\nknitted his brows. Luzhin smiled with lofty sarcasm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You may see for yourself, Avdotya Romanovna,” he said, “whether it is\\r\\npossible for us to agree. I hope now that this question is at an end,\\r\\nonce and for all. I will withdraw, that I may not hinder the pleasures\\r\\nof family intimacy, and the discussion of secrets.” He got up from his\\r\\nchair and took his hat. “But in withdrawing, I venture to request\\r\\nthat for the future I may be spared similar meetings, and, so to\\r\\nsay, compromises. I appeal particularly to you, honoured Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna, on this subject, the more as my letter was addressed to\\r\\nyou and to no one else.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was a little offended.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You seem to think we are completely under your authority, Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch. Dounia has told you the reason your desire was disregarded,\\r\\nshe had the best intentions. And indeed you write as though you were\\r\\nlaying commands upon me. Are we to consider every desire of yours as\\r\\na command? Let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to show\\r\\nparticular delicacy and consideration for us now, because we have thrown\\r\\nup everything, and have come here relying on you, and so we are in any\\r\\ncase in a sense in your hands.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is not quite true, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, especially at the\\r\\npresent moment, when the news has come of Marfa Petrovna’s legacy, which\\r\\nseems indeed very apropos, judging from the new tone you take to me,” he\\r\\nadded sarcastically.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Judging from that remark, we may certainly presume that you were\\r\\nreckoning on our helplessness,” Dounia observed irritably.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But now in any case I cannot reckon on it, and I particularly desire\\r\\nnot to hinder your discussion of the secret proposals of Arkady\\r\\nIvanovitch Svidrigaïlov, which he has entrusted to your brother and\\r\\nwhich have, I perceive, a great and possibly a very agreeable interest\\r\\nfor you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\r\\n\\r\\nRazumihin could not sit still on his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Aren’t you ashamed now, sister?” asked Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am ashamed, Rodya,” said Dounia. “Pyotr Petrovitch, go away,” she\\r\\nturned to him, white with anger.\\r\\n\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such a conclusion.\\r\\nHe had too much confidence in himself, in his power and in the\\r\\nhelplessness of his victims. He could not believe it even now. He turned\\r\\npale, and his lips quivered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Avdotya Romanovna, if I go out of this door now, after such a\\r\\ndismissal, then, you may reckon on it, I will never come back. Consider\\r\\nwhat you are doing. My word is not to be shaken.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What insolence!” cried Dounia, springing up from her seat. “I don’t\\r\\nwant you to come back again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What! So that’s how it stands!” cried Luzhin, utterly unable to the\\r\\nlast moment to believe in the rupture and so completely thrown out of\\r\\nhis reckoning now. “So that’s how it stands! But do you know, Avdotya\\r\\nRomanovna, that I might protest?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What right have you to speak to her like that?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\\r\\nintervened hotly. “And what can you protest about? What rights have you?\\r\\nAm I to give my Dounia to a man like you? Go away, leave us altogether!\\r\\nWe are to blame for having agreed to a wrong action, and I above\\r\\nall....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you have bound me, Pulcheria Alexandrovna,” Luzhin stormed in a\\r\\nfrenzy, “by your promise, and now you deny it and... besides... I have\\r\\nbeen led on account of that into expenses....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis last complaint was so characteristic of Pyotr Petrovitch, that\\r\\nRaskolnikov, pale with anger and with the effort of restraining it,\\r\\ncould not help breaking into laughter. But Pulcheria Alexandrovna was\\r\\nfurious.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Expenses? What expenses? Are you speaking of our trunk? But the\\r\\nconductor brought it for nothing for you. Mercy on us, we have bound\\r\\nyou! What are you thinking about, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was you bound us,\\r\\nhand and foot, not we!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Enough, mother, no more please,” Avdotya Romanovna implored. “Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch, do be kind and go!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am going, but one last word,” he said, quite unable to control\\r\\nhimself. “Your mamma seems to have entirely forgotten that I made up my\\r\\nmind to take you, so to speak, after the gossip of the town had spread\\r\\nall over the district in regard to your reputation. Disregarding public\\r\\nopinion for your sake and reinstating your reputation, I certainly\\r\\nmight very well reckon on a fitting return, and might indeed look for\\r\\ngratitude on your part. And my eyes have only now been opened! I see\\r\\nmyself that I may have acted very, very recklessly in disregarding the\\r\\nuniversal verdict....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Does the fellow want his head smashed?” cried Razumihin, jumping up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a mean and spiteful man!” cried Dounia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a word! Not a movement!” cried Raskolnikov, holding Razumihin back;\\r\\nthen going close up to Luzhin, “Kindly leave the room!” he said quietly\\r\\nand distinctly, “and not a word more or...”\\r\\n\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds with a pale face that\\r\\nworked with anger, then he turned, went out, and rarely has any man\\r\\ncarried away in his heart such vindictive hatred as he felt against\\r\\nRaskolnikov. Him, and him alone, he blamed for everything. It is\\r\\nnoteworthy that as he went downstairs he still imagined that his case\\r\\nwas perhaps not utterly lost, and that, so far as the ladies were\\r\\nconcerned, all might “very well indeed” be set right again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact was that up to the last moment he had never expected such an\\r\\nending; he had been overbearing to the last degree, never dreaming that\\r\\ntwo destitute and defenceless women could escape from his control. This\\r\\nconviction was strengthened by his vanity and conceit, a conceit to\\r\\nthe point of fatuity. Pyotr Petrovitch, who had made his way up from\\r\\ninsignificance, was morbidly given to self-admiration, had the highest\\r\\nopinion of his intelligence and capacities, and sometimes even gloated\\r\\nin solitude over his image in the glass. But what he loved and valued\\r\\nabove all was the money he had amassed by his labour, and by all sorts\\r\\nof devices: that money made him the equal of all who had been his\\r\\nsuperiors.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had bitterly reminded Dounia that he had decided to take her in\\r\\nspite of evil report, Pyotr Petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincerity\\r\\nand had, indeed, felt genuinely indignant at such “black ingratitude.”\\r\\n And yet, when he made Dounia his offer, he was fully aware of the\\r\\ngroundlessness of all the gossip. The story had been everywhere\\r\\ncontradicted by Marfa Petrovna, and was by then disbelieved by all the\\r\\ntownspeople, who were warm in Dounia’a defence. And he would not have\\r\\ndenied that he knew all that at the time. Yet he still thought highly\\r\\nof his own resolution in lifting Dounia to his level and regarded it as\\r\\nsomething heroic. In speaking of it to Dounia, he had let out the secret\\r\\nfeeling he cherished and admired, and he could not understand that\\r\\nothers should fail to admire it too. He had called on Raskolnikov with\\r\\nthe feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his good\\r\\ndeeds and to hear agreeable flattery. And as he went downstairs now, he\\r\\nconsidered himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised.\\r\\n\\r\\nDounia was simply essential to him; to do without her was unthinkable.\\r\\nFor many years he had had voluptuous dreams of marriage, but he had\\r\\ngone on waiting and amassing money. He brooded with relish, in profound\\r\\nsecret, over the image of a girl--virtuous, poor (she must be poor),\\r\\nvery young, very pretty, of good birth and education, very timid, one\\r\\nwho had suffered much, and was completely humbled before him, one who\\r\\nwould all her life look on him as her saviour, worship him, admire him\\r\\nand only him. How many scenes, how many amorous episodes he had imagined\\r\\non this seductive and playful theme, when his work was over! And,\\r\\nbehold, the dream of so many years was all but realised; the beauty and\\r\\neducation of Avdotya Romanovna had impressed him; her helpless position\\r\\nhad been a great allurement; in her he had found even more than he\\r\\ndreamed of. Here was a girl of pride, character, virtue, of education\\r\\nand breeding superior to his own (he felt that), and this creature would\\r\\nbe slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension, and\\r\\nwould humble herself in the dust before him, and he would have absolute,\\r\\nunbounded power over her!... Not long before, he had, too, after long\\r\\nreflection and hesitation, made an important change in his career and\\r\\nwas now entering on a wider circle of business. With this change his\\r\\ncherished dreams of rising into a higher class of society seemed likely\\r\\nto be realised.... He was, in fact, determined to try his fortune\\r\\nin Petersburg. He knew that women could do a very great deal. The\\r\\nfascination of a charming, virtuous, highly educated woman might make\\r\\nhis way easier, might do wonders in attracting people to him, throwing\\r\\nan aureole round him, and now everything was in ruins! This sudden\\r\\nhorrible rupture affected him like a clap of thunder; it was like a\\r\\nhideous joke, an absurdity. He had only been a tiny bit masterful,\\r\\nhad not even time to speak out, had simply made a joke, been carried\\r\\naway--and it had ended so seriously. And, of course, too, he did love\\r\\nDounia in his own way; he already possessed her in his dreams--and all\\r\\nat once! No! The next day, the very next day, it must all be set right,\\r\\nsmoothed over, settled. Above all he must crush that conceited milksop\\r\\nwho was the cause of it all. With a sick feeling he could not help\\r\\nrecalling Razumihin too, but, he soon reassured himself on that score;\\r\\nas though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him! The man\\r\\nhe really dreaded in earnest was Svidrigaïlov.... He had, in short, a\\r\\ngreat deal to attend to....\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I, I am more to blame than anyone!” said Dounia, kissing and\\r\\nembracing her mother. “I was tempted by his money, but on my honour,\\r\\nbrother, I had no idea he was such a base man. If I had seen through him\\r\\nbefore, nothing would have tempted me! Don’t blame me, brother!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“God has delivered us! God has delivered us!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\\r\\nmuttered, but half consciously, as though scarcely able to realise what\\r\\nhad happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were all relieved, and in five minutes they were laughing. Only now\\r\\nand then Dounia turned white and frowned, remembering what had passed.\\r\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was surprised to find that she, too, was glad:\\r\\nshe had only that morning thought rupture with Luzhin a terrible\\r\\nmisfortune. Razumihin was delighted. He did not yet dare to express his\\r\\njoy fully, but he was in a fever of excitement as though a ton-weight\\r\\nhad fallen off his heart. Now he had the right to devote his life to\\r\\nthem, to serve them.... Anything might happen now! But he felt afraid to\\r\\nthink of further possibilities and dared not let his imagination\\r\\nrange. But Raskolnikov sat still in the same place, almost sullen and\\r\\nindifferent. Though he had been the most insistent on getting rid of\\r\\nLuzhin, he seemed now the least concerned at what had happened. Dounia\\r\\ncould not help thinking that he was still angry with her, and Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna watched him timidly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did Svidrigaïlov say to you?” said Dounia, approaching him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov raised his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles and he desires\\r\\nto see you once in my presence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“See her! On no account!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. “And how dare he\\r\\noffer her money!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Raskolnikov repeated (rather dryly) his conversation with\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov, omitting his account of the ghostly visitations of Marfa\\r\\nPetrovna, wishing to avoid all unnecessary talk.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What answer did you give him?” asked Dounia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At first I said I would not take any message to you. Then he said that\\r\\nhe would do his utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help.\\r\\nHe assured me that his passion for you was a passing infatuation, now he\\r\\nhas no feeling for you. He doesn’t want you to marry Luzhin.... His talk\\r\\nwas altogether rather muddled.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you explain him to yourself, Rodya? How did he strike you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must confess I don’t quite understand him. He offers you ten\\r\\nthousand, and yet says he is not well off. He says he is going away, and\\r\\nin ten minutes he forgets he has said it. Then he says he is going to be\\r\\nmarried and has already fixed on the girl.... No doubt he has a motive,\\r\\nand probably a bad one. But it’s odd that he should be so clumsy about\\r\\nit if he had any designs against you.... Of course, I refused this\\r\\nmoney on your account, once for all. Altogether, I thought him very\\r\\nstrange.... One might almost think he was mad. But I may be mistaken;\\r\\nthat may only be the part he assumes. The death of Marfa Petrovna seems\\r\\nto have made a great impression on him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“God rest her soul,” exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna. “I shall always,\\r\\nalways pray for her! Where should we be now, Dounia, without this three\\r\\nthousand! It’s as though it had fallen from heaven! Why, Rodya, this\\r\\nmorning we had only three roubles in our pocket and Dounia and I were\\r\\njust planning to pawn her watch, so as to avoid borrowing from that man\\r\\nuntil he offered help.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDounia seemed strangely impressed by Svidrigaïlov’s offer. She still\\r\\nstood meditating.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has got some terrible plan,” she said in a half whisper to herself,\\r\\nalmost shuddering.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I fancy I shall have to see him more than once again,” he said to\\r\\nDounia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We will watch him! I will track him out!” cried Razumihin, vigorously.\\r\\n“I won’t lose sight of him. Rodya has given me leave. He said to me\\r\\nhimself just now. ‘Take care of my sister.’ Will you give me leave, too,\\r\\nAvdotya Romanovna?”\\r\\n\\r\\nDounia smiled and held out her hand, but the look of anxiety did not\\r\\nleave her face. Pulcheria Alexandrovna gazed at her timidly, but the\\r\\nthree thousand roubles had obviously a soothing effect on her.\\r\\n\\r\\nA quarter of an hour later, they were all engaged in a lively\\r\\nconversation. Even Raskolnikov listened attentively for some time,\\r\\nthough he did not talk. Razumihin was the speaker.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And why, why should you go away?” he flowed on ecstatically. “And what\\r\\nare you to do in a little town? The great thing is, you are all here\\r\\ntogether and you need one another--you do need one another, believe me.\\r\\nFor a time, anyway.... Take me into partnership, and I assure you we’ll\\r\\nplan a capital enterprise. Listen! I’ll explain it all in detail to\\r\\nyou, the whole project! It all flashed into my head this morning,\\r\\nbefore anything had happened... I tell you what; I have an uncle, I must\\r\\nintroduce him to you (a most accommodating and respectable old man).\\r\\nThis uncle has got a capital of a thousand roubles, and he lives on his\\r\\npension and has no need of that money. For the last two years he has\\r\\nbeen bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six per cent.\\r\\ninterest. I know what that means; he simply wants to help me. Last year\\r\\nI had no need of it, but this year I resolved to borrow it as soon as\\r\\nhe arrived. Then you lend me another thousand of your three and we have\\r\\nenough for a start, so we’ll go into partnership, and what are we going\\r\\nto do?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Razumihin began to unfold his project, and he explained at length\\r\\nthat almost all our publishers and booksellers know nothing at all\\r\\nof what they are selling, and for that reason they are usually bad\\r\\npublishers, and that any decent publications pay as a rule and give\\r\\na profit, sometimes a considerable one. Razumihin had, indeed, been\\r\\ndreaming of setting up as a publisher. For the last two years he had\\r\\nbeen working in publishers’ offices, and knew three European languages\\r\\nwell, though he had told Raskolnikov six days before that he was\\r\\n“schwach” in German with an object of persuading him to take half his\\r\\ntranslation and half the payment for it. He had told a lie then, and\\r\\nRaskolnikov knew he was lying.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, why should we let our chance slip when we have one of the chief\\r\\nmeans of success--money of our own!” cried Razumihin warmly. “Of course\\r\\nthere will be a lot of work, but we will work, you, Avdotya Romanovna,\\r\\nI, Rodion.... You get a splendid profit on some books nowadays! And\\r\\nthe great point of the business is that we shall know just what wants\\r\\ntranslating, and we shall be translating, publishing, learning all at\\r\\nonce. I can be of use because I have experience. For nearly two years\\r\\nI’ve been scuttling about among the publishers, and now I know every\\r\\ndetail of their business. You need not be a saint to make pots, believe\\r\\nme! And why, why should we let our chance slip! Why, I know--and I kept\\r\\nthe secret--two or three books which one might get a hundred roubles\\r\\nsimply for thinking of translating and publishing. Indeed, and I would\\r\\nnot take five hundred for the very idea of one of them. And what do you\\r\\nthink? If I were to tell a publisher, I dare say he’d hesitate--they are\\r\\nsuch blockheads! And as for the business side, printing, paper, selling,\\r\\nyou trust to me, I know my way about. We’ll begin in a small way and go\\r\\non to a large. In any case it will get us our living and we shall get\\r\\nback our capital.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDounia’s eyes shone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I like what you are saying, Dmitri Prokofitch!” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know nothing about it, of course,” put in Pulcheria Alexandrovna,\\r\\n“it may be a good idea, but again God knows. It’s new and untried. Of\\r\\ncourse, we must remain here at least for a time.” She looked at Rodya.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you think, brother?” said Dounia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think he’s got a very good idea,” he answered. “Of course, it’s too\\r\\nsoon to dream of a publishing firm, but we certainly might bring out\\r\\nfive or six books and be sure of success. I know of one book myself\\r\\nwhich would be sure to go well. And as for his being able to manage it,\\r\\nthere’s no doubt about that either. He knows the business.... But we can\\r\\ntalk it over later....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hurrah!” cried Razumihin. “Now, stay, there’s a flat here in this\\r\\nhouse, belonging to the same owner. It’s a special flat apart, not\\r\\ncommunicating with these lodgings. It’s furnished, rent moderate,\\r\\nthree rooms. Suppose you take them to begin with. I’ll pawn your watch\\r\\nto-morrow and bring you the money, and everything can be arranged then.\\r\\nYou can all three live together, and Rodya will be with you. But where\\r\\nare you off to, Rodya?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What, Rodya, you are going already?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in\\r\\ndismay.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At such a minute?” cried Razumihin.\\r\\n\\r\\nDounia looked at her brother with incredulous wonder. He held his cap in\\r\\nhis hand, he was preparing to leave them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One would think you were burying me or saying good-bye for ever,” he\\r\\nsaid somewhat oddly. He attempted to smile, but it did not turn out a\\r\\nsmile. “But who knows, perhaps it is the last time we shall see each\\r\\nother...” he let slip accidentally. It was what he was thinking, and it\\r\\nsomehow was uttered aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is the matter with you?” cried his mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where are you going, Rodya?” asked Dounia rather strangely.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I’m quite obliged to...” he answered vaguely, as though hesitating\\r\\nwhat he would say. But there was a look of sharp determination in his\\r\\nwhite face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I meant to say... as I was coming here... I meant to tell you, mother,\\r\\nand you, Dounia, that it would be better for us to part for a time. I\\r\\nfeel ill, I am not at peace.... I will come afterwards, I will come of\\r\\nmyself... when it’s possible. I remember you and love you.... Leave me,\\r\\nleave me alone. I decided this even before... I’m absolutely resolved on\\r\\nit. Whatever may come to me, whether I come to ruin or not, I want to be\\r\\nalone. Forget me altogether, it’s better. Don’t inquire about me. When\\r\\nI can, I’ll come of myself or... I’ll send for you. Perhaps it will all\\r\\ncome back, but now if you love me, give me up... else I shall begin to\\r\\nhate you, I feel it.... Good-bye!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good God!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Both his mother and his sister\\r\\nwere terribly alarmed. Razumihin was also.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rodya, Rodya, be reconciled with us! Let us be as before!” cried his\\r\\npoor mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the room. Dounia\\r\\novertook him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Brother, what are you doing to mother?” she whispered, her eyes\\r\\nflashing with indignation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked dully at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No matter, I shall come.... I’m coming,” he muttered in an undertone,\\r\\nas though not fully conscious of what he was saying, and he went out of\\r\\nthe room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wicked, heartless egoist!” cried Dounia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is insane, but not heartless. He is mad! Don’t you see it? You’re\\r\\nheartless after that!” Razumihin whispered in her ear, squeezing\\r\\nher hand tightly. “I shall be back directly,” he shouted to the\\r\\nhorror-stricken mother, and he ran out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov was waiting for him at the end of the passage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I knew you would run after me,” he said. “Go back to them--be with\\r\\nthem... be with them to-morrow and always.... I... perhaps I shall\\r\\ncome... if I can. Good-bye.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd without holding out his hand he walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But where are you going? What are you doing? What’s the matter with\\r\\nyou? How can you go on like this?” Razumihin muttered, at his wits’ end.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov stopped once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Once for all, never ask me about anything. I have nothing to tell you.\\r\\nDon’t come to see me. Maybe I’ll come here.... Leave me, but _don’t\\r\\nleave_ them. Do you understand me?”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was dark in the corridor, they were standing near the lamp. For a\\r\\nminute they were looking at one another in silence. Razumihin remembered\\r\\nthat minute all his life. Raskolnikov’s burning and intent eyes\\r\\ngrew more penetrating every moment, piercing into his soul, into his\\r\\nconsciousness. Suddenly Razumihin started. Something strange, as it\\r\\nwere, passed between them.... Some idea, some hint, as it were, slipped,\\r\\nsomething awful, hideous, and suddenly understood on both sides....\\r\\nRazumihin turned pale.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you understand now?” said Raskolnikov, his face twitching nervously.\\r\\n“Go back, go to them,” he said suddenly, and turning quickly, he went\\r\\nout of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will not attempt to describe how Razumihin went back to the ladies,\\r\\nhow he soothed them, how he protested that Rodya needed rest in his\\r\\nillness, protested that Rodya was sure to come, that he would come every\\r\\nday, that he was very, very much upset, that he must not be irritated,\\r\\nthat he, Razumihin, would watch over him, would get him a doctor, the\\r\\nbest doctor, a consultation.... In fact from that evening Razumihin took\\r\\nhis place with them as a son and a brother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where Sonia\\r\\nlived. It was an old green house of three storeys. He found the\\r\\nporter and obtained from him vague directions as to the whereabouts of\\r\\nKapernaumov, the tailor. Having found in the corner of the courtyard\\r\\nthe entrance to the dark and narrow staircase, he mounted to the second\\r\\nfloor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storey\\r\\nover the yard. While he was wandering in the darkness, uncertain where\\r\\nto turn for Kapernaumov’s door, a door opened three paces from him; he\\r\\nmechanically took hold of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who is there?” a woman’s voice asked uneasily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s I... come to see you,” answered Raskolnikov and he walked into the\\r\\ntiny entry.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s you! Good heavens!” cried Sonia weakly, and she stood rooted to\\r\\nthe spot.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Which is your room? This way?” and Raskolnikov, trying not to look at\\r\\nher, hastened in.\\r\\n\\r\\nA minute later Sonia, too, came in with the candle, set down the\\r\\ncandlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood before him inexpressibly\\r\\nagitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit. The colour\\r\\nrushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes... She\\r\\nfelt sick and ashamed and happy, too.... Raskolnikov turned away quickly\\r\\nand sat on a chair by the table. He scanned the room in a rapid glance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only one let by the\\r\\nKapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door led in the wall on the left.\\r\\nIn the opposite side on the right hand wall was another door, always\\r\\nkept locked. That led to the next flat, which formed a separate lodging.\\r\\nSonia’s room looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle and\\r\\nthis gave it a grotesque appearance. A wall with three windows looking\\r\\nout on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute\\r\\nangle, and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light.\\r\\nThe other corner was disproportionately obtuse. There was scarcely any\\r\\nfurniture in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead,\\r\\nbeside it, nearest the door, a chair. A plain, deal table covered by a\\r\\nblue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the door into the other\\r\\nflat. Two rush-bottom chairs stood by the table. On the opposite\\r\\nwall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawers\\r\\nlooking, as it were, lost in a desert. That was all there was in the\\r\\nroom. The yellow, scratched and shabby wall-paper was black in the\\r\\ncorners. It must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter. There\\r\\nwas every sign of poverty; even the bedstead had no curtain.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was so attentively and\\r\\nunceremoniously scrutinising her room, and even began at last to tremble\\r\\nwith terror, as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter\\r\\nof her destinies.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am late.... It’s eleven, isn’t it?” he asked, still not lifting his\\r\\neyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” muttered Sonia, “oh yes, it is,” she added, hastily, as though in\\r\\nthat lay her means of escape. “My landlady’s clock has just struck... I\\r\\nheard it myself....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve come to you for the last time,” Raskolnikov went on gloomily,\\r\\nalthough this was the first time. “I may perhaps not see you again...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you... going away?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know... to-morrow....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-morrow?” Sonia’s voice\\r\\nshook.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know. I shall know to-morrow morning.... Never mind that: I’ve\\r\\ncome to say one word....”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed that he was\\r\\nsitting down while she was all the while standing before him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why are you standing? Sit down,” he said in a changed voice, gentle and\\r\\nfriendly.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat down. He looked kindly and almost compassionately at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How thin you are! What a hand! Quite transparent, like a dead hand.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took her hand. Sonia smiled faintly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have always been like that,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Even when you lived at home?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course, you were,” he added abruptly and the expression of his face\\r\\nand the sound of his voice changed again suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked round him once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You rent this room from the Kapernaumovs?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They live there, through that door?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.... They have another room like this.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All in one room?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should be afraid in your room at night,” he observed gloomily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are very good people, very kind,” answered Sonia, who still seemed\\r\\nbewildered, “and all the furniture, everything... everything is theirs.\\r\\nAnd they are very kind and the children, too, often come to see me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They all stammer, don’t they?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.... He stammers and he’s lame. And his wife, too.... It’s not\\r\\nexactly that she stammers, but she can’t speak plainly. She is a very\\r\\nkind woman. And he used to be a house serf. And there are seven\\r\\nchildren... and it’s only the eldest one that stammers and the others\\r\\nare simply ill... but they don’t stammer.... But where did you hear\\r\\nabout them?” she added with some surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your father told me, then. He told me all about you.... And how you\\r\\nwent out at six o’clock and came back at nine and how Katerina Ivanovna\\r\\nknelt down by your bed.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia was confused.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I fancied I saw him to-day,” she whispered hesitatingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Whom?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Father. I was walking in the street, out there at the corner, about ten\\r\\no’clock and he seemed to be walking in front. It looked just like him. I\\r\\nwanted to go to Katerina Ivanovna....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You were walking in the streets?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” Sonia whispered abruptly, again overcome with confusion and\\r\\nlooking down.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Katerina Ivanovna used to beat you, I dare say?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh no, what are you saying? No!” Sonia looked at him almost with\\r\\ndismay.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You love her, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Love her? Of course!” said Sonia with plaintive emphasis, and she\\r\\nclasped her hands in distress. “Ah, you don’t.... If you only knew!\\r\\nYou see, she is quite like a child.... Her mind is quite unhinged, you\\r\\nsee... from sorrow. And how clever she used to be... how generous... how\\r\\nkind! Ah, you don’t understand, you don’t understand!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia said this as though in despair, wringing her hands in excitement\\r\\nand distress. Her pale cheeks flushed, there was a look of anguish in\\r\\nher eyes. It was clear that she was stirred to the very depths, that\\r\\nshe was longing to speak, to champion, to express something. A sort\\r\\nof _insatiable_ compassion, if one may so express it, was reflected in\\r\\nevery feature of her face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Beat me! how can you? Good heavens, beat me! And if she did beat me,\\r\\nwhat then? What of it? You know nothing, nothing about it.... She is so\\r\\nunhappy... ah, how unhappy! And ill.... She is seeking righteousness,\\r\\nshe is pure. She has such faith that there must be righteousness\\r\\neverywhere and she expects it.... And if you were to torture her, she\\r\\nwouldn’t do wrong. She doesn’t see that it’s impossible for people to\\r\\nbe righteous and she is angry at it. Like a child, like a child. She is\\r\\ngood!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what will happen to you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia looked at him inquiringly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are left on your hands, you see. They were all on your hands\\r\\nbefore, though.... And your father came to you to beg for drink. Well,\\r\\nhow will it be now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know,” Sonia articulated mournfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Will they stay there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know.... They are in debt for the lodging, but the landlady,\\r\\nI hear, said to-day that she wanted to get rid of them, and Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna says that she won’t stay another minute.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How is it she is so bold? She relies upon you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no, don’t talk like that.... We are one, we live like one.” Sonia\\r\\nwas agitated again and even angry, as though a canary or some other\\r\\nlittle bird were to be angry. “And what could she do? What, what could\\r\\nshe do?” she persisted, getting hot and excited. “And how she cried\\r\\nto-day! Her mind is unhinged, haven’t you noticed it? At one minute she\\r\\nis worrying like a child that everything should be right to-morrow, the\\r\\nlunch and all that.... Then she is wringing her hands, spitting blood,\\r\\nweeping, and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the\\r\\nwall, in despair. Then she will be comforted again. She builds all her\\r\\nhopes on you; she says that you will help her now and that she will\\r\\nborrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and\\r\\nset up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to\\r\\nsuperintend it, and we will begin a new splendid life. And she kisses\\r\\nand hugs me, comforts me, and you know she has such faith, such faith in\\r\\nher fancies! One can’t contradict her. And all the day long she has been\\r\\nwashing, cleaning, mending. She dragged the wash tub into the room with\\r\\nher feeble hands and sank on the bed, gasping for breath. We went this\\r\\nmorning to the shops to buy shoes for Polenka and Lida for theirs are\\r\\nquite worn out. Only the money we’d reckoned wasn’t enough, not nearly\\r\\nenough. And she picked out such dear little boots, for she has taste,\\r\\nyou don’t know. And there in the shop she burst out crying before the\\r\\nshopmen because she hadn’t enough.... Ah, it was sad to see her....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, after that I can understand your living like this,” Raskolnikov\\r\\nsaid with a bitter smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And aren’t you sorry for them? Aren’t you sorry?” Sonia flew at him\\r\\nagain. “Why, I know, you gave your last penny yourself, though you’d\\r\\nseen nothing of it, and if you’d seen everything, oh dear! And how\\r\\noften, how often I’ve brought her to tears! Only last week! Yes, I! Only\\r\\na week before his death. I was cruel! And how often I’ve done it! Ah,\\r\\nI’ve been wretched at the thought of it all day!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of remembering it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You were cruel?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I--I. I went to see them,” she went on, weeping, “and father said,\\r\\n‘read me something, Sonia, my head aches, read to me, here’s a book.’ He\\r\\nhad a book he had got from Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he lives\\r\\nthere, he always used to get hold of such funny books. And I said, ‘I\\r\\ncan’t stay,’ as I didn’t want to read, and I’d gone in chiefly to show\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna some collars. Lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me some\\r\\ncollars and cuffs cheap, pretty, new, embroidered ones. Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna liked them very much; she put them on and looked at herself\\r\\nin the glass and was delighted with them. ‘Make me a present of them,\\r\\nSonia,’ she said, ‘please do.’ ‘_Please do_,’ she said, she wanted them\\r\\nso much. And when could she wear them? They just reminded her of her old\\r\\nhappy days. She looked at herself in the glass, admired herself, and she\\r\\nhas no clothes at all, no things of her own, hasn’t had all these years!\\r\\nAnd she never asks anyone for anything; she is proud, she’d sooner give\\r\\naway everything. And these she asked for, she liked them so much. And I\\r\\nwas sorry to give them. ‘What use are they to you, Katerina Ivanovna?’ I\\r\\nsaid. I spoke like that to her, I ought not to have said that! She gave\\r\\nme such a look. And she was so grieved, so grieved at my refusing her.\\r\\nAnd it was so sad to see.... And she was not grieved for the collars,\\r\\nbut for my refusing, I saw that. Ah, if only I could bring it all back,\\r\\nchange it, take back those words! Ah, if I... but it’s nothing to you!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you know Lizaveta, the pedlar?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.... Did you know her?” Sonia asked with some surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Katerina Ivanovna is in consumption, rapid consumption; she will soon\\r\\ndie,” said Raskolnikov after a pause, without answering her question.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no, no, no!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Sonia unconsciously clutched both his hands, as though imploring\\r\\nthat she should not.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it will be better if she does die.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, not better, not at all better!” Sonia unconsciously repeated in\\r\\ndismay.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the children? What can you do except take them to live with you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I don’t know,” cried Sonia, almost in despair, and she put her\\r\\nhands to her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was evident that that idea had very often occurred to her before and\\r\\nhe had only roused it again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And, what, if even now, while Katerina Ivanovna is alive, you get ill\\r\\nand are taken to the hospital, what will happen then?” he persisted\\r\\npitilessly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How can you? That cannot be!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Sonia’s face worked with awful terror.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Cannot be?” Raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile. “You are not\\r\\ninsured against it, are you? What will happen to them then? They will\\r\\nbe in the street, all of them, she will cough and beg and knock her head\\r\\nagainst some wall, as she did to-day, and the children will cry....\\r\\nThen she will fall down, be taken to the police station and to the\\r\\nhospital, she will die, and the children...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no.... God will not let it be!” broke at last from Sonia’s\\r\\noverburdened bosom.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe listened, looking imploringly at him, clasping her hands in dumb\\r\\nentreaty, as though it all depended upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room. A minute passed.\\r\\nSonia was standing with her hands and her head hanging in terrible\\r\\ndejection.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And can’t you save? Put by for a rainy day?” he asked, stopping\\r\\nsuddenly before her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” whispered Sonia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course not. Have you tried?” he added almost ironically.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And it didn’t come off! Of course not! No need to ask.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd again he paced the room. Another minute passed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t get money every day?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” she whispered with a painful effort.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It will be the same with Polenka, no doubt,” he said suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no! It can’t be, no!” Sonia cried aloud in desperation, as though\\r\\nshe had been stabbed. “God would not allow anything so awful!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He lets others come to it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no! God will protect her, God!” she repeated beside herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But, perhaps, there is no God at all,” Raskolnikov answered with a sort\\r\\nof malignance, laughed and looked at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia’s face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it. She looked at\\r\\nhim with unutterable reproach, tried to say something, but could not\\r\\nspeak and broke into bitter, bitter sobs, hiding her face in her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You say Katerina Ivanovna’s mind is unhinged; your own mind is\\r\\nunhinged,” he said after a brief silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive minutes passed. He still paced up and down the room in silence, not\\r\\nlooking at her. At last he went up to her; his eyes glittered. He put\\r\\nhis two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful\\r\\nface. His eyes were hard, feverish and piercing, his lips were\\r\\ntwitching. All at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the\\r\\nground, kissed her foot. Sonia drew back from him as from a madman. And\\r\\ncertainly he looked like a madman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you doing to me?” she muttered, turning pale, and a sudden\\r\\nanguish clutched at her heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood up at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of\\r\\nhumanity,” he said wildly and walked away to the window. “Listen,” he\\r\\nadded, turning to her a minute later. “I said just now to an insolent\\r\\nman that he was not worth your little finger... and that I did my sister\\r\\nhonour making her sit beside you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ach, you said that to them! And in her presence?” cried Sonia,\\r\\nfrightened. “Sit down with me! An honour! Why, I’m... dishonourable....\\r\\nAh, why did you say that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said that of you,\\r\\nbut because of your great suffering. But you are a great sinner, that’s\\r\\ntrue,” he added almost solemnly, “and your worst sin is that you have\\r\\ndestroyed and betrayed yourself _for nothing_. Isn’t that fearful? Isn’t\\r\\nit fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so, and at\\r\\nthe same time you know yourself (you’ve only to open your eyes) that you\\r\\nare not helping anyone by it, not saving anyone from anything? Tell me,”\\r\\n he went on almost in a frenzy, “how this shame and degradation can exist\\r\\nin you side by side with other, opposite, holy feelings? It would be\\r\\nbetter, a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and end\\r\\nit all!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what would become of them?” Sonia asked faintly, gazing at him with\\r\\neyes of anguish, but not seeming surprised at his suggestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov looked strangely at her. He read it all in her face; so she\\r\\nmust have had that thought already, perhaps many times, and earnestly\\r\\nshe had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly, that\\r\\nnow she scarcely wondered at his suggestion. She had not even noticed\\r\\nthe cruelty of his words. (The significance of his reproaches and his\\r\\npeculiar attitude to her shame she had, of course, not noticed either,\\r\\nand that, too, was clear to him.) But he saw how monstrously the thought\\r\\nof her disgraceful, shameful position was torturing her and had long\\r\\ntortured her. “What, what,” he thought, “could hitherto have hindered\\r\\nher from putting an end to it?” Only then he realised what those poor\\r\\nlittle orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna,\\r\\nknocking her head against the wall in her consumption, meant for Sonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her character and\\r\\nthe amount of education she had after all received, she could not in any\\r\\ncase remain so. He was still confronted by the question, how could she\\r\\nhave remained so long in that position without going out of her mind,\\r\\nsince she could not bring herself to jump into the water? Of course he\\r\\nknew that Sonia’s position was an exceptional case, though unhappily not\\r\\nunique and not infrequent, indeed; but that very exceptionalness, her\\r\\ntinge of education, her previous life might, one would have thought,\\r\\nhave killed her at the first step on that revolting path. What held her\\r\\nup--surely not depravity? All that infamy had obviously only touched\\r\\nher mechanically, not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her\\r\\nheart; he saw that. He saw through her as she stood before him....\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are three ways before her,” he thought, “the canal, the madhouse,\\r\\nor... at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns\\r\\nthe heart to stone.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last idea was the most revolting, but he was a sceptic, he was\\r\\nyoung, abstract, and therefore cruel, and so he could not help believing\\r\\nthat the last end was the most likely.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But can that be true?” he cried to himself. “Can that creature who has\\r\\nstill preserved the purity of her spirit be consciously drawn at last\\r\\ninto that sink of filth and iniquity? Can the process already have\\r\\nbegun? Can it be that she has only been able to bear it till now,\\r\\nbecause vice has begun to be less loathsome to her? No, no, that cannot\\r\\nbe!” he cried, as Sonia had just before. “No, what has kept her from the\\r\\ncanal till now is the idea of sin and they, the children.... And if she\\r\\nhas not gone out of her mind... but who says she has not gone out of her\\r\\nmind? Is she in her senses? Can one talk, can one reason as she does?\\r\\nHow can she sit on the edge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which she\\r\\nis slipping and refuse to listen when she is told of danger? Does she\\r\\nexpect a miracle? No doubt she does. Doesn’t that all mean madness?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stayed obstinately at that thought. He liked that explanation indeed\\r\\nbetter than any other. He began looking more intently at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So you pray to God a great deal, Sonia?” he asked her.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia did not speak; he stood beside her waiting for an answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What should I be without God?” she whispered rapidly, forcibly,\\r\\nglancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes, and squeezing his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, so that is it!” he thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what does God do for you?” he asked, probing her further.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia was silent a long while, as though she could not answer. Her weak\\r\\nchest kept heaving with emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Be silent! Don’t ask! You don’t deserve!” she cried suddenly, looking\\r\\nsternly and wrathfully at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s it, that’s it,” he repeated to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He does everything,” she whispered quickly, looking down again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s the way out! That’s the explanation,” he decided, scrutinising\\r\\nher with eager curiosity, with a new, strange, almost morbid feeling.\\r\\nHe gazed at that pale, thin, irregular, angular little face, those soft\\r\\nblue eyes, which could flash with such fire, such stern energy, that\\r\\nlittle body still shaking with indignation and anger--and it all seemed\\r\\nto him more and more strange, almost impossible. “She is a religious\\r\\nmaniac!” he repeated to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a book lying on the chest of drawers. He had noticed it every\\r\\ntime he paced up and down the room. Now he took it up and looked at it.\\r\\nIt was the New Testament in the Russian translation. It was bound in\\r\\nleather, old and worn.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where did you get that?” he called to her across the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was still standing in the same place, three steps from the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was brought me,” she answered, as it were unwillingly, not looking\\r\\nat him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who brought it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lizaveta, I asked her for it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lizaveta! strange!” he thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything about Sonia seemed to him stranger and more wonderful every\\r\\nmoment. He carried the book to the candle and began to turn over the\\r\\npages.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where is the story of Lazarus?” he asked suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia looked obstinately at the ground and would not answer. She was\\r\\nstanding sideways to the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where is the raising of Lazarus? Find it for me, Sonia.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stole a glance at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are not looking in the right place.... It’s in the fourth gospel,”\\r\\n she whispered sternly, without looking at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Find it and read it to me,” he said. He sat down with his elbow on the\\r\\ntable, leaned his head on his hand and looked away sullenly, prepared to\\r\\nlisten.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In three weeks’ time they’ll welcome me in the madhouse! I shall be\\r\\nthere if I am not in a worse place,” he muttered to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia heard Raskolnikov’s request distrustfully and moved hesitatingly\\r\\nto the table. She took the book however.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Haven’t you read it?” she asked, looking up at him across the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer voice became sterner and sterner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Long ago.... When I was at school. Read!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And haven’t you heard it in church?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I... haven’t been. Do you often go?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“N-no,” whispered Sonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I understand.... And you won’t go to your father’s funeral to-morrow?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I shall. I was at church last week, too... I had a requiem\\r\\nservice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“For whom?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“For Lizaveta. She was killed with an axe.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis nerves were more and more strained. His head began to go round.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Were you friends with Lizaveta?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.... She was good... she used to come... not often... she\\r\\ncouldn’t.... We used to read together and... talk. She will see God.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last phrase sounded strange in his ears. And here was something new\\r\\nagain: the mysterious meetings with Lizaveta and both of them--religious\\r\\nmaniacs.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall be a religious maniac myself soon! It’s infectious!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Read!” he cried irritably and insistently.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia still hesitated. Her heart was throbbing. She hardly dared to read\\r\\nto him. He looked almost with exasperation at the “unhappy lunatic.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What for? You don’t believe?...” she whispered softly and as it were\\r\\nbreathlessly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Read! I want you to,” he persisted. “You used to read to Lizaveta.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia opened the book and found the place. Her hands were shaking, her\\r\\nvoice failed her. Twice she tried to begin and could not bring out the\\r\\nfirst syllable.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany...” she forced\\r\\nherself at last to read, but at the third word her voice broke like an\\r\\noverstrained string. There was a catch in her breath.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring herself to read to him\\r\\nand the more he saw this, the more roughly and irritably he insisted on\\r\\nher doing so. He understood only too well how painful it was for her\\r\\nto betray and unveil all that was her _own_. He understood that these\\r\\nfeelings really were her _secret treasure_, which she had kept perhaps\\r\\nfor years, perhaps from childhood, while she lived with an unhappy\\r\\nfather and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief, in the midst of\\r\\nstarving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches. But at the same\\r\\ntime he knew now and knew for certain that, although it filled her with\\r\\ndread and suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read\\r\\nto _him_ that he might hear it, and to read _now_ whatever might come of\\r\\nit!... He read this in her eyes, he could see it in her intense emotion.\\r\\nShe mastered herself, controlled the spasm in her throat and went on\\r\\nreading the eleventh chapter of St. John. She went on to the nineteenth\\r\\nverse:\\r\\n\\r\\n“And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning\\r\\ntheir brother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met\\r\\nHim: but Mary sat still in the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother\\r\\nhad not died.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I know that even now whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give\\r\\nit Thee....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that her voice would\\r\\nquiver and break again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Jesus said unto her, thy brother shall rise again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again in the\\r\\nresurrection, at the last day.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that\\r\\nbelieveth in Me though he were dead, yet shall he live.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest\\r\\nthou this?\\r\\n\\r\\n“She saith unto Him,”\\r\\n\\r\\n(And drawing a painful breath, Sonia read distinctly and forcibly as\\r\\nthough she were making a public confession of faith.)\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yea, Lord: I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God Which\\r\\nshould come into the world.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stopped and looked up quickly at him, but controlling herself went\\r\\non reading. Raskolnikov sat without moving, his elbows on the table and\\r\\nhis eyes turned away. She read to the thirty-second verse.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell down at\\r\\nHis feet, saying unto Him, Lord if Thou hadst been here, my brother had\\r\\nnot died.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which\\r\\ncame with her, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled,\\r\\n\\r\\n“And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto Him, Lord, come and\\r\\nsee.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Jesus wept.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then said the Jews, behold how He loved him!\\r\\n\\r\\n“And some of them said, could not this Man which opened the eyes of the\\r\\nblind, have caused that even this man should not have died?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion. Yes, he had known it!\\r\\nShe was trembling in a real physical fever. He had expected it. She was\\r\\ngetting near the story of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense\\r\\ntriumph came over her. Her voice rang out like a bell; triumph and joy\\r\\ngave it power. The lines danced before her eyes, but she knew what she\\r\\nwas reading by heart. At the last verse “Could not this Man which opened\\r\\nthe eyes of the blind...” dropping her voice she passionately reproduced\\r\\nthe doubt, the reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving Jews, who\\r\\nin another moment would fall at His feet as though struck by\\r\\nthunder, sobbing and believing.... “And _he, he_--too, is blinded and\\r\\nunbelieving, he, too, will hear, he, too, will believe, yes, yes! At\\r\\nonce, now,” was what she was dreaming, and she was quivering with happy\\r\\nanticipation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the grave. It was a\\r\\ncave, and a stone lay upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was\\r\\ndead, saith unto Him, Lord by this time he stinketh: for he hath been\\r\\ndead four days.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laid emphasis on the word _four_.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest\\r\\nbelieve, thou shouldest see the glory of God?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid.\\r\\nAnd Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank Thee that Thou\\r\\nhast heard Me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And I knew that Thou hearest Me always; but because of the people which\\r\\nstand by I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come\\r\\nforth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And he that was dead came forth.”\\r\\n\\r\\n(She read loudly, cold and trembling with ecstasy, as though she were\\r\\nseeing it before her eyes.)\\r\\n\\r\\n“Bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was bound about\\r\\nwith a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him and let him go.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the things which\\r\\nJesus did believed on Him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could read no more, closed the book and got up from her chair\\r\\nquickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is all about the raising of Lazarus,” she whispered severely and\\r\\nabruptly, and turning away she stood motionless, not daring to raise\\r\\nher eyes to him. She still trembled feverishly. The candle-end was\\r\\nflickering out in the battered candlestick, dimly lighting up in the\\r\\npoverty-stricken room the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely\\r\\nbeen reading together the eternal book. Five minutes or more passed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I came to speak of something,” Raskolnikov said aloud, frowning. He got\\r\\nup and went to Sonia. She lifted her eyes to him in silence. His face\\r\\nwas particularly stern and there was a sort of savage determination in\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have abandoned my family to-day,” he said, “my mother and sister. I\\r\\nam not going to see them. I’ve broken with them completely.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What for?” asked Sonia amazed. Her recent meeting with his mother and\\r\\nsister had left a great impression which she could not analyse. She\\r\\nheard his news almost with horror.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have only you now,” he added. “Let us go together.... I’ve come to\\r\\nyou, we are both accursed, let us go our way together!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis eyes glittered “as though he were mad,” Sonia thought, in her turn.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go where?” she asked in alarm and she involuntarily stepped back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do I know? I only know it’s the same road, I know that and nothing\\r\\nmore. It’s the same goal!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him and understood nothing. She knew only that he was\\r\\nterribly, infinitely unhappy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No one of them will understand, if you tell them, but I have\\r\\nunderstood. I need you, that is why I have come to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t understand,” whispered Sonia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll understand later. Haven’t you done the same? You, too, have\\r\\ntransgressed... have had the strength to transgress. You have laid\\r\\nhands on yourself, you have destroyed a life... _your own_ (it’s all the\\r\\nsame!). You might have lived in spirit and understanding, but you’ll\\r\\nend in the Hay Market.... But you won’t be able to stand it, and if\\r\\nyou remain alone you’ll go out of your mind like me. You are like a mad\\r\\ncreature already. So we must go together on the same road! Let us go!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What for? What’s all this for?” said Sonia, strangely and violently\\r\\nagitated by his words.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What for? Because you can’t remain like this, that’s why! You must look\\r\\nthings straight in the face at last, and not weep like a child and cry\\r\\nthat God won’t allow it. What will happen, if you should really be taken\\r\\nto the hospital to-morrow? She is mad and in consumption, she’ll soon\\r\\ndie and the children? Do you mean to tell me Polenka won’t come to\\r\\ngrief? Haven’t you seen children here at the street corners sent out\\r\\nby their mothers to beg? I’ve found out where those mothers live and in\\r\\nwhat surroundings. Children can’t remain children there! At seven the\\r\\nchild is vicious and a thief. Yet children, you know, are the image of\\r\\nChrist: ‘theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.’ He bade us honour and love\\r\\nthem, they are the humanity of the future....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s to be done, what’s to be done?” repeated Sonia, weeping\\r\\nhysterically and wringing her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s to be done? Break what must be broken, once for all, that’s all,\\r\\nand take the suffering on oneself. What, you don’t understand? You’ll\\r\\nunderstand later.... Freedom and power, and above all, power! Over all\\r\\ntrembling creation and all the ant-heap!... That’s the goal, remember\\r\\nthat! That’s my farewell message. Perhaps it’s the last time I shall\\r\\nspeak to you. If I don’t come to-morrow, you’ll hear of it all, and then\\r\\nremember these words. And some day later on, in years to come, you’ll\\r\\nunderstand perhaps what they meant. If I come to-morrow, I’ll tell you\\r\\nwho killed Lizaveta.... Good-bye.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia started with terror.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, do you know who killed her?” she asked, chilled with horror,\\r\\nlooking wildly at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know and will tell... you, only you. I have chosen you out. I’m not\\r\\ncoming to you to ask forgiveness, but simply to tell you. I chose you\\r\\nout long ago to hear this, when your father talked of you and when\\r\\nLizaveta was alive, I thought of it. Good-bye, don’t shake hands.\\r\\nTo-morrow!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went out. Sonia gazed at him as at a madman. But she herself was like\\r\\none insane and felt it. Her head was going round.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens, how does he know who killed Lizaveta? What did those\\r\\nwords mean? It’s awful!” But at the same time _the idea_ did not enter\\r\\nher head, not for a moment! “Oh, he must be terribly unhappy!... He has\\r\\nabandoned his mother and sister.... What for? What has happened? And\\r\\nwhat had he in his mind? What did he say to her? He had kissed her foot\\r\\nand said... said (yes, he had said it clearly) that he could not live\\r\\nwithout her.... Oh, merciful heavens!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious. She jumped up from\\r\\ntime to time, wept and wrung her hands, then sank again into feverish\\r\\nsleep and dreamt of Polenka, Katerina Ivanovna and Lizaveta, of reading\\r\\nthe gospel and him... him with pale face, with burning eyes... kissing\\r\\nher feet, weeping.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other side of the door on the right, which divided Sonia’s room\\r\\nfrom Madame Resslich’s flat, was a room which had long stood empty. A\\r\\ncard was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over the\\r\\ncanal advertising it to let. Sonia had long been accustomed to the\\r\\nroom’s being uninhabited. But all that time Mr. Svidrigaïlov had been\\r\\nstanding, listening at the door of the empty room. When Raskolnikov went\\r\\nout he stood still, thought a moment, went on tiptoe to his own room\\r\\nwhich adjoined the empty one, brought a chair and noiselessly carried it\\r\\nto the door that led to Sonia’s room. The conversation had struck him\\r\\nas interesting and remarkable, and he had greatly enjoyed it--so much so\\r\\nthat he brought a chair that he might not in the future, to-morrow, for\\r\\ninstance, have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour, but\\r\\nmight listen in comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen next morning at eleven o’clock punctually Raskolnikov went into the\\r\\ndepartment of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his name in\\r\\nto Porfiry Petrovitch, he was surprised at being kept waiting so long:\\r\\nit was at least ten minutes before he was summoned. He had expected\\r\\nthat they would pounce upon him. But he stood in the waiting-room, and\\r\\npeople, who apparently had nothing to do with him, were continually\\r\\npassing to and fro before him. In the next room which looked like an\\r\\noffice, several clerks were sitting writing and obviously they had\\r\\nno notion who or what Raskolnikov might be. He looked uneasily and\\r\\nsuspiciously about him to see whether there was not some guard, some\\r\\nmysterious watch being kept on him to prevent his escape. But there was\\r\\nnothing of the sort: he saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty\\r\\ndetails, then other people, no one seemed to have any concern with him.\\r\\nHe might go where he liked for them. The conviction grew stronger in him\\r\\nthat if that enigmatic man of yesterday, that phantom sprung out of the\\r\\nearth, had seen everything, they would not have let him stand and wait\\r\\nlike that. And would they have waited till he elected to appear at\\r\\neleven? Either the man had not yet given information, or... or simply\\r\\nhe knew nothing, had seen nothing (and how could he have seen anything?)\\r\\nand so all that had happened to him the day before was again a phantom\\r\\nexaggerated by his sick and overstrained imagination. This conjecture\\r\\nhad begun to grow strong the day before, in the midst of all his\\r\\nalarm and despair. Thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh\\r\\nconflict, he was suddenly aware that he was trembling--and he felt a\\r\\nrush of indignation at the thought that he was trembling with fear at\\r\\nfacing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch. What he dreaded above all was\\r\\nmeeting that man again; he hated him with an intense, unmitigated hatred\\r\\nand was afraid his hatred might betray him. His indignation was such\\r\\nthat he ceased trembling at once; he made ready to go in with a cold and\\r\\narrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep as silent as possible,\\r\\nto watch and listen and for once at least to control his overstrained\\r\\nnerves. At that moment he was summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his study. His study was a room\\r\\nneither large nor small, furnished with a large writing-table, that\\r\\nstood before a sofa, upholstered in checked material, a bureau, a\\r\\nbookcase in the corner and several chairs--all government furniture,\\r\\nof polished yellow wood. In the further wall there was a closed door,\\r\\nbeyond it there were no doubt other rooms. On Raskolnikov’s entrance\\r\\nPorfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by which he had come in\\r\\nand they remained alone. He met his visitor with an apparently genial\\r\\nand good-tempered air, and it was only after a few minutes that\\r\\nRaskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him, as though he had\\r\\nbeen thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, my dear fellow! Here you are... in our domain”... began Porfiry,\\r\\nholding out both hands to him. “Come, sit down, old man... or perhaps\\r\\nyou don’t like to be called ‘my dear fellow’ and ‘old man!’--_tout\\r\\ncourt_? Please don’t think it too familiar.... Here, on the sofa.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov sat down, keeping his eyes fixed on him. “In our domain,”\\r\\n the apologies for familiarity, the French phrase _tout court_, were all\\r\\ncharacteristic signs.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He held out both hands to me, but he did not give me one--he drew it\\r\\nback in time,” struck him suspiciously. Both were watching each other,\\r\\nbut when their eyes met, quick as lightning they looked away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I brought you this paper... about the watch. Here it is. Is it all\\r\\nright or shall I copy it again?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What? A paper? Yes, yes, don’t be uneasy, it’s all right,” Porfiry\\r\\nPetrovitch said as though in haste, and after he had said it he took the\\r\\npaper and looked at it. “Yes, it’s all right. Nothing more is needed,”\\r\\n he declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nA minute later when he was talking of something else he took it from the\\r\\ntable and put it on his bureau.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I believe you said yesterday you would like to question me...\\r\\nformally... about my acquaintance with the murdered woman?” Raskolnikov\\r\\nwas beginning again. “Why did I put in ‘I believe’” passed through\\r\\nhis mind in a flash. “Why am I so uneasy at having put in that ‘_I\\r\\nbelieve_’?” came in a second flash. And he suddenly felt that his\\r\\nuneasiness at the mere contact with Porfiry, at the first words, at the\\r\\nfirst looks, had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions, and that\\r\\nthis was fearfully dangerous. His nerves were quivering, his emotion was\\r\\nincreasing. “It’s bad, it’s bad! I shall say too much again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes, yes! There’s no hurry, there’s no hurry,” muttered Porfiry\\r\\nPetrovitch, moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim,\\r\\nas it were making dashes towards the window, the bureau and the table,\\r\\nat one moment avoiding Raskolnikov’s suspicious glance, then again\\r\\nstanding still and looking him straight in the face.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis fat round little figure looked very strange, like a ball rolling\\r\\nfrom one side to the other and rebounding back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ve plenty of time. Do you smoke? have you your own? Here, a\\r\\ncigarette!” he went on, offering his visitor a cigarette. “You know I am\\r\\nreceiving you here, but my own quarters are through there, you know, my\\r\\ngovernment quarters. But I am living outside for the time, I had to\\r\\nhave some repairs done here. It’s almost finished now.... Government\\r\\nquarters, you know, are a capital thing. Eh, what do you think?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, a capital thing,” answered Raskolnikov, looking at him almost\\r\\nironically.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A capital thing, a capital thing,” repeated Porfiry Petrovitch, as\\r\\nthough he had just thought of something quite different. “Yes, a capital\\r\\nthing,” he almost shouted at last, suddenly staring at Raskolnikov and\\r\\nstopping short two steps from him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the\\r\\nserious, brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this stirred Raskolnikov’s spleen more than ever and he could not\\r\\nresist an ironical and rather incautious challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell me, please,” he asked suddenly, looking almost insolently at him\\r\\nand taking a kind of pleasure in his own insolence. “I believe it’s a\\r\\nsort of legal rule, a sort of legal tradition--for all investigating\\r\\nlawyers--to begin their attack from afar, with a trivial, or at least\\r\\nan irrelevant subject, so as to encourage, or rather, to divert the man\\r\\nthey are cross-examining, to disarm his caution and then all at once to\\r\\ngive him an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal question. Isn’t\\r\\nthat so? It’s a sacred tradition, mentioned, I fancy, in all the manuals\\r\\nof the art?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes.... Why, do you imagine that was why I spoke about government\\r\\nquarters... eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his eyes and winked;\\r\\na good-humoured, crafty look passed over his face. The wrinkles on his\\r\\nforehead were smoothed out, his eyes contracted, his features broadened\\r\\nand he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh, shaking all\\r\\nover and looking Raskolnikov straight in the face. The latter forced\\r\\nhimself to laugh, too, but when Porfiry, seeing that he was laughing,\\r\\nbroke into such a guffaw that he turned almost crimson, Raskolnikov’s\\r\\nrepulsion overcame all precaution; he left off laughing, scowled and\\r\\nstared with hatred at Porfiry, keeping his eyes fixed on him while his\\r\\nintentionally prolonged laughter lasted. There was lack of precaution on\\r\\nboth sides, however, for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be laughing in\\r\\nhis visitor’s face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with\\r\\nwhich the visitor received it. The latter fact was very significant\\r\\nin Raskolnikov’s eyes: he saw that Porfiry Petrovitch had not been\\r\\nembarrassed just before either, but that he, Raskolnikov, had perhaps\\r\\nfallen into a trap; that there must be something, some motive here\\r\\nunknown to him; that, perhaps, everything was in readiness and in\\r\\nanother moment would break upon him...\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went straight to the point at once, rose from his seat and took his\\r\\ncap.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Porfiry Petrovitch,” he began resolutely, though with considerable\\r\\nirritation, “yesterday you expressed a desire that I should come to you\\r\\nfor some inquiries” (he laid special stress on the word “inquiries”). “I\\r\\nhave come and if you have anything to ask me, ask it, and if not, allow\\r\\nme to withdraw. I have no time to spare.... I have to be at the funeral\\r\\nof that man who was run over, of whom you... know also,” he added,\\r\\nfeeling angry at once at having made this addition and more irritated at\\r\\nhis anger. “I am sick of it all, do you hear? and have long been. It’s\\r\\npartly what made me ill. In short,” he shouted, feeling that the phrase\\r\\nabout his illness was still more out of place, “in short, kindly examine\\r\\nme or let me go, at once. And if you must examine me, do so in the\\r\\nproper form! I will not allow you to do so otherwise, and so meanwhile,\\r\\ngood-bye, as we have evidently nothing to keep us now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens! What do you mean? What shall I question you about?”\\r\\n cackled Porfiry Petrovitch with a change of tone, instantly leaving off\\r\\nlaughing. “Please don’t disturb yourself,” he began fidgeting from place\\r\\nto place and fussily making Raskolnikov sit down. “There’s no hurry,\\r\\nthere’s no hurry, it’s all nonsense. Oh, no, I’m very glad you’ve come\\r\\nto see me at last... I look upon you simply as a visitor. And as for\\r\\nmy confounded laughter, please excuse it, Rodion Romanovitch. Rodion\\r\\nRomanovitch? That is your name?... It’s my nerves, you tickled me\\r\\nso with your witty observation; I assure you, sometimes I shake with\\r\\nlaughter like an india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time.... I’m\\r\\noften afraid of an attack of paralysis. Do sit down. Please do, or I\\r\\nshall think you are angry...”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov did not speak; he listened, watching him, still frowning\\r\\nangrily. He did sit down, but still held his cap.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must tell you one thing about myself, my dear Rodion Romanovitch,”\\r\\n Porfiry Petrovitch continued, moving about the room and again avoiding\\r\\nhis visitor’s eyes. “You see, I’m a bachelor, a man of no consequence\\r\\nand not used to society; besides, I have nothing before me, I’m set, I’m\\r\\nrunning to seed and... and have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that in\\r\\nour Petersburg circles, if two clever men meet who are not intimate, but\\r\\nrespect each other, like you and me, it takes them half an hour before\\r\\nthey can find a subject for conversation--they are dumb, they sit\\r\\nopposite each other and feel awkward. Everyone has subjects of\\r\\nconversation, ladies for instance... people in high society always have\\r\\ntheir subjects of conversation, _c’est de rigueur_, but people of the\\r\\nmiddle sort like us, thinking people that is, are always tongue-tied\\r\\nand awkward. What is the reason of it? Whether it is the lack of public\\r\\ninterest, or whether it is we are so honest we don’t want to deceive one\\r\\nanother, I don’t know. What do you think? Do put down your cap, it\\r\\nlooks as if you were just going, it makes me uncomfortable... I am so\\r\\ndelighted...”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening in silence with\\r\\na serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of Porfiry\\r\\nPetrovitch. “Does he really want to distract my attention with his silly\\r\\nbabble?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t offer you coffee here; but why not spend five minutes with a\\r\\nfriend?” Porfiry pattered on, “and you know all these official\\r\\nduties... please don’t mind my running up and down, excuse it, my dear\\r\\nfellow, I am very much afraid of offending you, but exercise is\\r\\nabsolutely indispensable for me. I’m always sitting and so glad to be\\r\\nmoving about for five minutes... I suffer from my sedentary life... I\\r\\nalways intend to join a gymnasium; they say that officials of all ranks,\\r\\neven Privy Councillors, may be seen skipping gaily there; there you have\\r\\nit, modern science... yes, yes.... But as for my duties here, inquiries\\r\\nand all such formalities... you mentioned inquiries yourself just now...\\r\\nI assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for\\r\\nthe interrogator than for the interrogated.... You made the observation\\r\\nyourself just now very aptly and wittily.” (Raskolnikov had made no\\r\\nobservation of the kind.) “One gets into a muddle! A regular muddle! One\\r\\nkeeps harping on the same note, like a drum! There is to be a reform and\\r\\nwe shall be called by a different name, at least, he-he-he! And as for\\r\\nour legal tradition, as you so wittily called it, I thoroughly agree\\r\\nwith you. Every prisoner on trial, even the rudest peasant, knows that\\r\\nthey begin by disarming him with irrelevant questions (as you so happily\\r\\nput it) and then deal him a knock-down blow, he-he-he!--your felicitous\\r\\ncomparison, he-he! So you really imagined that I meant by ‘government\\r\\nquarters’... he-he! You are an ironical person. Come. I won’t go on! Ah,\\r\\nby the way, yes! One word leads to another. You spoke of formality just\\r\\nnow, apropos of the inquiry, you know. But what’s the use of formality?\\r\\nIn many cases it’s nonsense. Sometimes one has a friendly chat and gets\\r\\na good deal more out of it. One can always fall back on formality, allow\\r\\nme to assure you. And after all, what does it amount to? An examining\\r\\nlawyer cannot be bounded by formality at every step. The work of\\r\\ninvestigation is, so to speak, a free art in its own way, he-he-he!”\\r\\n\\r\\nPorfiry Petrovitch took breath a moment. He had simply babbled on\\r\\nuttering empty phrases, letting slip a few enigmatic words and again\\r\\nreverting to incoherence. He was almost running about the room, moving\\r\\nhis fat little legs quicker and quicker, looking at the ground, with his\\r\\nright hand behind his back, while with his left making gesticulations\\r\\nthat were extraordinarily incongruous with his words. Raskolnikov\\r\\nsuddenly noticed that as he ran about the room he seemed twice to stop\\r\\nfor a moment near the door, as though he were listening.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is he expecting anything?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are certainly quite right about it,” Porfiry began gaily, looking\\r\\nwith extraordinary simplicity at Raskolnikov (which startled him and\\r\\ninstantly put him on his guard); “certainly quite right in laughing so\\r\\nwittily at our legal forms, he-he! Some of these elaborate psychological\\r\\nmethods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless, if one adheres\\r\\ntoo closely to the forms. Yes... I am talking of forms again. Well, if\\r\\nI recognise, or more strictly speaking, if I suspect someone or other to\\r\\nbe a criminal in any case entrusted to me... you’re reading for the law,\\r\\nof course, Rodion Romanovitch?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I was...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, then it is a precedent for you for the future--though don’t\\r\\nsuppose I should venture to instruct you after the articles you publish\\r\\nabout crime! No, I simply make bold to state it by way of fact, if I\\r\\ntook this man or that for a criminal, why, I ask, should I worry him\\r\\nprematurely, even though I had evidence against him? In one case I may\\r\\nbe bound, for instance, to arrest a man at once, but another may be in\\r\\nquite a different position, you know, so why shouldn’t I let him walk\\r\\nabout the town a bit? he-he-he! But I see you don’t quite understand, so\\r\\nI’ll give you a clearer example. If I put him in prison too soon, I\\r\\nmay very likely give him, so to speak, moral support, he-he! You’re\\r\\nlaughing?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov had no idea of laughing. He was sitting with compressed\\r\\nlips, his feverish eyes fixed on Porfiry Petrovitch’s.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yet that is the case, with some types especially, for men are so\\r\\ndifferent. You say ‘evidence’. Well, there may be evidence. But\\r\\nevidence, you know, can generally be taken two ways. I am an examining\\r\\nlawyer and a weak man, I confess it. I should like to make a proof, so\\r\\nto say, mathematically clear. I should like to make a chain of evidence\\r\\nsuch as twice two are four, it ought to be a direct, irrefutable proof!\\r\\nAnd if I shut him up too soon--even though I might be convinced _he_\\r\\nwas the man, I should very likely be depriving myself of the means of\\r\\ngetting further evidence against him. And how? By giving him, so to\\r\\nspeak, a definite position, I shall put him out of suspense and set his\\r\\nmind at rest, so that he will retreat into his shell. They say that at\\r\\nSevastopol, soon after Alma, the clever people were in a terrible fright\\r\\nthat the enemy would attack openly and take Sevastopol at once. But when\\r\\nthey saw that the enemy preferred a regular siege, they were delighted,\\r\\nI am told and reassured, for the thing would drag on for two months at\\r\\nleast. You’re laughing, you don’t believe me again? Of course, you’re\\r\\nright, too. You’re right, you’re right. These are special cases, I\\r\\nadmit. But you must observe this, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, the\\r\\ngeneral case, the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended,\\r\\nfor which they are calculated and laid down in books, does not exist at\\r\\nall, for the reason that every case, every crime, for instance, so soon\\r\\nas it actually occurs, at once becomes a thoroughly special case and\\r\\nsometimes a case unlike any that’s gone before. Very comic cases of that\\r\\nsort sometimes occur. If I leave one man quite alone, if I don’t touch\\r\\nhim and don’t worry him, but let him know or at least suspect every\\r\\nmoment that I know all about it and am watching him day and night, and\\r\\nif he is in continual suspicion and terror, he’ll be bound to lose his\\r\\nhead. He’ll come of himself, or maybe do something which will make it as\\r\\nplain as twice two are four--it’s delightful. It may be so with a simple\\r\\npeasant, but with one of our sort, an intelligent man cultivated on a\\r\\ncertain side, it’s a dead certainty. For, my dear fellow, it’s a very\\r\\nimportant matter to know on what side a man is cultivated. And then\\r\\nthere are nerves, there are nerves, you have overlooked them! Why, they\\r\\nare all sick, nervous and irritable!... And then how they all suffer\\r\\nfrom spleen! That I assure you is a regular gold-mine for us. And it’s\\r\\nno anxiety to me, his running about the town free! Let him, let him walk\\r\\nabout for a bit! I know well enough that I’ve caught him and that he\\r\\nwon’t escape me. Where could he escape to, he-he? Abroad, perhaps? A\\r\\nPole will escape abroad, but not here, especially as I am watching\\r\\nand have taken measures. Will he escape into the depths of the country\\r\\nperhaps? But you know, peasants live there, real rude Russian peasants.\\r\\nA modern cultivated man would prefer prison to living with such\\r\\nstrangers as our peasants. He-he! But that’s all nonsense, and on\\r\\nthe surface. It’s not merely that he has nowhere to run to, he is\\r\\n_psychologically_ unable to escape me, he-he! What an expression!\\r\\nThrough a law of nature he can’t escape me if he had anywhere to go.\\r\\nHave you seen a butterfly round a candle? That’s how he will keep\\r\\ncircling and circling round me. Freedom will lose its attractions. He’ll\\r\\nbegin to brood, he’ll weave a tangle round himself, he’ll worry himself\\r\\nto death! What’s more he will provide me with a mathematical proof--if I\\r\\nonly give him long enough interval.... And he’ll keep circling round\\r\\nme, getting nearer and nearer and then--flop! He’ll fly straight into my\\r\\nmouth and I’ll swallow him, and that will be very amusing, he-he-he! You\\r\\ndon’t believe me?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov made no reply; he sat pale and motionless, still gazing with\\r\\nthe same intensity into Porfiry’s face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a lesson,” he thought, turning cold. “This is beyond the cat\\r\\nplaying with a mouse, like yesterday. He can’t be showing off his power\\r\\nwith no motive... prompting me; he is far too clever for that... he must\\r\\nhave another object. What is it? It’s all nonsense, my friend, you are\\r\\npretending, to scare me! You’ve no proofs and the man I saw had no\\r\\nreal existence. You simply want to make me lose my head, to work me up\\r\\nbeforehand and so to crush me. But you are wrong, you won’t do it! But\\r\\nwhy give me such a hint? Is he reckoning on my shattered nerves? No, my\\r\\nfriend, you are wrong, you won’t do it even though you have some trap\\r\\nfor me... let us see what you have in store for me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown ordeal. At times\\r\\nhe longed to fall on Porfiry and strangle him. This anger was what he\\r\\ndreaded from the beginning. He felt that his parched lips were flecked\\r\\nwith foam, his heart was throbbing. But he was still determined not to\\r\\nspeak till the right moment. He realised that this was the best\\r\\npolicy in his position, because instead of saying too much he would be\\r\\nirritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him into speaking too\\r\\nfreely. Anyhow, this was what he hoped for.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I see you don’t believe me, you think I am playing a harmless joke\\r\\non you,” Porfiry began again, getting more and more lively, chuckling\\r\\nat every instant and again pacing round the room. “And to be sure you’re\\r\\nright: God has given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas in\\r\\nother people; a buffoon; but let me tell you, and I repeat it, excuse\\r\\nan old man, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, you are a man still young, so to\\r\\nsay, in your first youth and so you put intellect above everything, like\\r\\nall young people. Playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and\\r\\nthat’s for all the world like the old Austrian _Hof-kriegsrath_, as\\r\\nfar as I can judge of military matters, that is: on paper they’d beaten\\r\\nNapoleon and taken him prisoner, and there in their study they worked it\\r\\nall out in the cleverest fashion, but look you, General Mack surrendered\\r\\nwith all his army, he-he-he! I see, I see, Rodion Romanovitch, you are\\r\\nlaughing at a civilian like me, taking examples out of military history!\\r\\nBut I can’t help it, it’s my weakness. I am fond of military science.\\r\\nAnd I’m ever so fond of reading all military histories. I’ve certainly\\r\\nmissed my proper career. I ought to have been in the army, upon my\\r\\nword I ought. I shouldn’t have been a Napoleon, but I might have been a\\r\\nmajor, he-he! Well, I’ll tell you the whole truth, my dear fellow, about\\r\\nthis _special case_, I mean: actual fact and a man’s temperament, my\\r\\ndear sir, are weighty matters and it’s astonishing how they sometimes\\r\\ndeceive the sharpest calculation! I--listen to an old man--am speaking\\r\\nseriously, Rodion Romanovitch” (as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch, who\\r\\nwas scarcely five-and-thirty, actually seemed to have grown old; even\\r\\nhis voice changed and he seemed to shrink together) “Moreover, I’m\\r\\na candid man... am I a candid man or not? What do you say? I fancy I\\r\\nreally am: I tell you these things for nothing and don’t even expect a\\r\\nreward for it, he-he! Well, to proceed, wit in my opinion is a splendid\\r\\nthing, it is, so to say, an adornment of nature and a consolation of\\r\\nlife, and what tricks it can play! So that it sometimes is hard for a\\r\\npoor examining lawyer to know where he is, especially when he’s liable\\r\\nto be carried away by his own fancy, too, for you know he is a man after\\r\\nall! But the poor fellow is saved by the criminal’s temperament, worse\\r\\nluck for him! But young people carried away by their own wit don’t think\\r\\nof that ‘when they overstep all obstacles,’ as you wittily and cleverly\\r\\nexpressed it yesterday. He will lie--that is, the man who is a _special\\r\\ncase_, the incognito, and he will lie well, in the cleverest fashion;\\r\\nyou might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his wit, but at\\r\\nthe most interesting, the most flagrant moment he will faint. Of course\\r\\nthere may be illness and a stuffy room as well, but anyway! Anyway he’s\\r\\ngiven us the idea! He lied incomparably, but he didn’t reckon on his\\r\\ntemperament. That’s what betrays him! Another time he will be carried\\r\\naway by his playful wit into making fun of the man who suspects him, he\\r\\nwill turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead, but his paleness will\\r\\nbe _too natural_, too much like the real thing, again he has given us\\r\\nan idea! Though his questioner may be deceived at first, he will think\\r\\ndifferently next day if he is not a fool, and, of course, it is like\\r\\nthat at every step! He puts himself forward where he is not wanted,\\r\\nspeaks continually when he ought to keep silent, brings in all sorts of\\r\\nallegorical allusions, he-he! Comes and asks why didn’t you take me long\\r\\nago? he-he-he! And that can happen, you know, with the cleverest man,\\r\\nthe psychologist, the literary man. The temperament reflects everything\\r\\nlike a mirror! Gaze into it and admire what you see! But why are you so\\r\\npale, Rodion Romanovitch? Is the room stuffy? Shall I open the window?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, don’t trouble, please,” cried Raskolnikov and he suddenly broke\\r\\ninto a laugh. “Please don’t trouble.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPorfiry stood facing him, paused a moment and suddenly he too laughed.\\r\\nRaskolnikov got up from the sofa, abruptly checking his hysterical\\r\\nlaughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Porfiry Petrovitch,” he began, speaking loudly and distinctly, though\\r\\nhis legs trembled and he could scarcely stand. “I see clearly at last\\r\\nthat you actually suspect me of murdering that old woman and her sister\\r\\nLizaveta. Let me tell you for my part that I am sick of this. If you\\r\\nfind that you have a right to prosecute me legally, to arrest me, then\\r\\nprosecute me, arrest me. But I will not let myself be jeered at to my\\r\\nface and worried...”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis lips trembled, his eyes glowed with fury and he could not restrain\\r\\nhis voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I won’t allow it!” he shouted, bringing his fist down on the table. “Do\\r\\nyou hear that, Porfiry Petrovitch? I won’t allow it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens! What does it mean?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, apparently\\r\\nquite frightened. “Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, what is the\\r\\nmatter with you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov shouted again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hush, my dear man! They’ll hear and come in. Just think, what could we\\r\\nsay to them?” Porfiry Petrovitch whispered in horror, bringing his face\\r\\nclose to Raskolnikov’s.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I won’t allow it, I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov repeated mechanically,\\r\\nbut he too spoke in a sudden whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\nPorfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Some fresh air! And you must have some water, my dear fellow. You’re\\r\\nill!” and he was running to the door to call for some when he found a\\r\\ndecanter of water in the corner. “Come, drink a little,” he whispered,\\r\\nrushing up to him with the decanter. “It will be sure to do you good.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPorfiry Petrovitch’s alarm and sympathy were so natural that Raskolnikov\\r\\nwas silent and began looking at him with wild curiosity. He did not take\\r\\nthe water, however.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, you’ll drive yourself out of your\\r\\nmind, I assure you, ach, ach! Have some water, do drink a little.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe forced him to take the glass. Raskolnikov raised it mechanically to\\r\\nhis lips, but set it on the table again with disgust.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, you’ve had a little attack! You’ll bring back your illness again,\\r\\nmy dear fellow,” Porfiry Petrovitch cackled with friendly sympathy,\\r\\nthough he still looked rather disconcerted. “Good heavens, you must\\r\\ntake more care of yourself! Dmitri Prokofitch was here, came to see me\\r\\nyesterday--I know, I know, I’ve a nasty, ironical temper, but what they\\r\\nmade of it!... Good heavens, he came yesterday after you’d been. We\\r\\ndined and he talked and talked away, and I could only throw up my hands\\r\\nin despair! Did he come from you? But do sit down, for mercy’s sake, sit\\r\\ndown!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, not from me, but I knew he went to you and why he went,”\\r\\n Raskolnikov answered sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You knew?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I knew. What of it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why this, Rodion Romanovitch, that I know more than that about you;\\r\\nI know about everything. I know how you went _to take a flat_ at night\\r\\nwhen it was dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood, so\\r\\nthat the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it. Yes, I\\r\\nunderstand your state of mind at that time... but you’ll drive yourself\\r\\nmad like that, upon my word! You’ll lose your head! You’re full of\\r\\ngenerous indignation at the wrongs you’ve received, first from destiny,\\r\\nand then from the police officers, and so you rush from one thing to\\r\\nanother to force them to speak out and make an end of it all, because\\r\\nyou are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness. That’s so, isn’t\\r\\nit? I have guessed how you feel, haven’t I? Only in that way you’ll\\r\\nlose your head and Razumihin’s, too; he’s too _good_ a man for such\\r\\na position, you must know that. You are ill and he is good and your\\r\\nillness is infectious for him... I’ll tell you about it when you are\\r\\nmore yourself.... But do sit down, for goodness’ sake. Please rest, you\\r\\nlook shocking, do sit down.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov sat down; he no longer shivered, he was hot all over. In\\r\\namazement he listened with strained attention to Porfiry Petrovitch who\\r\\nstill seemed frightened as he looked after him with friendly solicitude.\\r\\nBut he did not believe a word he said, though he felt a strange\\r\\ninclination to believe. Porfiry’s unexpected words about the flat had\\r\\nutterly overwhelmed him. “How can it be, he knows about the flat then,”\\r\\n he thought suddenly, “and he tells it me himself!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, in our legal practice there was a case almost exactly similar, a\\r\\ncase of morbid psychology,” Porfiry went on quickly. “A man confessed to\\r\\nmurder and how he kept it up! It was a regular hallucination; he brought\\r\\nforward facts, he imposed upon everyone and why? He had been partly, but\\r\\nonly partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew that\\r\\nhe had given the murderers the opportunity, he sank into dejection, it\\r\\ngot on his mind and turned his brain, he began imagining things and he\\r\\npersuaded himself that he was the murderer. But at last the High Court\\r\\nof Appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and put under\\r\\nproper care. Thanks to the Court of Appeal! Tut-tut-tut! Why, my dear\\r\\nfellow, you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse\\r\\nto work upon your nerves, to go ringing bells at night and asking about\\r\\nblood! I’ve studied all this morbid psychology in my practice. A man\\r\\nis sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry. Just the\\r\\nsame with bell-ringing.... It’s all illness, Rodion Romanovitch! You\\r\\nhave begun to neglect your illness. You should consult an experienced\\r\\ndoctor, what’s the good of that fat fellow? You are lightheaded! You\\r\\nwere delirious when you did all this!”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it possible, is it possible,” flashed through his mind, “that he is\\r\\nstill lying? He can’t be, he can’t be.” He rejected that idea, feeling\\r\\nto what a degree of fury it might drive him, feeling that that fury\\r\\nmight drive him mad.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was not delirious. I knew what I was doing,” he cried, straining\\r\\nevery faculty to penetrate Porfiry’s game, “I was quite myself, do you\\r\\nhear?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I hear and understand. You said yesterday you were not delirious,\\r\\nyou were particularly emphatic about it! I understand all you can tell\\r\\nme! A-ach!... Listen, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow. If you were\\r\\nactually a criminal, or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business,\\r\\nwould you insist that you were not delirious but in full possession\\r\\nof your faculties? And so emphatically and persistently? Would it be\\r\\npossible? Quite impossible, to my thinking. If you had anything on\\r\\nyour conscience, you certainly ought to insist that you were delirious.\\r\\nThat’s so, isn’t it?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a note of slyness in this inquiry. Raskolnikov drew back on\\r\\nthe sofa as Porfiry bent over him and stared in silent perplexity at\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Another thing about Razumihin--you certainly ought to have said that he\\r\\ncame of his own accord, to have concealed your part in it! But you don’t\\r\\nconceal it! You lay stress on his coming at your instigation.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov had not done so. A chill went down his back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You keep telling lies,” he said slowly and weakly, twisting his lips\\r\\ninto a sickly smile, “you are trying again to show that you know all\\r\\nmy game, that you know all I shall say beforehand,” he said, conscious\\r\\nhimself that he was not weighing his words as he ought. “You want to\\r\\nfrighten me... or you are simply laughing at me...”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe still stared at him as he said this and again there was a light of\\r\\nintense hatred in his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You keep lying,” he said. “You know perfectly well that the best\\r\\npolicy for the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly as possible... to\\r\\nconceal as little as possible. I don’t believe you!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a wily person you are!” Porfiry tittered, “there’s no catching\\r\\nyou; you’ve a perfect monomania. So you don’t believe me? But still you\\r\\ndo believe me, you believe a quarter; I’ll soon make you believe the\\r\\nwhole, because I have a sincere liking for you and genuinely wish you\\r\\ngood.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov’s lips trembled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I do,” went on Porfiry, touching Raskolnikov’s arm genially, “you\\r\\nmust take care of your illness. Besides, your mother and sister are here\\r\\nnow; you must think of them. You must soothe and comfort them and you do\\r\\nnothing but frighten them...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What has that to do with you? How do you know it? What concern is it of\\r\\nyours? You are keeping watch on me and want to let me know it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens! Why, I learnt it all from you yourself! You don’t\\r\\nnotice that in your excitement you tell me and others everything. From\\r\\nRazumihin, too, I learnt a number of interesting details yesterday. No,\\r\\nyou interrupted me, but I must tell you that, for all your wit, your\\r\\nsuspiciousness makes you lose the common-sense view of things. To return\\r\\nto bell-ringing, for instance. I, an examining lawyer, have betrayed a\\r\\nprecious thing like that, a real fact (for it is a fact worth having),\\r\\nand you see nothing in it! Why, if I had the slightest suspicion of you,\\r\\nshould I have acted like that? No, I should first have disarmed your\\r\\nsuspicions and not let you see I knew of that fact, should have diverted\\r\\nyour attention and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow (your\\r\\nexpression) saying: ‘And what were you doing, sir, pray, at ten or\\r\\nnearly eleven at the murdered woman’s flat and why did you ring the bell\\r\\nand why did you ask about blood? And why did you invite the porters\\r\\nto go with you to the police station, to the lieutenant?’ That’s how\\r\\nI ought to have acted if I had a grain of suspicion of you. I ought to\\r\\nhave taken your evidence in due form, searched your lodging and perhaps\\r\\nhave arrested you, too... so I have no suspicion of you, since I have\\r\\nnot done that! But you can’t look at it normally and you see nothing, I\\r\\nsay again.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov started so that Porfiry Petrovitch could not fail to\\r\\nperceive it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are lying all the while,” he cried, “I don’t know your object,\\r\\nbut you are lying. You did not speak like that just now and I cannot be\\r\\nmistaken!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am lying?” Porfiry repeated, apparently incensed, but preserving\\r\\na good-humoured and ironical face, as though he were not in the least\\r\\nconcerned at Raskolnikov’s opinion of him. “I am lying... but how did\\r\\nI treat you just now, I, the examining lawyer? Prompting you and giving\\r\\nyou every means for your defence; illness, I said, delirium, injury,\\r\\nmelancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it? Ah! He-he-he!\\r\\nThough, indeed, all those psychological means of defence are not very\\r\\nreliable and cut both ways: illness, delirium, I don’t remember--that’s\\r\\nall right, but why, my good sir, in your illness and in your delirium\\r\\nwere you haunted by just those delusions and not by any others? There\\r\\nmay have been others, eh? He-he-he!”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov looked haughtily and contemptuously at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Briefly,” he said loudly and imperiously, rising to his feet and in so\\r\\ndoing pushing Porfiry back a little, “briefly, I want to know, do you\\r\\nacknowledge me perfectly free from suspicion or not? Tell me, Porfiry\\r\\nPetrovitch, tell me once for all and make haste!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a business I’m having with you!” cried Porfiry with a perfectly\\r\\ngood-humoured, sly and composed face. “And why do you want to know, why\\r\\ndo you want to know so much, since they haven’t begun to worry you? Why,\\r\\nyou are like a child asking for matches! And why are you so uneasy? Why\\r\\ndo you force yourself upon us, eh? He-he-he!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I repeat,” Raskolnikov cried furiously, “that I can’t put up with it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“With what? Uncertainty?” interrupted Porfiry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t jeer at me! I won’t have it! I tell you I won’t have it. I can’t\\r\\nand I won’t, do you hear, do you hear?” he shouted, bringing his fist\\r\\ndown on the table again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hush! Hush! They’ll overhear! I warn you seriously, take care of\\r\\nyourself. I am not joking,” Porfiry whispered, but this time there was\\r\\nnot the look of old womanish good nature and alarm in his face. Now\\r\\nhe was peremptory, stern, frowning and for once laying aside all\\r\\nmystification.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this was only for an instant. Raskolnikov, bewildered, suddenly fell\\r\\ninto actual frenzy, but, strange to say, he again obeyed the command to\\r\\nspeak quietly, though he was in a perfect paroxysm of fury.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will not allow myself to be tortured,” he whispered, instantly\\r\\nrecognising with hatred that he could not help obeying the command and\\r\\ndriven to even greater fury by the thought. “Arrest me, search me, but\\r\\nkindly act in due form and don’t play with me! Don’t dare!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t worry about the form,” Porfiry interrupted with the same sly\\r\\nsmile, as it were, gloating with enjoyment over Raskolnikov. “I invited\\r\\nyou to see me quite in a friendly way.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t want your friendship and I spit on it! Do you hear? And, here,\\r\\nI take my cap and go. What will you say now if you mean to arrest me?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took up his cap and went to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And won’t you see my little surprise?” chuckled Porfiry, again taking\\r\\nhim by the arm and stopping him at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed to become more playful and good-humoured which maddened\\r\\nRaskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What surprise?” he asked, standing still and looking at Porfiry in\\r\\nalarm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My little surprise, it’s sitting there behind the door, he-he-he!”\\r\\n (He pointed to the locked door.) “I locked him in that he should not\\r\\nescape.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it? Where? What?...”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened it, but it was\\r\\nlocked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s locked, here is the key!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he brought a key out of his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are lying,” roared Raskolnikov without restraint, “you lie, you\\r\\ndamned punchinello!” and he rushed at Porfiry who retreated to the other\\r\\ndoor, not at all alarmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I understand it all! You are lying and mocking so that I may betray\\r\\nmyself to you...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, you could not betray yourself any further, my dear Rodion\\r\\nRomanovitch. You are in a passion. Don’t shout, I shall call the\\r\\nclerks.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are lying! Call the clerks! You knew I was ill and tried to work\\r\\nme into a frenzy to make me betray myself, that was your object! Produce\\r\\nyour facts! I understand it all. You’ve no evidence, you have only\\r\\nwretched rubbishly suspicions like Zametov’s! You knew my character, you\\r\\nwanted to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priests and\\r\\ndeputies.... Are you waiting for them? eh! What are you waiting for?\\r\\nWhere are they? Produce them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why deputies, my good man? What things people will imagine! And to do\\r\\nso would not be acting in form as you say, you don’t know the business,\\r\\nmy dear fellow.... And there’s no escaping form, as you see,” Porfiry\\r\\nmuttered, listening at the door through which a noise could be heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, they’re coming,” cried Raskolnikov. “You’ve sent for them! You\\r\\nexpected them! Well, produce them all: your deputies, your witnesses,\\r\\nwhat you like!... I am ready!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at this moment a strange incident occurred, something so unexpected\\r\\nthat neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry Petrovitch could have looked for\\r\\nsuch a conclusion to their interview.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he remembered the scene afterwards, this is how Raskolnikov saw it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe noise behind the door increased, and suddenly the door was opened a\\r\\nlittle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, annoyed. “Why, I gave orders...”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor an instant there was no answer, but it was evident that there were\\r\\nseveral persons at the door, and that they were apparently pushing\\r\\nsomebody back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?” Porfiry Petrovitch repeated, uneasily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The prisoner Nikolay has been brought,” someone answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is not wanted! Take him away! Let him wait! What’s he doing here?\\r\\nHow irregular!” cried Porfiry, rushing to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But he...” began the same voice, and suddenly ceased.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo seconds, not more, were spent in actual struggle, then someone gave\\r\\na violent shove, and then a man, very pale, strode into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis man’s appearance was at first sight very strange. He stared\\r\\nstraight before him, as though seeing nothing. There was a determined\\r\\ngleam in his eyes; at the same time there was a deathly pallor in his\\r\\nface, as though he were being led to the scaffold. His white lips were\\r\\nfaintly twitching.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was dressed like a workman and was of medium height, very young,\\r\\nslim, his hair cut in round crop, with thin spare features. The man whom\\r\\nhe had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing\\r\\nhim by the shoulder; he was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his arm away.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway. Some of them\\r\\ntried to get in. All this took place almost instantaneously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go away, it’s too soon! Wait till you are sent for!... Why have you\\r\\nbrought him so soon?” Porfiry Petrovitch muttered, extremely annoyed,\\r\\nand as it were thrown out of his reckoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Nikolay suddenly knelt down.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s the matter?” cried Porfiry, surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am guilty! Mine is the sin! I am the murderer,” Nikolay articulated\\r\\nsuddenly, rather breathless, but speaking fairly loudly.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb;\\r\\neven the warder stepped back, mechanically retreated to the door, and\\r\\nstood immovable.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, recovering from his momentary\\r\\nstupefaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I... am the murderer,” repeated Nikolay, after a brief pause.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What... you... what... whom did you kill?” Porfiry Petrovitch was\\r\\nobviously bewildered.\\r\\n\\r\\nNikolay again was silent for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna, I... killed... with\\r\\nan axe. Darkness came over me,” he added suddenly, and was again silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe still remained on his knees. Porfiry Petrovitch stood for some\\r\\nmoments as though meditating, but suddenly roused himself and waved back\\r\\nthe uninvited spectators. They instantly vanished and closed the door.\\r\\nThen he looked towards Raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner,\\r\\nstaring wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped short,\\r\\nlooked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again at Nikolay, and\\r\\nseeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re in too great a hurry,” he shouted at him, almost angrily. “I\\r\\ndidn’t ask you what came over you.... Speak, did you kill them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am the murderer.... I want to give evidence,” Nikolay pronounced.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ach! What did you kill them with?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“An axe. I had it ready.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ach, he is in a hurry! Alone?”\\r\\n\\r\\nNikolay did not understand the question.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you do it alone?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, alone. And Mitka is not guilty and had no share in it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t be in a hurry about Mitka! A-ach! How was it you ran downstairs\\r\\nlike that at the time? The porters met you both!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was to put them off the scent... I ran after Mitka,” Nikolay replied\\r\\nhurriedly, as though he had prepared the answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I knew it!” cried Porfiry, with vexation. “It’s not his own tale he is\\r\\ntelling,” he muttered as though to himself, and suddenly his eyes rested\\r\\non Raskolnikov again.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a moment he had\\r\\nforgotten Raskolnikov. He was a little taken aback.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear Rodion Romanovitch, excuse me!” he flew up to him, “this won’t\\r\\ndo; I’m afraid you must go... it’s no good your staying... I will...\\r\\nyou see, what a surprise!... Good-bye!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose you didn’t expect it?” said Raskolnikov who, though he had\\r\\nnot yet fully grasped the situation, had regained his courage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You did not expect it either, my friend. See how your hand is\\r\\ntrembling! He-he!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re trembling, too, Porfiry Petrovitch!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I am; I didn’t expect it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were already at the door; Porfiry was impatient for Raskolnikov to\\r\\nbe gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And your little surprise, aren’t you going to show it to me?”\\r\\n Raskolnikov said, sarcastically.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, his teeth are chattering as he asks, he-he! You are an ironical\\r\\nperson! Come, till we meet!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I believe we can say _good-bye_!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s in God’s hands,” muttered Porfiry, with an unnatural smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed that many people\\r\\nwere looking at him. Among them he saw the two porters from _the_ house,\\r\\nwhom he had invited that night to the police station. They stood there\\r\\nwaiting. But he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of\\r\\nPorfiry Petrovitch behind him. Turning round, he saw the latter running\\r\\nafter him, out of breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, it’s in God’s hands,\\r\\nbut as a matter of form there are some questions I shall have to ask\\r\\nyou... so we shall meet again, shan’t we?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Porfiry stood still, facing him with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shan’t we?” he added again.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed to want to say something more, but could not speak out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what has just passed... I\\r\\nlost my temper,” began Raskolnikov, who had so far regained his courage\\r\\nthat he felt irresistibly inclined to display his coolness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t mention it, don’t mention it,” Porfiry replied, almost gleefully.\\r\\n“I myself, too... I have a wicked temper, I admit it! But we shall meet\\r\\nagain. If it’s God’s will, we may see a great deal of one another.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And will get to know each other through and through?” added\\r\\nRaskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes; know each other through and through,” assented Porfiry Petrovitch,\\r\\nand he screwed up his eyes, looking earnestly at Raskolnikov. “Now\\r\\nyou’re going to a birthday party?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To a funeral.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course, the funeral! Take care of yourself, and get well.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know what to wish you,” said Raskolnikov, who had begun to\\r\\ndescend the stairs, but looked back again. “I should like to wish you\\r\\nsuccess, but your office is such a comical one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why comical?” Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go, but he seemed to\\r\\nprick up his ears at this.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor Nikolay\\r\\npsychologically, after your fashion, till he confessed! You must have\\r\\nbeen at him day and night, proving to him that he was the murderer, and\\r\\nnow that he has confessed, you’ll begin vivisecting him again. ‘You are\\r\\nlying,’ you’ll say. ‘You are not the murderer! You can’t be! It’s not\\r\\nyour own tale you are telling!’ You must admit it’s a comical business!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He-he-he! You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just now that it was\\r\\nnot his own tale he was telling?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How could I help noticing it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He-he! You are quick-witted. You notice everything! You’ve really a\\r\\nplayful mind! And you always fasten on the comic side... he-he! They say\\r\\nthat was the marked characteristic of Gogol, among the writers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, of Gogol.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, of Gogol.... I shall look forward to meeting you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So shall I.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov walked straight home. He was so muddled and bewildered that\\r\\non getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa, trying to\\r\\ncollect his thoughts. He did not attempt to think about Nikolay; he\\r\\nwas stupefied; he felt that his confession was something inexplicable,\\r\\namazing--something beyond his understanding. But Nikolay’s confession\\r\\nwas an actual fact. The consequences of this fact were clear to him at\\r\\nonce, its falsehood could not fail to be discovered, and then they\\r\\nwould be after him again. Till then, at least, he was free and must do\\r\\nsomething for himself, for the danger was imminent.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how imminent? His position gradually became clear to him.\\r\\nRemembering, sketchily, the main outlines of his recent scene with\\r\\nPorfiry, he could not help shuddering again with horror. Of course,\\r\\nhe did not yet know all Porfiry’s aims, he could not see into all his\\r\\ncalculations. But he had already partly shown his hand, and no one knew\\r\\nbetter than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiry’s “lead” had been for\\r\\nhim. A little more and he _might_ have given himself away completely,\\r\\ncircumstantially. Knowing his nervous temperament and from the first\\r\\nglance seeing through him, Porfiry, though playing a bold game, was\\r\\nbound to win. There’s no denying that Raskolnikov had compromised\\r\\nhimself seriously, but no _facts_ had come to light as yet; there was\\r\\nnothing positive. But was he taking a true view of the position? Wasn’t\\r\\nhe mistaken? What had Porfiry been trying to get at? Had he really some\\r\\nsurprise prepared for him? And what was it? Had he really been expecting\\r\\nsomething or not? How would they have parted if it had not been for the\\r\\nunexpected appearance of Nikolay?\\r\\n\\r\\nPorfiry had shown almost all his cards--of course, he had risked\\r\\nsomething in showing them--and if he had really had anything up his\\r\\nsleeve (Raskolnikov reflected), he would have shown that, too. What was\\r\\nthat “surprise”? Was it a joke? Had it meant anything? Could it have\\r\\nconcealed anything like a fact, a piece of positive evidence? His\\r\\nyesterday’s visitor? What had become of him? Where was he to-day? If\\r\\nPorfiry really had any evidence, it must be connected with him....\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden in\\r\\nhis hands. He was still shivering nervously. At last he got up, took his\\r\\ncap, thought a minute, and went to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at least, he might\\r\\nconsider himself out of danger. He had a sudden sense almost of joy; he\\r\\nwanted to make haste to Katerina Ivanovna’s. He would be too late for\\r\\nthe funeral, of course, but he would be in time for the memorial dinner,\\r\\nand there at once he would see Sonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood still, thought a moment, and a suffering smile came for a\\r\\nmoment on to his lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To-day! To-day,” he repeated to himself. “Yes, to-day! So it must\\r\\nbe....”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as he was about to open the door, it began opening of itself. He\\r\\nstarted and moved back. The door opened gently and slowly, and there\\r\\nsuddenly appeared a figure--yesterday’s visitor _from underground_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man stood in the doorway, looked at Raskolnikov without speaking,\\r\\nand took a step forward into the room. He was exactly the same as\\r\\nyesterday; the same figure, the same dress, but there was a great change\\r\\nin his face; he looked dejected and sighed deeply. If he had only put\\r\\nhis hand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he would have\\r\\nlooked exactly like a peasant woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you want?” asked Raskolnikov, numb with terror. The man was\\r\\nstill silent, but suddenly he bowed down almost to the ground, touching\\r\\nit with his finger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?” cried Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have sinned,” the man articulated softly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By evil thoughts.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey looked at one another.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was vexed. When you came, perhaps in drink, and bade the porters go\\r\\nto the police station and asked about the blood, I was vexed that they\\r\\nlet you go and took you for drunken. I was so vexed that I lost my\\r\\nsleep. And remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for\\r\\nyou....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who came?” Raskolnikov interrupted, instantly beginning to recollect.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I did, I’ve wronged you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you come from that house?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was standing at the gate with them... don’t you remember? We have\\r\\ncarried on our trade in that house for years past. We cure and prepare\\r\\nhides, we take work home... most of all I was vexed....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came\\r\\nclearly before Raskolnikov’s mind; he recollected that there had\\r\\nbeen several people there besides the porters, women among them.\\r\\nHe remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the\\r\\npolice-station. He could not recall the face of the speaker, and even\\r\\nnow he did not recognise it, but he remembered that he had turned round\\r\\nand made him some answer....\\r\\n\\r\\nSo this was the solution of yesterday’s horror. The most awful thought\\r\\nwas that he had been actually almost lost, had almost done for himself\\r\\non account of such a _trivial_ circumstance. So this man could tell\\r\\nnothing except his asking about the flat and the blood stains. So\\r\\nPorfiry, too, had nothing but that _delirium_, no facts but this\\r\\n_psychology_ which _cuts both ways_, nothing positive. So if no more\\r\\nfacts come to light (and they must not, they must not!) then... then\\r\\nwhat can they do to him? How can they convict him, even if they arrest\\r\\nhim? And Porfiry then had only just heard about the flat and had not\\r\\nknown about it before.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was it you who told Porfiry... that I’d been there?” he cried, struck\\r\\nby a sudden idea.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What Porfiry?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The head of the detective department?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. The porters did not go there, but I went.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To-day?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I got there two minutes before you. And I heard, I heard it all, how he\\r\\nworried you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where? What? When?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, in the next room. I was sitting there all the time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What? Why, then you were the surprise? But how could it happen? Upon my\\r\\nword!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I saw that the porters did not want to do what I said,” began the man;\\r\\n“for it’s too late, said they, and maybe he’ll be angry that we did not\\r\\ncome at the time. I was vexed and I lost my sleep, and I began making\\r\\ninquiries. And finding out yesterday where to go, I went to-day. The\\r\\nfirst time I went he wasn’t there, when I came an hour later he couldn’t\\r\\nsee me. I went the third time, and they showed me in. I informed him of\\r\\neverything, just as it happened, and he began skipping about the room\\r\\nand punching himself on the chest. ‘What do you scoundrels mean by it?\\r\\nIf I’d known about it I should have arrested him!’ Then he ran out,\\r\\ncalled somebody and began talking to him in the corner, then he turned\\r\\nto me, scolding and questioning me. He scolded me a great deal; and I\\r\\ntold him everything, and I told him that you didn’t dare to say a word\\r\\nin answer to me yesterday and that you didn’t recognise me. And he\\r\\nfell to running about again and kept hitting himself on the chest, and\\r\\ngetting angry and running about, and when you were announced he told\\r\\nme to go into the next room. ‘Sit there a bit,’ he said. ‘Don’t move,\\r\\nwhatever you may hear.’ And he set a chair there for me and locked\\r\\nme in. ‘Perhaps,’ he said, ‘I may call you.’ And when Nikolay’d been\\r\\nbrought he let me out as soon as you were gone. ‘I shall send for you\\r\\nagain and question you,’ he said.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And did he question Nikolay while you were there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He got rid of me as he did of you, before he spoke to Nikolay.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man stood still, and again suddenly bowed down, touching the ground\\r\\nwith his finger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Forgive me for my evil thoughts, and my slander.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“May God forgive you,” answered Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as he said this, the man bowed down again, but not to the ground,\\r\\nturned slowly and went out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It all cuts both ways, now it all cuts both ways,” repeated\\r\\nRaskolnikov, and he went out more confident than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now we’ll make a fight for it,” he said, with a malicious smile, as he\\r\\nwent down the stairs. His malice was aimed at himself; with shame and\\r\\ncontempt he recollected his “cowardice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART V\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning that followed the fateful interview with Dounia and\\r\\nher mother brought sobering influences to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch.\\r\\nIntensely unpleasant as it was, he was forced little by little to accept\\r\\nas a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day before\\r\\nfantastic and incredible. The black snake of wounded vanity had been\\r\\ngnawing at his heart all night. When he got out of bed, Pyotr Petrovitch\\r\\nimmediately looked in the looking-glass. He was afraid that he had\\r\\njaundice. However his health seemed unimpaired so far, and looking at\\r\\nhis noble, clear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish of\\r\\nlate, Pyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in the\\r\\nconviction that he would find another bride and, perhaps, even a better\\r\\none. But coming back to the sense of his present position, he turned\\r\\naside and spat vigorously, which excited a sarcastic smile in Andrey\\r\\nSemyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he was staying.\\r\\nThat smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once set it down against his\\r\\nyoung friend’s account. He had set down a good many points against him\\r\\nof late. His anger was redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to\\r\\nhave told Andrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterday’s interview.\\r\\nThat was the second mistake he had made in temper, through impulsiveness\\r\\nand irritability.... Moreover, all that morning one unpleasantness\\r\\nfollowed another. He even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case\\r\\nin the senate. He was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat\\r\\nwhich had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and was being\\r\\nredecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich German tradesman,\\r\\nwould not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just\\r\\nbeen signed and insisted on the full forfeit money, though Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated. In\\r\\nthe same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the\\r\\ninstalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the\\r\\nflat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Am I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture?” Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a\\r\\ngleam of desperate hope. “Can all that be really so irrevocably over?\\r\\nIs it no use to make another effort?” The thought of Dounia sent a\\r\\nvoluptuous pang through his heart. He endured anguish at that moment,\\r\\nand if it had been possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it,\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was my mistake, too, not to have given them money,” he thought, as\\r\\nhe returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikov’s room, “and why on earth was I\\r\\nsuch a Jew? It was false economy! I meant to keep them without a penny\\r\\nso that they should turn to me as their providence, and look at them!\\r\\nfoo! If I’d spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseau\\r\\nand presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, jewellery, materials, and\\r\\nall that sort of trash from Knopp’s and the English shop, my position\\r\\nwould have been better and... stronger! They could not have refused me\\r\\nso easily! They are the sort of people that would feel bound to return\\r\\nmoney and presents if they broke it off; and they would find it hard to\\r\\ndo it! And their conscience would prick them: how can we dismiss a man\\r\\nwho has hitherto been so generous and delicate?.... H’m! I’ve made a\\r\\nblunder.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd grinding his teeth again, Pyotr Petrovitch called himself a\\r\\nfool--but not aloud, of course.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe returned home, twice as irritated and angry as before. The\\r\\npreparations for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanovna’s excited\\r\\nhis curiosity as he passed. He had heard about it the day before; he\\r\\nfancied, indeed, that he had been invited, but absorbed in his own cares\\r\\nhe had paid no attention. Inquiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busy\\r\\nlaying the table while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery, he\\r\\nheard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all the\\r\\nlodgers had been invited, among them some who had not known the dead\\r\\nman, that even Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of\\r\\nhis previous quarrel with Katerina Ivanovna, that he, Pyotr Petrovitch,\\r\\nwas not only invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most\\r\\nimportant of the lodgers. Amalia Ivanovna herself had been invited with\\r\\ngreat ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness, and so she was\\r\\nvery busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them;\\r\\nshe was moreover dressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and she\\r\\nwas proud of it. All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch and he\\r\\nwent into his room, or rather Lebeziatnikov’s, somewhat thoughtful. He\\r\\nhad learnt that Raskolnikov was to be one of the guests.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morning. The attitude of\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman was strange, though perhaps natural.\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch had despised and hated him from the day he came to stay\\r\\nwith him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him. He\\r\\nhad not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg simply from\\r\\nparsimony, though that had been perhaps his chief object. He had heard\\r\\nof Andrey Semyonovitch, who had once been his ward, as a leading young\\r\\nprogressive who was taking an important part in certain interesting\\r\\ncircles, the doings of which were a legend in the provinces. It had\\r\\nimpressed Pyotr Petrovitch. These powerful omniscient circles who\\r\\ndespised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him a\\r\\npeculiar but quite vague alarm. He had not, of course, been able to form\\r\\neven an approximate notion of what they meant. He, like everyone, had\\r\\nheard that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of some\\r\\nsort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he exaggerated and\\r\\ndistorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree. What for\\r\\nmany years past he had feared more than anything was _being shown\\r\\nup_ and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the\\r\\nthought of transferring his business to Petersburg. He was afraid of\\r\\nthis as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. Some years before,\\r\\nwhen he was just entering on his own career, he had come upon two cases\\r\\nin which rather important personages in the province, patrons of his,\\r\\nhad been cruelly shown up. One instance had ended in great scandal\\r\\nfor the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious\\r\\ntrouble. For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to go into the\\r\\nsubject as soon as he reached Petersburg and, if necessary, to\\r\\nanticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of “our younger\\r\\ngeneration.” He relied on Andrey Semyonovitch for this and before\\r\\nhis visit to Raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current\\r\\nphrases. He soon discovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplace\\r\\nsimpleton, but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch. Even if he\\r\\nhad been certain that all the progressives were fools like him, it\\r\\nwould not have allayed his uneasiness. All the doctrines, the ideas, the\\r\\nsystems, with which Andrey Semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for\\r\\nhim. He had his own object--he simply wanted to find out at once what\\r\\nwas happening _here_. Had these people any power or not? Had he anything\\r\\nto fear from them? Would they expose any enterprise of his? And what\\r\\nprecisely was now the object of their attacks? Could he somehow make up\\r\\nto them and get round them if they really were powerful? Was this the\\r\\nthing to do or not? Couldn’t he gain something through them? In fact\\r\\nhundreds of questions presented themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrey Semyonovitch was an anæmic, scrofulous little man, with strangely\\r\\nflaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which he was very proud. He was a clerk\\r\\nand had almost always something wrong with his eyes. He was rather\\r\\nsoft-hearted, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited in\\r\\nspeech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with his little figure.\\r\\nHe was one of the lodgers most respected by Amalia Ivanovna, for he did\\r\\nnot get drunk and paid regularly for his lodgings. Andrey Semyonovitch\\r\\nreally was rather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progress\\r\\nand “our younger generation” from enthusiasm. He was one of the numerous\\r\\nand varied legion of dullards, of half-animate abortions, conceited,\\r\\nhalf-educated coxcombs, who attach themselves to the idea most in\\r\\nfashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve,\\r\\nhowever sincerely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Lebeziatnikov was so good-natured, he, too, was beginning to\\r\\ndislike Pyotr Petrovitch. This happened on both sides unconsciously.\\r\\nHowever simple Andrey Semyonovitch might be, he began to see that Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch was duping him and secretly despising him, and that “he was\\r\\nnot the right sort of man.” He had tried expounding to him the system of\\r\\nFourier and the Darwinian theory, but of late Pyotr Petrovitch began to\\r\\nlisten too sarcastically and even to be rude. The fact was he had begun\\r\\ninstinctively to guess that Lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace\\r\\nsimpleton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he had no connections of\\r\\nany consequence even in his own circle, but had simply picked things up\\r\\nthird-hand; and that very likely he did not even know much about his own\\r\\nwork of propaganda, for he was in too great a muddle. A fine person he\\r\\nwould be to show anyone up! It must be noted, by the way, that Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accepted the strangest\\r\\npraise from Andrey Semyonovitch; he had not protested, for instance,\\r\\nwhen Andrey Semyonovitch belauded him for being ready to contribute to\\r\\nthe establishment of the new “commune,” or to abstain from christening\\r\\nhis future children, or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take a lover a\\r\\nmonth after marriage, and so on. Pyotr Petrovitch so enjoyed hearing\\r\\nhis own praises that he did not disdain even such virtues when they were\\r\\nattributed to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch had had occasion that morning to realise some\\r\\nfive-per-cent bonds and now he sat down to the table and counted over\\r\\nbundles of notes. Andrey Semyonovitch who hardly ever had any money\\r\\nwalked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank\\r\\nnotes with indifference and even contempt. Nothing would have convinced\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch that Andrey Semyonovitch could really look on the money\\r\\nunmoved, and the latter, on his side, kept thinking bitterly that Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch was capable of entertaining such an idea about him and\\r\\nwas, perhaps, glad of the opportunity of teasing his young friend by\\r\\nreminding him of his inferiority and the great difference between them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found him incredibly inattentive and irritable, though he, Andrey\\r\\nSemyonovitch, began enlarging on his favourite subject, the foundation\\r\\nof a new special “commune.” The brief remarks that dropped from Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch between the clicking of the beads on the reckoning frame\\r\\nbetrayed unmistakable and discourteous irony. But the “humane” Andrey\\r\\nSemyonovitch ascribed Pyotr Petrovitch’s ill-humour to his recent breach\\r\\nwith Dounia and he was burning with impatience to discourse on that\\r\\ntheme. He had something progressive to say on the subject which\\r\\nmight console his worthy friend and “could not fail” to promote his\\r\\ndevelopment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is some sort of festivity being prepared at that... at the\\r\\nwidow’s, isn’t there?” Pyotr Petrovitch asked suddenly, interrupting\\r\\nAndrey Semyonovitch at the most interesting passage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, don’t you know? Why, I was telling you last night what I think\\r\\nabout all such ceremonies. And she invited you too, I heard. You were\\r\\ntalking to her yesterday...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent on\\r\\nthis feast all the money she got from that other fool, Raskolnikov. I\\r\\nwas surprised just now as I came through at the preparations there, the\\r\\nwines! Several people are invited. It’s beyond everything!” continued\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch, who seemed to have some object in pursuing the\\r\\nconversation. “What? You say I am asked too? When was that? I don’t\\r\\nremember. But I shan’t go. Why should I? I only said a word to her in\\r\\npassing yesterday of the possibility of her obtaining a year’s salary as\\r\\na destitute widow of a government clerk. I suppose she has invited me on\\r\\nthat account, hasn’t she? He-he-he!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t intend to go either,” said Lebeziatnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should think not, after giving her a thrashing! You might well\\r\\nhesitate, he-he!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who thrashed? Whom?” cried Lebeziatnikov, flustered and blushing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month ago. I heard so\\r\\nyesterday... so that’s what your convictions amount to... and the woman\\r\\nquestion, too, wasn’t quite sound, he-he-he!” and Pyotr Petrovitch, as\\r\\nthough comforted, went back to clicking his beads.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s all slander and nonsense!” cried Lebeziatnikov, who was always\\r\\nafraid of allusions to the subject. “It was not like that at all, it\\r\\nwas quite different. You’ve heard it wrong; it’s a libel. I was simply\\r\\ndefending myself. She rushed at me first with her nails, she pulled\\r\\nout all my whiskers.... It’s permissable for anyone, I should hope,\\r\\nto defend himself and I never allow anyone to use violence to me on\\r\\nprinciple, for it’s an act of despotism. What was I to do? I simply\\r\\npushed her back.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He-he-he!” Luzhin went on laughing maliciously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You keep on like that because you are out of humour yourself.... But\\r\\nthat’s nonsense and it has nothing, nothing whatever to do with the\\r\\nwoman question! You don’t understand; I used to think, indeed, that\\r\\nif women are equal to men in all respects, even in strength (as is\\r\\nmaintained now) there ought to be equality in that, too. Of course, I\\r\\nreflected afterwards that such a question ought not really to arise,\\r\\nfor there ought not to be fighting and in the future society fighting is\\r\\nunthinkable... and that it would be a queer thing to seek for equality\\r\\nin fighting. I am not so stupid... though, of course, there is\\r\\nfighting... there won’t be later, but at present there is... confound\\r\\nit! How muddled one gets with you! It’s not on that account that I\\r\\nam not going. I am not going on principle, not to take part in the\\r\\nrevolting convention of memorial dinners, that’s why! Though, of course,\\r\\none might go to laugh at it.... I am sorry there won’t be any priests at\\r\\nit. I should certainly go if there were.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you would sit down at another man’s table and insult it and those\\r\\nwho invited you. Eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly not insult, but protest. I should do it with a good object. I\\r\\nmight indirectly assist the cause of enlightenment and propaganda. It’s\\r\\na duty of every man to work for enlightenment and propaganda and the\\r\\nmore harshly, perhaps, the better. I might drop a seed, an idea.... And\\r\\nsomething might grow up from that seed. How should I be insulting them?\\r\\nThey might be offended at first, but afterwards they’d see I’d done them\\r\\na service. You know, Terebyeva (who is in the community now) was blamed\\r\\nbecause when she left her family and... devoted... herself, she wrote to\\r\\nher father and mother that she wouldn’t go on living conventionally and\\r\\nwas entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh,\\r\\nthat she might have spared them and have written more kindly. I think\\r\\nthat’s all nonsense and there’s no need of softness; on the contrary,\\r\\nwhat’s wanted is protest. Varents had been married seven years, she\\r\\nabandoned her two children, she told her husband straight out in a\\r\\nletter: ‘I have realised that I cannot be happy with you. I can never\\r\\nforgive you that you have deceived me by concealing from me that there\\r\\nis another organisation of society by means of the communities. I have\\r\\nonly lately learned it from a great-hearted man to whom I have given\\r\\nmyself and with whom I am establishing a community. I speak plainly\\r\\nbecause I consider it dishonest to deceive you. Do as you think best.\\r\\nDo not hope to get me back, you are too late. I hope you will be happy.’\\r\\nThat’s how letters like that ought to be written!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that Terebyeva the one you said had made a third free marriage?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, it’s only the second, really! But what if it were the fourth, what\\r\\nif it were the fifteenth, that’s all nonsense! And if ever I regretted\\r\\nthe death of my father and mother, it is now, and I sometimes think\\r\\nif my parents were living what a protest I would have aimed at them! I\\r\\nwould have done something on purpose... I would have shown them! I would\\r\\nhave astonished them! I am really sorry there is no one!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To surprise! He-he! Well, be that as you will,” Pyotr Petrovitch\\r\\ninterrupted, “but tell me this; do you know the dead man’s daughter, the\\r\\ndelicate-looking little thing? It’s true what they say about her, isn’t\\r\\nit?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What of it? I think, that is, it is my own personal conviction that\\r\\nthis is the normal condition of women. Why not? I mean, _distinguons_.\\r\\nIn our present society it is not altogether normal, because it is\\r\\ncompulsory, but in the future society it will be perfectly normal,\\r\\nbecause it will be voluntary. Even as it is, she was quite right: she\\r\\nwas suffering and that was her asset, so to speak, her capital which\\r\\nshe had a perfect right to dispose of. Of course, in the future\\r\\nsociety there will be no need of assets, but her part will have another\\r\\nsignificance, rational and in harmony with her environment. As to Sofya\\r\\nSemyonovna personally, I regard her action as a vigorous protest against\\r\\nthe organisation of society, and I respect her deeply for it; I rejoice\\r\\nindeed when I look at her!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLebeziatnikov was enraged.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s another slander,” he yelled. “It was not so at all! That was all\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna’s invention, for she did not understand! And I never\\r\\nmade love to Sofya Semyonovna! I was simply developing her, entirely\\r\\ndisinterestedly, trying to rouse her to protest.... All I wanted was her\\r\\nprotest and Sofya Semyonovna could not have remained here anyway!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you asked her to join your community?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You keep on laughing and very inappropriately, allow me to tell\\r\\nyou. You don’t understand! There is no such rôle in a community. The\\r\\ncommunity is established that there should be no such rôles. In a\\r\\ncommunity, such a rôle is essentially transformed and what is stupid\\r\\nhere is sensible there, what, under present conditions, is unnatural\\r\\nbecomes perfectly natural in the community. It all depends on the\\r\\nenvironment. It’s all the environment and man himself is nothing. And\\r\\nI am on good terms with Sofya Semyonovna to this day, which is a proof\\r\\nthat she never regarded me as having wronged her. I am trying now to\\r\\nattract her to the community, but on quite, quite a different footing.\\r\\nWhat are you laughing at? We are trying to establish a community of\\r\\nour own, a special one, on a broader basis. We have gone further in our\\r\\nconvictions. We reject more! And meanwhile I’m still developing Sofya\\r\\nSemyonovna. She has a beautiful, beautiful character!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you take advantage of her fine character, eh? He-he!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no! Oh, no! On the contrary.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, on the contrary! He-he-he! A queer thing to say!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Believe me! Why should I disguise it? In fact, I feel it strange myself\\r\\nhow timid, chaste and modern she is with me!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you, of course, are developing her... he-he! trying to prove to her\\r\\nthat all that modesty is nonsense?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at all, not at all! How coarsely, how stupidly--excuse me saying\\r\\nso--you misunderstand the word development! Good heavens, how... crude\\r\\nyou still are! We are striving for the freedom of women and you have\\r\\nonly one idea in your head.... Setting aside the general question\\r\\nof chastity and feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeed\\r\\nprejudices, I fully accept her chastity with me, because that’s for her\\r\\nto decide. Of course if she were to tell me herself that she wanted me,\\r\\nI should think myself very lucky, because I like the girl very much; but\\r\\nas it is, no one has ever treated her more courteously than I, with more\\r\\nrespect for her dignity... I wait in hopes, that’s all!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You had much better make her a present of something. I bet you never\\r\\nthought of that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t understand, as I’ve told you already! Of course, she is in\\r\\nsuch a position, but it’s another question. Quite another question!\\r\\nYou simply despise her. Seeing a fact which you mistakenly consider\\r\\ndeserving of contempt, you refuse to take a humane view of a fellow\\r\\ncreature. You don’t know what a character she is! I am only sorry that\\r\\nof late she has quite given up reading and borrowing books. I used\\r\\nto lend them to her. I am sorry, too, that with all the energy and\\r\\nresolution in protesting--which she has already shown once--she has\\r\\nlittle self-reliance, little, so to say, independence, so as to\\r\\nbreak free from certain prejudices and certain foolish ideas. Yet she\\r\\nthoroughly understands some questions, for instance about kissing of\\r\\nhands, that is, that it’s an insult to a woman for a man to kiss her\\r\\nhand, because it’s a sign of inequality. We had a debate about it and\\r\\nI described it to her. She listened attentively to an account of the\\r\\nworkmen’s associations in France, too. Now I am explaining the question\\r\\nof coming into the room in the future society.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what’s that, pray?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We had a debate lately on the question: Has a member of the community\\r\\nthe right to enter another member’s room, whether man or woman, at any\\r\\ntime... and we decided that he has!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It might be at an inconvenient moment, he-he!”\\r\\n\\r\\nLebeziatnikov was really angry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are always thinking of something unpleasant,” he cried with\\r\\naversion. “Tfoo! How vexed I am that when I was expounding our system, I\\r\\nreferred prematurely to the question of personal privacy! It’s always\\r\\na stumbling-block to people like you, they turn it into ridicule before\\r\\nthey understand it. And how proud they are of it, too! Tfoo! I’ve often\\r\\nmaintained that that question should not be approached by a novice till\\r\\nhe has a firm faith in the system. And tell me, please, what do you\\r\\nfind so shameful even in cesspools? I should be the first to be ready\\r\\nto clean out any cesspool you like. And it’s not a question of\\r\\nself-sacrifice, it’s simply work, honourable, useful work which is\\r\\nas good as any other and much better than the work of a Raphael and a\\r\\nPushkin, because it is more useful.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And more honourable, more honourable, he-he-he!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean by ‘more honourable’? I don’t understand such\\r\\nexpressions to describe human activity. ‘More honourable,’ ‘nobler’--all\\r\\nthose are old-fashioned prejudices which I reject. Everything which is\\r\\n_of use_ to mankind is honourable. I only understand one word: _useful_!\\r\\nYou can snigger as much as you like, but that’s so!”\\r\\n\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch laughed heartily. He had finished counting the money\\r\\nand was putting it away. But some of the notes he left on the table. The\\r\\n“cesspool question” had already been a subject of dispute between them.\\r\\nWhat was absurd was that it made Lebeziatnikov really angry, while it\\r\\namused Luzhin and at that moment he particularly wanted to anger his\\r\\nyoung friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s your ill-luck yesterday that makes you so ill-humoured and\\r\\nannoying,” blurted out Lebeziatnikov, who in spite of his “independence”\\r\\n and his “protests” did not venture to oppose Pyotr Petrovitch and still\\r\\nbehaved to him with some of the respect habitual in earlier years.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’d better tell me this,” Pyotr Petrovitch interrupted with haughty\\r\\ndispleasure, “can you... or rather are you really friendly enough with\\r\\nthat young person to ask her to step in here for a minute? I think\\r\\nthey’ve all come back from the cemetery... I heard the sound of\\r\\nsteps... I want to see her, that young person.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What for?” Lebeziatnikov asked with surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I want to. I am leaving here to-day or to-morrow and therefore I\\r\\nwanted to speak to her about... However, you may be present during the\\r\\ninterview. It’s better you should be, indeed. For there’s no knowing\\r\\nwhat you might imagine.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shan’t imagine anything. I only asked and, if you’ve anything to say\\r\\nto her, nothing is easier than to call her in. I’ll go directly and you\\r\\nmay be sure I won’t be in your way.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFive minutes later Lebeziatnikov came in with Sonia. She came in very\\r\\nmuch surprised and overcome with shyness as usual. She was always shy in\\r\\nsuch circumstances and was always afraid of new people, she had been as\\r\\na child and was even more so now.... Pyotr Petrovitch met her “politely\\r\\nand affably,” but with a certain shade of bantering familiarity which in\\r\\nhis opinion was suitable for a man of his respectability and weight\\r\\nin dealing with a creature so young and so _interesting_ as she. He\\r\\nhastened to “reassure” her and made her sit down facing him at the\\r\\ntable. Sonia sat down, looked about her--at Lebeziatnikov, at the notes\\r\\nlying on the table and then again at Pyotr Petrovitch and her eyes\\r\\nremained riveted on him. Lebeziatnikov was moving to the door. Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch signed to Sonia to remain seated and stopped Lebeziatnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is Raskolnikov in there? Has he come?” he asked him in a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Raskolnikov? Yes. Why? Yes, he is there. I saw him just come in....\\r\\nWhy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I particularly beg you to remain here with us and not to leave\\r\\nme alone with this... young woman. I only want a few words with her,\\r\\nbut God knows what they may make of it. I shouldn’t like Raskolnikov to\\r\\nrepeat anything.... You understand what I mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I understand!” Lebeziatnikov saw the point. “Yes, you are right.... Of\\r\\ncourse, I am convinced personally that you have no reason to be uneasy,\\r\\nbut... still, you are right. Certainly I’ll stay. I’ll stand here at the\\r\\nwindow and not be in your way... I think you are right...”\\r\\n\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch returned to the sofa, sat down opposite Sonia, looked\\r\\nattentively at her and assumed an extremely dignified, even severe\\r\\nexpression, as much as to say, “don’t you make any mistake, madam.”\\r\\n Sonia was overwhelmed with embarrassment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the first place, Sofya Semyonovna, will you make my excuses to your\\r\\nrespected mamma.... That’s right, isn’t it? Katerina Ivanovna stands\\r\\nin the place of a mother to you?” Pyotr Petrovitch began with great\\r\\ndignity, though affably.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was evident that his intentions were friendly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so, yes; the place of a mother,” Sonia answered, timidly and\\r\\nhurriedly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then will you make my apologies to her? Through inevitable\\r\\ncircumstances I am forced to be absent and shall not be at the dinner in\\r\\nspite of your mamma’s kind invitation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes... I’ll tell her... at once.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Sonia hastily jumped up from her seat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait, that’s not all,” Pyotr Petrovitch detained her, smiling at her\\r\\nsimplicity and ignorance of good manners, “and you know me little, my\\r\\ndear Sofya Semyonovna, if you suppose I would have ventured to trouble\\r\\na person like you for a matter of so little consequence affecting myself\\r\\nonly. I have another object.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia sat down hurriedly. Her eyes rested again for an instant on the\\r\\ngrey-and-rainbow-coloured notes that remained on the table, but she\\r\\nquickly looked away and fixed her eyes on Pyotr Petrovitch. She felt it\\r\\nhorribly indecorous, especially for _her_, to look at another person’s\\r\\nmoney. She stared at the gold eye-glass which Pyotr Petrovitch held\\r\\nin his left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome ring with a\\r\\nyellow stone on his middle finger. But suddenly she looked away and, not\\r\\nknowing where to turn, ended by staring Pyotr Petrovitch again straight\\r\\nin the face. After a pause of still greater dignity he continued.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple of words with\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna, poor woman. That was sufficient to enable me to\\r\\nascertain that she is in a position--preternatural, if one may so\\r\\nexpress it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes... preternatural...” Sonia hurriedly assented.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say, ill.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, simpler and more comprehen... yes, ill.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. So then from a feeling of humanity and so to speak\\r\\ncompassion, I should be glad to be of service to her in any way,\\r\\nforeseeing her unfortunate position. I believe the whole of this\\r\\npoverty-stricken family depends now entirely on you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Allow me to ask,” Sonia rose to her feet, “did you say something to her\\r\\nyesterday of the possibility of a pension? Because she told me you had\\r\\nundertaken to get her one. Was that true?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not in the slightest, and indeed it’s an absurdity! I merely hinted at\\r\\nher obtaining temporary assistance as the widow of an official who had\\r\\ndied in the service--if only she has patronage... but apparently your\\r\\nlate parent had not served his full term and had not indeed been in the\\r\\nservice at all of late. In fact, if there could be any hope, it would be\\r\\nvery ephemeral, because there would be no claim for assistance in\\r\\nthat case, far from it.... And she is dreaming of a pension already,\\r\\nhe-he-he!... A go-ahead lady!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, she is. For she is credulous and good-hearted, and she believes\\r\\neverything from the goodness of her heart and... and... and she is like\\r\\nthat... yes... You must excuse her,” said Sonia, and again she got up to\\r\\ngo.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you haven’t heard what I have to say.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I haven’t heard,” muttered Sonia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then sit down.” She was terribly confused; she sat down again a third\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Seeing her position with her unfortunate little ones, I should be glad,\\r\\nas I have said before, so far as lies in my power, to be of service,\\r\\nthat is, so far as is in my power, not more. One might for instance get\\r\\nup a subscription for her, or a lottery, something of the sort, such as\\r\\nis always arranged in such cases by friends or even outsiders desirous\\r\\nof assisting people. It was of that I intended to speak to you; it might\\r\\nbe done.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes... God will repay you for it,” faltered Sonia, gazing intently\\r\\nat Pyotr Petrovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It might be, but we will talk of it later. We might begin it to-day, we\\r\\nwill talk it over this evening and lay the foundation so to speak. Come\\r\\nto me at seven o’clock. Mr. Lebeziatnikov, I hope, will assist us. But\\r\\nthere is one circumstance of which I ought to warn you beforehand and\\r\\nfor which I venture to trouble you, Sofya Semyonovna, to come here. In\\r\\nmy opinion money cannot be, indeed it’s unsafe to put it into Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna’s own hands. The dinner to-day is a proof of that. Though she\\r\\nhas not, so to speak, a crust of bread for to-morrow and... well, boots\\r\\nor shoes, or anything; she has bought to-day Jamaica rum, and even,\\r\\nI believe, Madeira and... and coffee. I saw it as I passed through.\\r\\nTo-morrow it will all fall upon you again, they won’t have a crust of\\r\\nbread. It’s absurd, really, and so, to my thinking, a subscription ought\\r\\nto be raised so that the unhappy widow should not know of the money, but\\r\\nonly you, for instance. Am I right?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know... this is only to-day, once in her life.... She was\\r\\nso anxious to do honour, to celebrate the memory.... And she is very\\r\\nsensible... but just as you think and I shall be very, very... they will\\r\\nall be... and God will reward... and the orphans...”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia burst into tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very well, then, keep it in mind; and now will you accept for the\\r\\nbenefit of your relation the small sum that I am able to spare, from me\\r\\npersonally. I am very anxious that my name should not be mentioned in\\r\\nconnection with it. Here... having so to speak anxieties of my own, I\\r\\ncannot do more...”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Pyotr Petrovitch held out to Sonia a ten-rouble note carefully\\r\\nunfolded. Sonia took it, flushed crimson, jumped up, muttered something\\r\\nand began taking leave. Pyotr Petrovitch accompanied her ceremoniously\\r\\nto the door. She got out of the room at last, agitated and distressed,\\r\\nand returned to Katerina Ivanovna, overwhelmed with confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this time Lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walked about the\\r\\nroom, anxious not to interrupt the conversation; when Sonia had gone he\\r\\nwalked up to Pyotr Petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I heard and _saw_ everything,” he said, laying stress on the last verb.\\r\\n“That is honourable, I mean to say, it’s humane! You wanted to avoid\\r\\ngratitude, I saw! And although I cannot, I confess, in principle\\r\\nsympathise with private charity, for it not only fails to eradicate the\\r\\nevil but even promotes it, yet I must admit that I saw your action with\\r\\npleasure--yes, yes, I like it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s all nonsense,” muttered Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted,\\r\\nlooking carefully at Lebeziatnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, it’s not nonsense! A man who has suffered distress and annoyance as\\r\\nyou did yesterday and who yet can sympathise with the misery of others,\\r\\nsuch a man... even though he is making a social mistake--is still\\r\\ndeserving of respect! I did not expect it indeed of you, Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch, especially as according to your ideas... oh, what a drawback\\r\\nyour ideas are to you! How distressed you are for instance by your\\r\\nill-luck yesterday,” cried the simple-hearted Lebeziatnikov, who felt\\r\\na return of affection for Pyotr Petrovitch. “And, what do you want with\\r\\nmarriage, with _legal_ marriage, my dear, noble Pyotr Petrovitch? Why do\\r\\nyou cling to this _legality_ of marriage? Well, you may beat me if you\\r\\nlike, but I am glad, positively glad it hasn’t come off, that you are\\r\\nfree, that you are not quite lost for humanity.... you see, I’ve spoken\\r\\nmy mind!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because I don’t want in your free marriage to be made a fool of and\\r\\nto bring up another man’s children, that’s why I want legal marriage,”\\r\\n Luzhin replied in order to make some answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed preoccupied by something.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Children? You referred to children,” Lebeziatnikov started off like\\r\\na warhorse at the trumpet call. “Children are a social question and a\\r\\nquestion of first importance, I agree; but the question of children has\\r\\nanother solution. Some refuse to have children altogether, because they\\r\\nsuggest the institution of the family. We’ll speak of children later,\\r\\nbut now as to the question of honour, I confess that’s my weak point.\\r\\nThat horrid, military, Pushkin expression is unthinkable in the\\r\\ndictionary of the future. What does it mean indeed? It’s nonsense,\\r\\nthere will be no deception in a free marriage! That is only the natural\\r\\nconsequence of a legal marriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest.\\r\\nSo that indeed it’s not humiliating... and if I ever, to suppose an\\r\\nabsurdity, were to be legally married, I should be positively glad of\\r\\nit. I should say to my wife: ‘My dear, hitherto I have loved you, now\\r\\nI respect you, for you’ve shown you can protest!’ You laugh! That’s\\r\\nbecause you are incapable of getting away from prejudices. Confound\\r\\nit all! I understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived\\r\\nin a legal marriage, but it’s simply a despicable consequence of a\\r\\ndespicable position in which both are humiliated. When the deception is\\r\\nopen, as in a free marriage, then it does not exist, it’s unthinkable.\\r\\nYour wife will only prove how she respects you by considering you\\r\\nincapable of opposing her happiness and avenging yourself on her for\\r\\nher new husband. Damn it all! I sometimes dream if I were to be married,\\r\\npfoo! I mean if I were to marry, legally or not, it’s just the same,\\r\\nI should present my wife with a lover if she had not found one for\\r\\nherself. ‘My dear,’ I should say, ‘I love you, but even more than that I\\r\\ndesire you to respect me. See!’ Am I not right?”\\r\\n\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch sniggered as he listened, but without much merriment.\\r\\nHe hardly heard it indeed. He was preoccupied with something else and\\r\\neven Lebeziatnikov at last noticed it. Pyotr Petrovitch seemed excited\\r\\nand rubbed his hands. Lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflected\\r\\nupon it afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the\\r\\nidea of that senseless dinner in Katerina Ivanovna’s disordered brain.\\r\\nNearly ten of the twenty roubles, given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladov’s\\r\\nfuneral, were wasted upon it. Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to\\r\\nhonour the memory of the deceased “suitably,” that all the lodgers,\\r\\nand still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know “that he was in no way their\\r\\ninferior, and perhaps very much their superior,” and that no one had the\\r\\nright “to turn up his nose at him.” Perhaps the chief element was that\\r\\npeculiar “poor man’s pride,” which compels many poor people to spend\\r\\ntheir last savings on some traditional social ceremony, simply in order\\r\\nto do “like other people,” and not to “be looked down upon.” It is very\\r\\nprobable, too, that Katerina Ivanovna longed on this occasion, at\\r\\nthe moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone, to show those\\r\\n“wretched contemptible lodgers” that she knew “how to do things, how\\r\\nto entertain” and that she had been brought up “in a genteel, she might\\r\\nalmost say aristocratic colonel’s family” and had not been meant for\\r\\nsweeping floors and washing the children’s rags at night. Even the\\r\\npoorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to these\\r\\nparoxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible\\r\\nnervous craving. And Katerina Ivanovna was not broken-spirited; she\\r\\nmight have been killed by circumstance, but her spirit could not have\\r\\nbeen broken, that is, she could not have been intimidated, her will\\r\\ncould not be crushed. Moreover Sonia had said with good reason that her\\r\\nmind was unhinged. She could not be said to be insane, but for a year\\r\\npast she had been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained.\\r\\nThe later stages of consumption are apt, doctors tell us, to affect the\\r\\nintellect.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no great variety of wines, nor was there Madeira; but wine\\r\\nthere was. There was vodka, rum and Lisbon wine, all of the poorest\\r\\nquality but in sufficient quantity. Besides the traditional rice and\\r\\nhoney, there were three or four dishes, one of which consisted of\\r\\npancakes, all prepared in Amalia Ivanovna’s kitchen. Two samovars were\\r\\nboiling, that tea and punch might be offered after dinner. Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions, with the help\\r\\nof one of the lodgers, an unfortunate little Pole who had somehow been\\r\\nstranded at Madame Lippevechsel’s. He promptly put himself at Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna’s disposal and had been all that morning and all the day before\\r\\nrunning about as fast as his legs could carry him, and very anxious\\r\\nthat everyone should be aware of it. For every trifle he ran to Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna, even hunting her out at the bazaar, at every instant called\\r\\nher “_Pani_.” She was heartily sick of him before the end, though\\r\\nshe had declared at first that she could not have got on without this\\r\\n“serviceable and magnanimous man.” It was one of Katerina Ivanovna’s\\r\\ncharacteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours.\\r\\nHer praises were so exaggerated as sometimes to be embarrassing; she\\r\\nwould invent various circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance\\r\\nand quite genuinely believe in their reality. Then all of a sudden she\\r\\nwould be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the\\r\\nperson she had only a few hours before been literally adoring. She\\r\\nwas naturally of a gay, lively and peace-loving disposition, but from\\r\\ncontinual failures and misfortunes she had come to desire so _keenly_\\r\\nthat all should live in peace and joy and should not _dare_ to break the\\r\\npeace, that the slightest jar, the smallest disaster reduced her almost\\r\\nto frenzy, and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hopes and\\r\\nfancies to cursing her fate and raving, and knocking her head against\\r\\nthe wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmalia Ivanovna, too, suddenly acquired extraordinary importance in\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna’s eyes and was treated by her with extraordinary\\r\\nrespect, probably only because Amalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heart\\r\\nand soul into the preparations. She had undertaken to lay the table,\\r\\nto provide the linen, crockery, etc., and to cook the dishes in her\\r\\nkitchen, and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hands and gone\\r\\nherself to the cemetery. Everything had been well done. Even the\\r\\ntable-cloth was nearly clean; the crockery, knives, forks and glasses\\r\\nwere, of course, of all shapes and patterns, lent by different lodgers,\\r\\nbut the table was properly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia Ivanovna,\\r\\nfeeling she had done her work well, had put on a black silk dress and\\r\\na cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some\\r\\npride. This pride, though justifiable, displeased Katerina Ivanovna for\\r\\nsome reason: “as though the table could not have been laid except by\\r\\nAmalia Ivanovna!” She disliked the cap with new ribbons, too. “Could she\\r\\nbe stuck up, the stupid German, because she was mistress of the house,\\r\\nand had consented as a favour to help her poor lodgers! As a favour!\\r\\nFancy that! Katerina Ivanovna’s father who had been a colonel and almost\\r\\na governor had sometimes had the table set for forty persons, and then\\r\\nanyone like Amalia Ivanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, would not have been\\r\\nallowed into the kitchen.”\\r\\n\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna, however, put off expressing her feelings for the\\r\\ntime and contented herself with treating her coldly, though she decided\\r\\ninwardly that she would certainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna down\\r\\nand set her in her proper place, for goodness only knew what she was\\r\\nfancying herself. Katerina Ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that\\r\\nhardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral, except\\r\\nthe Pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery, while to the\\r\\nmemorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned\\r\\nup, the wretched creatures, many of them not quite sober. The older\\r\\nand more respectable of them all, as if by common consent, stayed away.\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the most\\r\\nrespectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though Katerina Ivanovna\\r\\nhad the evening before told all the world, that is Amalia Ivanovna,\\r\\nPolenka, Sonia and the Pole, that he was the most generous,\\r\\nnoble-hearted man with a large property and vast connections, who had\\r\\nbeen a friend of her first husband’s, and a guest in her father’s\\r\\nhouse, and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her\\r\\na considerable pension. It must be noted that when Katerina Ivanovna\\r\\nexalted anyone’s connections and fortune, it was without any ulterior\\r\\nmotive, quite disinterestedly, for the mere pleasure of adding to\\r\\nthe consequence of the person praised. Probably “taking his cue” from\\r\\nLuzhin, “that contemptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up\\r\\neither. What did he fancy himself? He was only asked out of kindness\\r\\nand because he was sharing the same room with Pyotr Petrovitch and was a\\r\\nfriend of his, so that it would have been awkward not to invite him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong those who failed to appear were “the genteel lady and her\\r\\nold-maidish daughter,” who had only been lodgers in the house for the\\r\\nlast fortnight, but had several times complained of the noise and uproar\\r\\nin Katerina Ivanovna’s room, especially when Marmeladov had come\\r\\nback drunk. Katerina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who,\\r\\nquarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn the whole\\r\\nfamily out of doors, had shouted at her that they “were not worth the\\r\\nfoot” of the honourable lodgers whom they were disturbing. Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna determined now to invite this lady and her daughter, “whose\\r\\nfoot she was not worth,” and who had turned away haughtily when she\\r\\ncasually met them, so that they might know that “she was more noble in\\r\\nher thoughts and feelings and did not harbour malice,” and might see\\r\\nthat she was not accustomed to her way of living. She had proposed to\\r\\nmake this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her late father’s\\r\\ngovernorship, and also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly\\r\\nstupid of them to turn away on meeting her. The fat colonel-major (he\\r\\nwas really a discharged officer of low rank) was also absent, but it\\r\\nappeared that he had been “not himself” for the last two days. The party\\r\\nconsisted of the Pole, a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and\\r\\na greasy coat, who had not a word to say for himself, and smelt\\r\\nabominably, a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in the\\r\\npost office and who had been from immemorial ages maintained by someone\\r\\nat Amalia Ivanovna’s.\\r\\n\\r\\nA retired clerk of the commissariat department came, too; he was\\r\\ndrunk, had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy--was without\\r\\na waistcoat! One of the visitors sat straight down to the table without\\r\\neven greeting Katerina Ivanovna. Finally one person having no suit\\r\\nappeared in his dressing-gown, but this was too much, and the efforts of\\r\\nAmalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing him. The Pole brought\\r\\nwith him, however, two other Poles who did not live at Amalia Ivanovna’s\\r\\nand whom no one had seen here before. All this irritated Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna intensely. “For whom had they made all these preparations\\r\\nthen?” To make room for the visitors the children had not even been laid\\r\\nfor at the table; but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the\\r\\nfurthest corner with their dinner laid on a box, while Polenka as a big\\r\\ngirl had to look after them, feed them, and keep their noses wiped like\\r\\nwell-bred children’s.\\r\\n\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna, in fact, could hardly help meeting her guests with\\r\\nincreased dignity, and even haughtiness. She stared at some of them with\\r\\nspecial severity, and loftily invited them to take their seats. Rushing\\r\\nto the conclusion that Amalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those who\\r\\nwere absent, she began treating her with extreme nonchalance, which the\\r\\nlatter promptly observed and resented. Such a beginning was no good omen\\r\\nfor the end. All were seated at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the\\r\\ncemetery. Katerina Ivanovna was greatly delighted to see him, in the\\r\\nfirst place, because he was the one “educated visitor, and, as everyone\\r\\nknew, was in two years to take a professorship in the university,” and\\r\\nsecondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for having\\r\\nbeen unable to be at the funeral. She positively pounced upon him, and\\r\\nmade him sit on her left hand (Amalia Ivanovna was on her right). In\\r\\nspite of her continual anxiety that the dishes should be passed round\\r\\ncorrectly and that everyone should taste them, in spite of the agonising\\r\\ncough which interrupted her every minute and seemed to have grown worse\\r\\nduring the last few days, she hastened to pour out in a half whisper to\\r\\nRaskolnikov all her suppressed feelings and her just indignation at\\r\\nthe failure of the dinner, interspersing her remarks with lively and\\r\\nuncontrollable laughter at the expense of her visitors and especially of\\r\\nher landlady.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s all that cuckoo’s fault! You know whom I mean? Her, her!” Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna nodded towards the landlady. “Look at her, she’s making round\\r\\neyes, she feels that we are talking about her and can’t understand.\\r\\nPfoo, the owl! Ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) And what does she put on that\\r\\ncap for? (Cough-cough-cough.) Have you noticed that she wants everyone\\r\\nto consider that she is patronising me and doing me an honour by being\\r\\nhere? I asked her like a sensible woman to invite people, especially\\r\\nthose who knew my late husband, and look at the set of fools she has\\r\\nbrought! The sweeps! Look at that one with the spotty face. And those\\r\\nwretched Poles, ha-ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) Not one of them has ever\\r\\npoked his nose in here, I’ve never set eyes on them. What have they come\\r\\nhere for, I ask you? There they sit in a row. Hey, _pan_!” she cried\\r\\nsuddenly to one of them, “have you tasted the pancakes? Take some more!\\r\\nHave some beer! Won’t you have some vodka? Look, he’s jumped up and is\\r\\nmaking his bows, they must be quite starved, poor things. Never mind,\\r\\nlet them eat! They don’t make a noise, anyway, though I’m really afraid\\r\\nfor our landlady’s silver spoons... Amalia Ivanovna!” she addressed her\\r\\nsuddenly, almost aloud, “if your spoons should happen to be stolen,\\r\\nI won’t be responsible, I warn you! Ha-ha-ha!” She laughed turning to\\r\\nRaskolnikov, and again nodding towards the landlady, in high glee at her\\r\\nsally. “She didn’t understand, she didn’t understand again! Look how\\r\\nshe sits with her mouth open! An owl, a real owl! An owl in new ribbons,\\r\\nha-ha-ha!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHere her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing that\\r\\nlasted five minutes. Drops of perspiration stood out on her forehead\\r\\nand her handkerchief was stained with blood. She showed Raskolnikov\\r\\nthe blood in silence, and as soon as she could get her breath began\\r\\nwhispering to him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on her\\r\\ncheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know, I gave her the most delicate instructions, so to speak,\\r\\nfor inviting that lady and her daughter, you understand of whom I am\\r\\nspeaking? It needed the utmost delicacy, the greatest nicety, but she\\r\\nhas managed things so that that fool, that conceited baggage, that\\r\\nprovincial nonentity, simply because she is the widow of a major, and\\r\\nhas come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in the\\r\\ngovernment offices, because at fifty she paints her face (everybody\\r\\nknows it)... a creature like that did not think fit to come, and has\\r\\nnot even answered the invitation, which the most ordinary good manners\\r\\nrequired! I can’t understand why Pyotr Petrovitch has not come? But\\r\\nwhere’s Sonia? Where has she gone? Ah, there she is at last! what is it,\\r\\nSonia, where have you been? It’s odd that even at your father’s funeral\\r\\nyou should be so unpunctual. Rodion Romanovitch, make room for her\\r\\nbeside you. That’s your place, Sonia... take what you like. Have some of\\r\\nthe cold entrée with jelly, that’s the best. They’ll bring the pancakes\\r\\ndirectly. Have they given the children some? Polenka, have you got\\r\\neverything? (Cough-cough-cough.) That’s all right. Be a good girl, Lida,\\r\\nand, Kolya, don’t fidget with your feet; sit like a little gentleman.\\r\\nWhat are you saying, Sonia?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia hastened to give her Pyotr Petrovitch’s apologies, trying to\\r\\nspeak loud enough for everyone to hear and carefully choosing the most\\r\\nrespectful phrases which she attributed to Pyotr Petrovitch. She added\\r\\nthat Pyotr Petrovitch had particularly told her to say that, as soon as\\r\\nhe possibly could, he would come immediately to discuss _business_ alone\\r\\nwith her and to consider what could be done for her, etc., etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia knew that this would comfort Katerina Ivanovna, would flatter her\\r\\nand gratify her pride. She sat down beside Raskolnikov; she made him a\\r\\nhurried bow, glancing curiously at him. But for the rest of the time\\r\\nshe seemed to avoid looking at him or speaking to him. She seemed\\r\\nabsent-minded, though she kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna, trying\\r\\nto please her. Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna had been able to get\\r\\nmourning; Sonia was wearing dark brown, and Katerina Ivanovna had on her\\r\\nonly dress, a dark striped cotton one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe message from Pyotr Petrovitch was very successful. Listening to\\r\\nSonia with dignity, Katerina Ivanovna inquired with equal dignity how\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch was, then at once whispered almost aloud to\\r\\nRaskolnikov that it certainly would have been strange for a man of\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch’s position and standing to find himself in such\\r\\n“extraordinary company,” in spite of his devotion to her family and his\\r\\nold friendship with her father.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s why I am so grateful to you, Rodion Romanovitch, that you have\\r\\nnot disdained my hospitality, even in such surroundings,” she added\\r\\nalmost aloud. “But I am sure that it was only your special affection for\\r\\nmy poor husband that has made you keep your promise.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen once more with pride and dignity she scanned her visitors, and\\r\\nsuddenly inquired aloud across the table of the deaf man: “Wouldn’t he\\r\\nhave some more meat, and had he been given some wine?” The old man made\\r\\nno answer and for a long while could not understand what he was asked,\\r\\nthough his neighbours amused themselves by poking and shaking him. He\\r\\nsimply gazed about him with his mouth open, which only increased the\\r\\ngeneral mirth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What an imbecile! Look, look! Why was he brought? But as to Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch, I always had confidence in him,” Katerina Ivanovna\\r\\ncontinued, “and, of course, he is not like...” with an extremely stern\\r\\nface she addressed Amalia Ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter\\r\\nwas quite disconcerted, “not like your dressed up draggletails whom\\r\\nmy father would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen, and my late\\r\\nhusband would have done them honour if he had invited them in the\\r\\ngoodness of his heart.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, he was fond of drink, he was fond of it, he did drink!” cried the\\r\\ncommissariat clerk, gulping down his twelfth glass of vodka.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My late husband certainly had that weakness, and everyone knows\\r\\nit,” Katerina Ivanovna attacked him at once, “but he was a kind and\\r\\nhonourable man, who loved and respected his family. The worst of it was\\r\\nhis good nature made him trust all sorts of disreputable people, and he\\r\\ndrank with fellows who were not worth the sole of his shoe. Would you\\r\\nbelieve it, Rodion Romanovitch, they found a gingerbread cock in his\\r\\npocket; he was dead drunk, but he did not forget the children!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A cock? Did you say a cock?” shouted the commissariat clerk.\\r\\n\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply. She sighed, lost in\\r\\nthought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No doubt you think, like everyone, that I was too severe with him,” she\\r\\nwent on, addressing Raskolnikov. “But that’s not so! He respected me, he\\r\\nrespected me very much! He was a kind-hearted man! And how sorry I was\\r\\nfor him sometimes! He would sit in a corner and look at me, I used to\\r\\nfeel so sorry for him, I used to want to be kind to him and then would\\r\\nthink to myself: ‘Be kind to him and he will drink again,’ it was only\\r\\nby severity that you could keep him within bounds.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, he used to get his hair pulled pretty often,” roared the\\r\\ncommissariat clerk again, swallowing another glass of vodka.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Some fools would be the better for a good drubbing, as well as having\\r\\ntheir hair pulled. I am not talking of my late husband now!” Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna snapped at him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flush on her cheeks grew more and more marked, her chest heaved. In\\r\\nanother minute she would have been ready to make a scene. Many of the\\r\\nvisitors were sniggering, evidently delighted. They began poking the\\r\\ncommissariat clerk and whispering something to him. They were evidently\\r\\ntrying to egg him on.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Allow me to ask what are you alluding to,” began the clerk, “that is\\r\\nto say, whose... about whom... did you say just now... But I don’t care!\\r\\nThat’s nonsense! Widow! I forgive you.... Pass!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he took another drink of vodka.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov sat in silence, listening with disgust. He only ate from\\r\\npoliteness, just tasting the food that Katerina Ivanovna was continually\\r\\nputting on his plate, to avoid hurting her feelings. He watched Sonia\\r\\nintently. But Sonia became more and more anxious and distressed; she,\\r\\ntoo, foresaw that the dinner would not end peaceably, and saw with\\r\\nterror Katerina Ivanovna’s growing irritation. She knew that she, Sonia,\\r\\nwas the chief reason for the ‘genteel’ ladies’ contemptuous treatment of\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna’s invitation. She had heard from Amalia Ivanovna that\\r\\nthe mother was positively offended at the invitation and had asked the\\r\\nquestion: “How could she let her daughter sit down beside _that young\\r\\nperson_?” Sonia had a feeling that Katerina Ivanovna had already heard\\r\\nthis and an insult to Sonia meant more to Katerina Ivanovna than an\\r\\ninsult to herself, her children, or her father, Sonia knew that\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna would not be satisfied now, “till she had shown those\\r\\ndraggletails that they were both...” To make matters worse someone\\r\\npassed Sonia, from the other end of the table, a plate with two hearts\\r\\npierced with an arrow, cut out of black bread. Katerina Ivanovna flushed\\r\\ncrimson and at once said aloud across the table that the man who sent it\\r\\nwas “a drunken ass!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAmalia Ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss, and at the same time\\r\\ndeeply wounded by Katerina Ivanovna’s haughtiness, and to restore the\\r\\ngood-humour of the company and raise herself in their esteem she began,\\r\\napropos of nothing, telling a story about an acquaintance of hers “Karl\\r\\nfrom the chemist’s,” who was driving one night in a cab, and that “the\\r\\ncabman wanted him to kill, and Karl very much begged him not to kill,\\r\\nand wept and clasped hands, and frightened and from fear pierced his\\r\\nheart.” Though Katerina Ivanovna smiled, she observed at once that\\r\\nAmalia Ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter was\\r\\nstill more offended, and she retorted that her “_Vater aus Berlin_ was a\\r\\nvery important man, and always went with his hands in pockets.” Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna could not restrain herself and laughed so much that Amalia\\r\\nIvanovna lost patience and could scarcely control herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen to the owl!” Katerina Ivanovna whispered at once, her\\r\\ngood-humour almost restored, “she meant to say he kept his hands in\\r\\nhis pockets, but she said he put his hands in people’s pockets.\\r\\n(Cough-cough.) And have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that all these\\r\\nPetersburg foreigners, the Germans especially, are all stupider than\\r\\nwe! Can you fancy anyone of us telling how ‘Karl from the chemist’s’\\r\\n‘pierced his heart from fear’ and that the idiot, instead of punishing\\r\\nthe cabman, ‘clasped his hands and wept, and much begged.’ Ah, the fool!\\r\\nAnd you know she fancies it’s very touching and does not suspect how\\r\\nstupid she is! To my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great\\r\\ndeal cleverer, anyway one can see that he has addled his brains with\\r\\ndrink, but you know, these foreigners are always so well behaved\\r\\nand serious.... Look how she sits glaring! She is angry, ha-ha!\\r\\n(Cough-cough-cough.)”\\r\\n\\r\\nRegaining her good-humour, Katerina Ivanovna began at once telling\\r\\nRaskolnikov that when she had obtained her pension, she intended to open\\r\\na school for the daughters of gentlemen in her native town T----.\\r\\nThis was the first time she had spoken to him of the project, and she\\r\\nlaunched out into the most alluring details. It suddenly appeared that\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of honour of\\r\\nwhich Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov in the tavern, when he told\\r\\nhim that Katerina Ivanovna, his wife, had danced the shawl dance\\r\\nbefore the governor and other great personages on leaving school. This\\r\\ncertificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna’s right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed herself\\r\\nwith it chiefly with the object of overwhelming “those two stuck-up\\r\\ndraggletails” if they came to the dinner, and proving incontestably\\r\\nthat Katerina Ivanovna was of the most noble, “she might even say\\r\\naristocratic family, a colonel’s daughter and was far superior to\\r\\ncertain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore of late.” The\\r\\ncertificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of the drunken\\r\\nguests, and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to retain it, for it actually\\r\\ncontained the statement _en toutes lettres_, that her father was of the\\r\\nrank of a major, and also a companion of an order, so that she really\\r\\nwas almost the daughter of a colonel.\\r\\n\\r\\nWarming up, Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and\\r\\nhappy life they would lead in T----, on the gymnasium teachers whom\\r\\nshe would engage to give lessons in her boarding-school, one a most\\r\\nrespectable old Frenchman, one Mangot, who had taught Katerina Ivanovna\\r\\nherself in old days and was still living in T----, and would no doubt\\r\\nteach in her school on moderate terms. Next she spoke of Sonia who would\\r\\ngo with her to T---- and help her in all her plans. At this someone at\\r\\nthe further end of the table gave a sudden guffaw.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of\\r\\nit, she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction of\\r\\nSonia’s undoubted ability to assist her, of “her gentleness, patience,\\r\\ndevotion, generosity and good education,” tapping Sonia on the cheek and\\r\\nkissing her warmly twice. Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina Ivanovna\\r\\nsuddenly burst into tears, immediately observing that she was “nervous\\r\\nand silly, that she was too much upset, that it was time to finish, and\\r\\nas the dinner was over, it was time to hand round the tea.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment, Amalia Ivanovna, deeply aggrieved at taking no part in\\r\\nthe conversation, and not being listened to, made one last effort,\\r\\nand with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty\\r\\nobservation, that “in the future boarding-school she would have to pay\\r\\nparticular attention to _die Wäsche_, and that there certainly must be a\\r\\ngood _dame_ to look after the linen, and secondly that the young ladies\\r\\nmust not novels at night read.”\\r\\n\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna, who certainly was upset and very tired, as well as\\r\\nheartily sick of the dinner, at once cut short Amalia Ivanovna, saying\\r\\n“she knew nothing about it and was talking nonsense, that it was the\\r\\nbusiness of the laundry maid, and not of the directress of a high-class\\r\\nboarding-school to look after _die Wäsche_, and as for novel-reading,\\r\\nthat was simply rudeness, and she begged her to be silent.” Amalia\\r\\nIvanovna fired up and getting angry observed that she only “meant her\\r\\ngood,” and that “she had meant her very good,” and that “it was long\\r\\nsince she had paid her _gold_ for the lodgings.”\\r\\n\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna at once “set her down,” saying that it was a lie to\\r\\nsay she wished her good, because only yesterday when her dead husband\\r\\nwas lying on the table, she had worried her about the lodgings. To this\\r\\nAmalia Ivanovna very appropriately observed that she had invited those\\r\\nladies, but “those ladies had not come, because those ladies _are_\\r\\nladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady.” Katerina Ivanovna\\r\\nat once pointed out to her, that as she was a slut she could not judge\\r\\nwhat made one really a lady. Amalia Ivanovna at once declared that her\\r\\n“_Vater aus Berlin_ was a very, very important man, and both hands in\\r\\npockets went, and always used to say: ‘Poof! poof!’” and she leapt\\r\\nup from the table to represent her father, sticking her hands in her\\r\\npockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering vague sounds resembling “poof!\\r\\npoof!” amid loud laughter from all the lodgers, who purposely encouraged\\r\\nAmalia Ivanovna, hoping for a fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she at once declared,\\r\\nso that all could hear, that Amalia Ivanovna probably never had a\\r\\nfather, but was simply a drunken Petersburg Finn, and had certainly once\\r\\nbeen a cook and probably something worse. Amalia Ivanovna turned as red\\r\\nas a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna never had a\\r\\nfather, “but she had a _Vater aus Berlin_ and that he wore a long coat\\r\\nand always said poof-poof-poof!”\\r\\n\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that all knew what her family\\r\\nwas and that on that very certificate of honour it was stated in print\\r\\nthat her father was a colonel, while Amalia Ivanovna’s father--if she\\r\\nreally had one--was probably some Finnish milkman, but that probably she\\r\\nnever had a father at all, since it was still uncertain whether her name\\r\\nwas Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this Amalia Ivanovna, lashed to fury, struck the table with her fist,\\r\\nand shrieked that she was Amalia Ivanovna, and not Ludwigovna, “that\\r\\nher _Vater_ was named Johann and that he was a burgomeister, and that\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna’s _Vater_ was quite never a burgomeister.” Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna rose from her chair, and with a stern and apparently calm voice\\r\\n(though she was pale and her chest was heaving) observed that “if she\\r\\ndared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a\\r\\nlevel with her papa, she, Katerina Ivanovna, would tear her cap off her\\r\\nhead and trample it under foot.” Amalia Ivanovna ran about the room,\\r\\nshouting at the top of her voice, that she was mistress of the house and\\r\\nthat Katerina Ivanovna should leave the lodgings that minute; then she\\r\\nrushed for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table.\\r\\nThere was a great outcry and uproar, the children began crying. Sonia\\r\\nran to restrain Katerina Ivanovna, but when Amalia Ivanovna shouted\\r\\nsomething about “the yellow ticket,” Katerina Ivanovna pushed Sonia\\r\\naway, and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that minute the door opened, and Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin appeared\\r\\non the threshold. He stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant\\r\\neyes. Katerina Ivanovna rushed to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pyotr Petrovitch,” she cried, “protect me... you at least! Make this\\r\\nfoolish woman understand that she can’t behave like this to a lady in\\r\\nmisfortune... that there is a law for such things.... I’ll go to the\\r\\ngovernor-general himself.... She shall answer for it.... Remembering my\\r\\nfather’s hospitality protect these orphans.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Allow me, madam.... Allow me.” Pyotr Petrovitch waved her off. “Your\\r\\npapa as you are well aware I had not the honour of knowing” (someone\\r\\nlaughed aloud) “and I do not intend to take part in your everlasting\\r\\nsquabbles with Amalia Ivanovna.... I have come here to speak of my own\\r\\naffairs... and I want to have a word with your stepdaughter, Sofya...\\r\\nIvanovna, I think it is? Allow me to pass.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch, edging by her, went to the opposite corner where Sonia\\r\\nwas.\\r\\n\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna remained standing where she was, as though\\r\\nthunderstruck. She could not understand how Pyotr Petrovitch could deny\\r\\nhaving enjoyed her father’s hospitality. Though she had invented it\\r\\nherself, she believed in it firmly by this time. She was struck too\\r\\nby the businesslike, dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch. All the clamour gradually died away at his entrance. Not\\r\\nonly was this “serious business man” strikingly incongruous with the\\r\\nrest of the party, but it was evident, too, that he had come upon some\\r\\nmatter of consequence, that some exceptional cause must have brought him\\r\\nand that therefore something was going to happen. Raskolnikov, standing\\r\\nbeside Sonia, moved aside to let him pass; Pyotr Petrovitch did not\\r\\nseem to notice him. A minute later Lebeziatnikov, too, appeared in the\\r\\ndoorway; he did not come in, but stood still, listening with marked\\r\\ninterest, almost wonder, and seemed for a time perplexed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me for possibly interrupting you, but it’s a matter of\\r\\nsome importance,” Pyotr Petrovitch observed, addressing the company\\r\\ngenerally. “I am glad indeed to find other persons present. Amalia\\r\\nIvanovna, I humbly beg you as mistress of the house to pay careful\\r\\nattention to what I have to say to Sofya Ivanovna. Sofya Ivanovna,”\\r\\n he went on, addressing Sonia, who was very much surprised and already\\r\\nalarmed, “immediately after your visit I found that a hundred-rouble\\r\\nnote was missing from my table, in the room of my friend Mr.\\r\\nLebeziatnikov. If in any way whatever you know and will tell us where\\r\\nit is now, I assure you on my word of honour and call all present to\\r\\nwitness that the matter shall end there. In the opposite case I shall be\\r\\ncompelled to have recourse to very serious measures and then... you must\\r\\nblame yourself.”\\r\\n\\r\\nComplete silence reigned in the room. Even the crying children were\\r\\nstill. Sonia stood deadly pale, staring at Luzhin and unable to say a\\r\\nword. She seemed not to understand. Some seconds passed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, how is it to be then?” asked Luzhin, looking intently at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know.... I know nothing about it,” Sonia articulated faintly at\\r\\nlast.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, you know nothing?” Luzhin repeated and again he paused for some\\r\\nseconds. “Think a moment, mademoiselle,” he began severely, but still,\\r\\nas it were, admonishing her. “Reflect, I am prepared to give you time\\r\\nfor consideration. Kindly observe this: if I were not so entirely\\r\\nconvinced I should not, you may be sure, with my experience venture to\\r\\naccuse you so directly. Seeing that for such direct accusation before\\r\\nwitnesses, if false or even mistaken, I should myself in a certain sense\\r\\nbe made responsible, I am aware of that. This morning I changed for\\r\\nmy own purposes several five-per-cent securities for the sum of\\r\\napproximately three thousand roubles. The account is noted down in my\\r\\npocket-book. On my return home I proceeded to count the money--as Mr.\\r\\nLebeziatnikov will bear witness--and after counting two thousand three\\r\\nhundred roubles I put the rest in my pocket-book in my coat pocket.\\r\\nAbout five hundred roubles remained on the table and among them three\\r\\nnotes of a hundred roubles each. At that moment you entered (at my\\r\\ninvitation)--and all the time you were present you were exceedingly\\r\\nembarrassed; so that three times you jumped up in the middle of the\\r\\nconversation and tried to make off. Mr. Lebeziatnikov can bear witness\\r\\nto this. You yourself, mademoiselle, probably will not refuse to confirm\\r\\nmy statement that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, solely in\\r\\norder to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute position of your\\r\\nrelative, Katerina Ivanovna (whose dinner I was unable to attend),\\r\\nand the advisability of getting up something of the nature of a\\r\\nsubscription, lottery or the like, for her benefit. You thanked me and\\r\\neven shed tears. I describe all this as it took place, primarily to\\r\\nrecall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest\\r\\ndetail has escaped my recollection. Then I took a ten-rouble note from\\r\\nthe table and handed it to you by way of first instalment on my part\\r\\nfor the benefit of your relative. Mr. Lebeziatnikov saw all this. Then\\r\\nI accompanied you to the door--you being still in the same state of\\r\\nembarrassment--after which, being left alone with Mr. Lebeziatnikov I\\r\\ntalked to him for ten minutes--then Mr. Lebeziatnikov went out and I\\r\\nreturned to the table with the money lying on it, intending to count\\r\\nit and to put it aside, as I proposed doing before. To my surprise one\\r\\nhundred-rouble note had disappeared. Kindly consider the position.\\r\\nMr. Lebeziatnikov I cannot suspect. I am ashamed to allude to such\\r\\na supposition. I cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning, for the\\r\\nminute before your entrance I had finished my accounts and found the\\r\\ntotal correct. You will admit that recollecting your embarrassment, your\\r\\neagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your hands for some\\r\\ntime on the table, and taking into consideration your social position\\r\\nand the habits associated with it, I was, so to say, with horror and\\r\\npositively against my will, _compelled_ to entertain a suspicion--a\\r\\ncruel, but justifiable suspicion! I will add further and repeat that in\\r\\nspite of my positive conviction, I realise that I run a certain risk in\\r\\nmaking this accusation, but as you see, I could not let it pass. I have\\r\\ntaken action and I will tell you why: solely, madam, solely, owing\\r\\nto your black ingratitude! Why! I invite you for the benefit of your\\r\\ndestitute relative, I present you with my donation of ten roubles and\\r\\nyou, on the spot, repay me for all that with such an action. It is too\\r\\nbad! You need a lesson. Reflect! Moreover, like a true friend I beg\\r\\nyou--and you could have no better friend at this moment--think what you\\r\\nare doing, otherwise I shall be immovable! Well, what do you say?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have taken nothing,” Sonia whispered in terror, “you gave me ten\\r\\nroubles, here it is, take it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket, untied a corner of it,\\r\\ntook out the ten-rouble note and gave it to Luzhin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the hundred roubles you do not confess to taking?” he insisted\\r\\nreproachfully, not taking the note.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia looked about her. All were looking at her with such awful, stern,\\r\\nironical, hostile eyes. She looked at Raskolnikov... he stood against\\r\\nthe wall, with his arms crossed, looking at her with glowing eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good God!” broke from Sonia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Amalia Ivanovna, we shall have to send word to the police and therefore\\r\\nI humbly beg you meanwhile to send for the house porter,” Luzhin said\\r\\nsoftly and even kindly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Gott der Barmherzige_! I knew she was the thief,” cried Amalia\\r\\nIvanovna, throwing up her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You knew it?” Luzhin caught her up, “then I suppose you had some reason\\r\\nbefore this for thinking so. I beg you, worthy Amalia Ivanovna, to\\r\\nremember your words which have been uttered before witnesses.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides. All were in\\r\\nmovement.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, suddenly realising the position, and\\r\\nshe rushed at Luzhin. “What! You accuse her of stealing? Sonia? Ah, the\\r\\nwretches, the wretches!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd running to Sonia she flung her wasted arms round her and held her as\\r\\nin a vise.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sonia! how dared you take ten roubles from him? Foolish girl! Give it\\r\\nto me! Give me the ten roubles at once--here!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd snatching the note from Sonia, Katerina Ivanovna crumpled it up and\\r\\nflung it straight into Luzhin’s face. It hit him in the eye and fell\\r\\non the ground. Amalia Ivanovna hastened to pick it up. Pyotr Petrovitch\\r\\nlost his temper.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hold that mad woman!” he shouted.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment several other persons, besides Lebeziatnikov, appeared in\\r\\nthe doorway, among them the two ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What! Mad? Am I mad? Idiot!” shrieked Katerina Ivanovna. “You are an\\r\\nidiot yourself, pettifogging lawyer, base man! Sonia, Sonia take his\\r\\nmoney! Sonia a thief! Why, she’d give away her last penny!” and Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna broke into hysterical laughter. “Did you ever see such an\\r\\nidiot?” she turned from side to side. “And you too?” she suddenly saw\\r\\nthe landlady, “and you too, sausage eater, you declare that she is a\\r\\nthief, you trashy Prussian hen’s leg in a crinoline! She hasn’t been\\r\\nout of this room: she came straight from you, you wretch, and sat down\\r\\nbeside me, everyone saw her. She sat here, by Rodion Romanovitch. Search\\r\\nher! Since she’s not left the room, the money would have to be on her!\\r\\nSearch her, search her! But if you don’t find it, then excuse me, my\\r\\ndear fellow, you’ll answer for it! I’ll go to our Sovereign, to our\\r\\nSovereign, to our gracious Tsar himself, and throw myself at his feet,\\r\\nto-day, this minute! I am alone in the world! They would let me in! Do\\r\\nyou think they wouldn’t? You’re wrong, I will get in! I will get in!\\r\\nYou reckoned on her meekness! You relied upon that! But I am not so\\r\\nsubmissive, let me tell you! You’ve gone too far yourself. Search her,\\r\\nsearch her!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Katerina Ivanovna in a frenzy shook Luzhin and dragged him towards\\r\\nSonia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am ready, I’ll be responsible... but calm yourself, madam, calm\\r\\nyourself. I see that you are not so submissive!... Well, well, but as to\\r\\nthat...” Luzhin muttered, “that ought to be before the police... though\\r\\nindeed there are witnesses enough as it is.... I am ready.... But in\\r\\nany case it’s difficult for a man... on account of her sex.... But with\\r\\nthe help of Amalia Ivanovna... though, of course, it’s not the way to do\\r\\nthings.... How is it to be done?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As you will! Let anyone who likes search her!” cried Katerina Ivanovna.\\r\\n“Sonia, turn out your pockets! See! Look, monster, the pocket is empty,\\r\\nhere was her handkerchief! Here is the other pocket, look! D’you see,\\r\\nd’you see?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Katerina Ivanovna turned--or rather snatched--both pockets inside\\r\\nout. But from the right pocket a piece of paper flew out and describing\\r\\na parabola in the air fell at Luzhin’s feet. Everyone saw it, several\\r\\ncried out. Pyotr Petrovitch stooped down, picked up the paper in two\\r\\nfingers, lifted it where all could see it and opened it. It was a\\r\\nhundred-rouble note folded in eight. Pyotr Petrovitch held up the note\\r\\nshowing it to everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thief! Out of my lodging. Police, police!” yelled Amalia Ivanovna.\\r\\n“They must to Siberia be sent! Away!”\\r\\n\\r\\nExclamations arose on all sides. Raskolnikov was silent, keeping his\\r\\neyes fixed on Sonia, except for an occasional rapid glance at Luzhin.\\r\\nSonia stood still, as though unconscious. She was hardly able to feel\\r\\nsurprise. Suddenly the colour rushed to her cheeks; she uttered a cry\\r\\nand hid her face in her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, it wasn’t I! I didn’t take it! I know nothing about it,” she cried\\r\\nwith a heartrending wail, and she ran to Katerina Ivanovna, who clasped\\r\\nher tightly in her arms, as though she would shelter her from all the\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sonia! Sonia! I don’t believe it! You see, I don’t believe it!” she\\r\\ncried in the face of the obvious fact, swaying her to and fro in her\\r\\narms like a baby, kissing her face continually, then snatching at her\\r\\nhands and kissing them, too, “you took it! How stupid these people are!\\r\\nOh dear! You are fools, fools,” she cried, addressing the whole room,\\r\\n“you don’t know, you don’t know what a heart she has, what a girl she\\r\\nis! She take it, she? She’d sell her last rag, she’d go barefoot to help\\r\\nyou if you needed it, that’s what she is! She has the yellow passport\\r\\nbecause my children were starving, she sold herself for us! Ah, husband,\\r\\nhusband! Do you see? Do you see? What a memorial dinner for you!\\r\\nMerciful heavens! Defend her, why are you all standing still? Rodion\\r\\nRomanovitch, why don’t you stand up for her? Do you believe it, too? You\\r\\nare not worth her little finger, all of you together! Good God! Defend\\r\\nher now, at least!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wail of the poor, consumptive, helpless woman seemed to produce a\\r\\ngreat effect on her audience. The agonised, wasted, consumptive face,\\r\\nthe parched blood-stained lips, the hoarse voice, the tears unrestrained\\r\\nas a child’s, the trustful, childish and yet despairing prayer for help\\r\\nwere so piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her. Pyotr Petrovitch\\r\\nat any rate was at once moved to _compassion_.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Madam, madam, this incident does not reflect upon you!” he cried\\r\\nimpressively, “no one would take upon himself to accuse you of being an\\r\\ninstigator or even an accomplice in it, especially as you have proved\\r\\nher guilt by turning out her pockets, showing that you had no previous\\r\\nidea of it. I am most ready, most ready to show compassion, if poverty,\\r\\nso to speak, drove Sofya Semyonovna to it, but why did you refuse to\\r\\nconfess, mademoiselle? Were you afraid of the disgrace? The first step?\\r\\nYou lost your head, perhaps? One can quite understand it.... But how\\r\\ncould you have lowered yourself to such an action? Gentlemen,” he\\r\\naddressed the whole company, “gentlemen! Compassionate and, so to say,\\r\\ncommiserating these people, I am ready to overlook it even now in spite\\r\\nof the personal insult lavished upon me! And may this disgrace be a\\r\\nlesson to you for the future,” he said, addressing Sonia, “and I will\\r\\ncarry the matter no further. Enough!”\\r\\n\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch stole a glance at Raskolnikov. Their eyes met, and the\\r\\nfire in Raskolnikov’s seemed ready to reduce him to ashes. Meanwhile\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna apparently heard nothing. She was kissing and hugging\\r\\nSonia like a madwoman. The children, too, were embracing Sonia on\\r\\nall sides, and Polenka--though she did not fully understand what was\\r\\nwrong--was drowned in tears and shaking with sobs, as she hid her pretty\\r\\nlittle face, swollen with weeping, on Sonia’s shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How vile!” a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway.\\r\\n\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch looked round quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What vileness!” Lebeziatnikov repeated, staring him straight in the\\r\\nface.\\r\\n\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch gave a positive start--all noticed it and recalled it\\r\\nafterwards. Lebeziatnikov strode into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you dared to call me as witness?” he said, going up to Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean? What are you talking about?” muttered Luzhin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I mean that you... are a slanderer, that’s what my words mean!”\\r\\n Lebeziatnikov said hotly, looking sternly at him with his short-sighted\\r\\neyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was extremely angry. Raskolnikov gazed intently at him, as though\\r\\nseizing and weighing each word. Again there was a silence. Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you mean that for me,...” he began, stammering. “But what’s the\\r\\nmatter with you? Are you out of your mind?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m in my mind, but you are a scoundrel! Ah, how vile! I have heard\\r\\neverything. I kept waiting on purpose to understand it, for I must own\\r\\neven now it is not quite logical.... What you have done it all for I\\r\\ncan’t understand.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, what have I done then? Give over talking in your nonsensical\\r\\nriddles! Or maybe you are drunk!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You may be a drunkard, perhaps, vile man, but I am not! I never touch\\r\\nvodka, for it’s against my convictions. Would you believe it, he, he\\r\\nhimself, with his own hands gave Sofya Semyonovna that hundred-rouble\\r\\nnote--I saw it, I was a witness, I’ll take my oath! He did it, he!”\\r\\n repeated Lebeziatnikov, addressing all.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you crazy, milksop?” squealed Luzhin. “She is herself before\\r\\nyou--she herself here declared just now before everyone that I gave her\\r\\nonly ten roubles. How could I have given it to her?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I saw it, I saw it,” Lebeziatnikov repeated, “and though it is against\\r\\nmy principles, I am ready this very minute to take any oath you like\\r\\nbefore the court, for I saw how you slipped it in her pocket. Only\\r\\nlike a fool I thought you did it out of kindness! When you were saying\\r\\ngood-bye to her at the door, while you held her hand in one hand, with\\r\\nthe other, the left, you slipped the note into her pocket. I saw it, I\\r\\nsaw it!”\\r\\n\\r\\nLuzhin turned pale.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What lies!” he cried impudently, “why, how could you, standing by the\\r\\nwindow, see the note? You fancied it with your short-sighted eyes. You\\r\\nare raving!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I didn’t fancy it. And though I was standing some way off, I saw\\r\\nit all. And though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note from\\r\\nthe window--that’s true--I knew for certain that it was a hundred-rouble\\r\\nnote, because, when you were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles,\\r\\nyou took up from the table a hundred-rouble note (I saw it because I\\r\\nwas standing near then, and an idea struck me at once, so that I did not\\r\\nforget you had it in your hand). You folded it and kept it in your hand\\r\\nall the time. I didn’t think of it again until, when you were getting\\r\\nup, you changed it from your right hand to your left and nearly dropped\\r\\nit! I noticed it because the same idea struck me again, that you meant\\r\\nto do her a kindness without my seeing. You can fancy how I watched you\\r\\nand I saw how you succeeded in slipping it into her pocket. I saw it, I\\r\\nsaw it, I’ll take my oath.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLebeziatnikov was almost breathless. Exclamations arose on all hands\\r\\nchiefly expressive of wonder, but some were menacing in tone. They all\\r\\ncrowded round Pyotr Petrovitch. Katerina Ivanovna flew to Lebeziatnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was mistaken in you! Protect her! You are the only one to take her\\r\\npart! She is an orphan. God has sent you!”\\r\\n\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna, hardly knowing what she was doing, sank on her knees\\r\\nbefore him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A pack of nonsense!” yelled Luzhin, roused to fury, “it’s all nonsense\\r\\nyou’ve been talking! ‘An idea struck you, you didn’t think, you\\r\\nnoticed’--what does it amount to? So I gave it to her on the sly on\\r\\npurpose? What for? With what object? What have I to do with this...?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What for? That’s what I can’t understand, but that what I am telling\\r\\nyou is the fact, that’s certain! So far from my being mistaken, you\\r\\ninfamous criminal man, I remember how, on account of it, a question\\r\\noccurred to me at once, just when I was thanking you and pressing\\r\\nyour hand. What made you put it secretly in her pocket? Why you did it\\r\\nsecretly, I mean? Could it be simply to conceal it from me, knowing that\\r\\nmy convictions are opposed to yours and that I do not approve of private\\r\\nbenevolence, which effects no radical cure? Well, I decided that you\\r\\nreally were ashamed of giving such a large sum before me. Perhaps,\\r\\ntoo, I thought, he wants to give her a surprise, when she finds a whole\\r\\nhundred-rouble note in her pocket. (For I know, some benevolent people\\r\\nare very fond of decking out their charitable actions in that way.) Then\\r\\nthe idea struck me, too, that you wanted to test her, to see whether,\\r\\nwhen she found it, she would come to thank you. Then, too, that you\\r\\nwanted to avoid thanks and that, as the saying is, your right hand\\r\\nshould not know... something of that sort, in fact. I thought of so\\r\\nmany possibilities that I put off considering it, but still thought it\\r\\nindelicate to show you that I knew your secret. But another idea struck\\r\\nme again that Sofya Semyonovna might easily lose the money before she\\r\\nnoticed it, that was why I decided to come in here to call her out of\\r\\nthe room and to tell her that you put a hundred roubles in her pocket.\\r\\nBut on my way I went first to Madame Kobilatnikov’s to take them the\\r\\n‘General Treatise on the Positive Method’ and especially to recommend\\r\\nPiderit’s article (and also Wagner’s); then I come on here and what a\\r\\nstate of things I find! Now could I, could I, have all these ideas and\\r\\nreflections if I had not seen you put the hundred-rouble note in her\\r\\npocket?”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Lebeziatnikov finished his long-winded harangue with the logical\\r\\ndeduction at the end, he was quite tired, and the perspiration streamed\\r\\nfrom his face. He could not, alas, even express himself correctly\\r\\nin Russian, though he knew no other language, so that he was quite\\r\\nexhausted, almost emaciated after this heroic exploit. But his speech\\r\\nproduced a powerful effect. He had spoken with such vehemence, with such\\r\\nconviction that everyone obviously believed him. Pyotr Petrovitch felt\\r\\nthat things were going badly with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you?” he shouted,\\r\\n“that’s no evidence. You may have dreamt it, that’s all! And I tell you,\\r\\nyou are lying, sir. You are lying and slandering from some spite against\\r\\nme, simply from pique, because I did not agree with your free-thinking,\\r\\ngodless, social propositions!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this retort did not benefit Pyotr Petrovitch. Murmurs of disapproval\\r\\nwere heard on all sides.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, that’s your line now, is it!” cried Lebeziatnikov, “that’s\\r\\nnonsense! Call the police and I’ll take my oath! There’s only one thing\\r\\nI can’t understand: what made him risk such a contemptible action. Oh,\\r\\npitiful, despicable man!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can explain why he risked such an action, and if necessary, I, too,\\r\\nwill swear to it,” Raskolnikov said at last in a firm voice, and he\\r\\nstepped forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe appeared to be firm and composed. Everyone felt clearly, from the\\r\\nvery look of him that he really knew about it and that the mystery would\\r\\nbe solved.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now I can explain it all to myself,” said Raskolnikov, addressing\\r\\nLebeziatnikov. “From the very beginning of the business, I suspected\\r\\nthat there was some scoundrelly intrigue at the bottom of it. I began\\r\\nto suspect it from some special circumstances known to me only, which\\r\\nI will explain at once to everyone: they account for everything. Your\\r\\nvaluable evidence has finally made everything clear to me. I beg all,\\r\\nall to listen. This gentleman (he pointed to Luzhin) was recently\\r\\nengaged to be married to a young lady--my sister, Avdotya Romanovna\\r\\nRaskolnikov. But coming to Petersburg he quarrelled with me, the day\\r\\nbefore yesterday, at our first meeting and I drove him out of my room--I\\r\\nhave two witnesses to prove it. He is a very spiteful man.... The day\\r\\nbefore yesterday I did not know that he was staying here, in your room,\\r\\nand that consequently on the very day we quarrelled--the day before\\r\\nyesterday--he saw me give Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral,\\r\\nas a friend of the late Mr. Marmeladov. He at once wrote a note to\\r\\nmy mother and informed her that I had given away all my money, not\\r\\nto Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna, and referred in a most\\r\\ncontemptible way to the... character of Sofya Semyonovna, that is,\\r\\nhinted at the character of my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna. All this you\\r\\nunderstand was with the object of dividing me from my mother and sister,\\r\\nby insinuating that I was squandering on unworthy objects the money\\r\\nwhich they had sent me and which was all they had. Yesterday evening,\\r\\nbefore my mother and sister and in his presence, I declared that I had\\r\\ngiven the money to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral and not to Sofya\\r\\nSemyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya Semyonovna and had\\r\\nnever seen her before, indeed. At the same time I added that he,\\r\\nPyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, with all his virtues, was not worth Sofya\\r\\nSemyonovna’s little finger, though he spoke so ill of her. To his\\r\\nquestion--would I let Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister, I\\r\\nanswered that I had already done so that day. Irritated that my mother\\r\\nand sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuations, he\\r\\ngradually began being unpardonably rude to them. A final rupture took\\r\\nplace and he was turned out of the house. All this happened yesterday\\r\\nevening. Now I beg your special attention: consider: if he had now\\r\\nsucceeded in proving that Sofya Semyonovna was a thief, he would\\r\\nhave shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in his\\r\\nsuspicions, that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on\\r\\na level with Sofya Semyonovna, that, in attacking me, he was protecting\\r\\nand preserving the honour of my sister, his betrothed. In fact he might\\r\\neven, through all this, have been able to estrange me from my family,\\r\\nand no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them; to say nothing\\r\\nof revenging himself on me personally, for he has grounds for supposing\\r\\nthat the honour and happiness of Sofya Semyonovna are very precious to\\r\\nme. That was what he was working for! That’s how I understand it. That’s\\r\\nthe whole reason for it and there can be no other!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was like this, or somewhat like this, that Raskolnikov wound up his\\r\\nspeech which was followed very attentively, though often interrupted by\\r\\nexclamations from his audience. But in spite of interruptions he spoke\\r\\nclearly, calmly, exactly, firmly. His decisive voice, his tone of\\r\\nconviction and his stern face made a great impression on everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes, that’s it,” Lebeziatnikov assented gleefully, “that must be\\r\\nit, for he asked me, as soon as Sofya Semyonovna came into our room,\\r\\nwhether you were here, whether I had seen you among Katerina Ivanovna’s\\r\\nguests. He called me aside to the window and asked me in secret. It was\\r\\nessential for him that you should be here! That’s it, that’s it!”\\r\\n\\r\\nLuzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak. But he was very pale. He\\r\\nseemed to be deliberating on some means of escape. Perhaps he would have\\r\\nbeen glad to give up everything and get away, but at the moment this\\r\\nwas scarcely possible. It would have implied admitting the truth of\\r\\nthe accusations brought against him. Moreover, the company, which had\\r\\nalready been excited by drink, was now too much stirred to allow it. The\\r\\ncommissariat clerk, though indeed he had not grasped the whole position,\\r\\nwas shouting louder than anyone and was making some suggestions very\\r\\nunpleasant to Luzhin. But not all those present were drunk; lodgers came\\r\\nin from all the rooms. The three Poles were tremendously excited\\r\\nand were continually shouting at him: “The _pan_ is a _lajdak_!” and\\r\\nmuttering threats in Polish. Sonia had been listening with strained\\r\\nattention, though she too seemed unable to grasp it all; she seemed as\\r\\nthough she had just returned to consciousness. She did not take her\\r\\neyes off Raskolnikov, feeling that all her safety lay in him. Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearfully exhausted.\\r\\nAmalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid than anyone, with her mouth\\r\\nwide open, unable to make out what had happened. She only saw that Pyotr\\r\\nPetrovitch had somehow come to grief.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov was attempting to speak again, but they did not let him.\\r\\nEveryone was crowding round Luzhin with threats and shouts of abuse.\\r\\nBut Pyotr Petrovitch was not intimidated. Seeing that his accusation of\\r\\nSonia had completely failed, he had recourse to insolence:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Allow me, gentlemen, allow me! Don’t squeeze, let me pass!” he said,\\r\\nmaking his way through the crowd. “And no threats, if you please! I\\r\\nassure you it will be useless, you will gain nothing by it. On the\\r\\ncontrary, you’ll have to answer, gentlemen, for violently obstructing\\r\\nthe course of justice. The thief has been more than unmasked, and I\\r\\nshall prosecute. Our judges are not so blind and... not so drunk, and\\r\\nwill not believe the testimony of two notorious infidels, agitators, and\\r\\natheists, who accuse me from motives of personal revenge which they are\\r\\nfoolish enough to admit.... Yes, allow me to pass!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t let me find a trace of you in my room! Kindly leave at once, and\\r\\neverything is at an end between us! When I think of the trouble I’ve\\r\\nbeen taking, the way I’ve been expounding... all this fortnight!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I told you myself to-day that I was going, when you tried to keep me;\\r\\nnow I will simply add that you are a fool. I advise you to see a doctor\\r\\nfor your brains and your short sight. Let me pass, gentlemen!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe forced his way through. But the commissariat clerk was unwilling to\\r\\nlet him off so easily: he picked up a glass from the table, brandished\\r\\nit in the air and flung it at Pyotr Petrovitch; but the glass flew\\r\\nstraight at Amalia Ivanovna. She screamed, and the clerk, overbalancing,\\r\\nfell heavily under the table. Pyotr Petrovitch made his way to his room\\r\\nand half an hour later had left the house. Sonia, timid by nature, had\\r\\nfelt before that day that she could be ill-treated more easily than\\r\\nanyone, and that she could be wronged with impunity. Yet till that\\r\\nmoment she had fancied that she might escape misfortune by care,\\r\\ngentleness and submissiveness before everyone. Her disappointment was\\r\\ntoo great. She could, of course, bear with patience and almost without\\r\\nmurmur anything, even this. But for the first minute she felt it too\\r\\nbitter. In spite of her triumph and her justification--when her first\\r\\nterror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it all\\r\\nclearly--the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her\\r\\nmade her heart throb with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical\\r\\nweeping. At last, unable to bear any more, she rushed out of the room\\r\\nand ran home, almost immediately after Luzhin’s departure. When amidst\\r\\nloud laughter the glass flew at Amalia Ivanovna, it was more than the\\r\\nlandlady could endure. With a shriek she rushed like a fury at Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna, considering her to blame for everything.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Out of my lodgings! At once! Quick march!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with these words she began snatching up everything she could lay\\r\\nher hands on that belonged to Katerina Ivanovna, and throwing it on the\\r\\nfloor. Katerina Ivanovna, pale, almost fainting, and gasping for breath,\\r\\njumped up from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and darted at\\r\\nAmalia Ivanovna. But the battle was too unequal: the landlady waved her\\r\\naway like a feather.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What! As though that godless calumny was not enough--this vile creature\\r\\nattacks me! What! On the day of my husband’s funeral I am turned out of\\r\\nmy lodging! After eating my bread and salt she turns me into the street,\\r\\nwith my orphans! Where am I to go?” wailed the poor woman, sobbing and\\r\\ngasping. “Good God!” she cried with flashing eyes, “is there no justice\\r\\nupon earth? Whom should you protect if not us orphans? We shall see!\\r\\nThere is law and justice on earth, there is, I will find it! Wait a bit,\\r\\ngodless creature! Polenka, stay with the children, I’ll come back. Wait\\r\\nfor me, if you have to wait in the street. We will see whether there is\\r\\njustice on earth!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd throwing over her head that green shawl which Marmeladov had\\r\\nmentioned to Raskolnikov, Katerina Ivanovna squeezed her way through the\\r\\ndisorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and,\\r\\nwailing and tearful, she ran into the street--with a vague intention\\r\\nof going at once somewhere to find justice. Polenka with the two little\\r\\nones in her arms crouched, terrified, on the trunk in the corner of the\\r\\nroom, where she waited trembling for her mother to come back. Amalia\\r\\nIvanovna raged about the room, shrieking, lamenting and throwing\\r\\neverything she came across on the floor. The lodgers talked\\r\\nincoherently, some commented to the best of their ability on what had\\r\\nhappened, others quarrelled and swore at one another, while others\\r\\nstruck up a song....\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now it’s time for me to go,” thought Raskolnikov. “Well, Sofya\\r\\nSemyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he set off in the direction of Sonia’s lodgings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion of Sonia against\\r\\nLuzhin, although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own\\r\\nheart. But having gone through so much in the morning, he found a sort\\r\\nof relief in a change of sensations, apart from the strong personal\\r\\nfeeling which impelled him to defend Sonia. He was agitated too,\\r\\nespecially at some moments, by the thought of his approaching interview\\r\\nwith Sonia: he _had_ to tell her who had killed Lizaveta. He knew the\\r\\nterrible suffering it would be to him and, as it were, brushed away the\\r\\nthought of it. So when he cried as he left Katerina Ivanovna’s, “Well,\\r\\nSofya Semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!” he was still\\r\\nsuperficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from his triumph over\\r\\nLuzhin. But, strange to say, by the time he reached Sonia’s lodging, he\\r\\nfelt a sudden impotence and fear. He stood still in hesitation at the\\r\\ndoor, asking himself the strange question: “Must he tell her who killed\\r\\nLizaveta?” It was a strange question because he felt at the very time\\r\\nnot only that he could not help telling her, but also that he could\\r\\nnot put off the telling. He did not yet know why it must be so, he\\r\\nonly _felt_ it, and the agonising sense of his impotence before\\r\\nthe inevitable almost crushed him. To cut short his hesitation and\\r\\nsuffering, he quickly opened the door and looked at Sonia from the\\r\\ndoorway. She was sitting with her elbows on the table and her face in\\r\\nher hands, but seeing Raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet\\r\\nhim as though she were expecting him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What would have become of me but for you?” she said quickly, meeting\\r\\nhim in the middle of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvidently she was in haste to say this to him. It was what she had been\\r\\nwaiting for.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she\\r\\nhad only just risen. She stood facing him, two steps away, just as she\\r\\nhad done the day before.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Sonia?” he said, and felt that his voice was trembling, “it was\\r\\nall due to ‘your social position and the habits associated with it.’ Did\\r\\nyou understand that just now?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHer face showed her distress.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only don’t talk to me as you did yesterday,” she interrupted him.\\r\\n“Please don’t begin it. There is misery enough without that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe made haste to smile, afraid that he might not like the reproach.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was silly to come away from there. What is happening there now? I\\r\\nwanted to go back directly, but I kept thinking that... you would come.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe told her that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out of their lodging\\r\\nand that Katerina Ivanovna had run off somewhere “to seek justice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My God!” cried Sonia, “let’s go at once....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she snatched up her cape.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s everlastingly the same thing!” said Raskolnikov, irritably.\\r\\n“You’ve no thought except for them! Stay a little with me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But... Katerina Ivanovna?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You won’t lose Katerina Ivanovna, you may be sure, she’ll come to you\\r\\nherself since she has run out,” he added peevishly. “If she doesn’t find\\r\\nyou here, you’ll be blamed for it....”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia sat down in painful suspense. Raskolnikov was silent, gazing at\\r\\nthe floor and deliberating.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you,” he began, not looking\\r\\nat Sonia, “but if he had wanted to, if it had suited his plans, he would\\r\\nhave sent you to prison if it had not been for Lebeziatnikov and me.\\r\\nAh?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” she assented in a faint voice. “Yes,” she repeated, preoccupied\\r\\nand distressed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I might easily not have been there. And it was quite an accident\\r\\nLebeziatnikov’s turning up.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And if you’d gone to prison, what then? Do you remember what I said\\r\\nyesterday?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain she did not answer. He waited.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought you would cry out again ‘don’t speak of it, leave off.’”\\r\\n Raskolnikov gave a laugh, but rather a forced one. “What, silence\\r\\nagain?” he asked a minute later. “We must talk about something, you\\r\\nknow. It would be interesting for me to know how you would decide a\\r\\ncertain ‘problem’ as Lebeziatnikov would say.” (He was beginning to lose\\r\\nthe thread.) “No, really, I am serious. Imagine, Sonia, that you had\\r\\nknown all Luzhin’s intentions beforehand. Known, that is, for a fact,\\r\\nthat they would be the ruin of Katerina Ivanovna and the children and\\r\\nyourself thrown in--since you don’t count yourself for anything--Polenka\\r\\ntoo... for she’ll go the same way. Well, if suddenly it all depended on\\r\\nyour decision whether he or they should go on living, that is whether\\r\\nLuzhin should go on living and doing wicked things, or Katerina Ivanovna\\r\\nshould die? How would you decide which of them was to die? I ask you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia looked uneasily at him. There was something peculiar in this\\r\\nhesitating question, which seemed approaching something in a roundabout\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I felt that you were going to ask some question like that,” she said,\\r\\nlooking inquisitively at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I dare say you did. But how is it to be answered?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why do you ask about what could not happen?” said Sonia reluctantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then it would be better for Luzhin to go on living and doing wicked\\r\\nthings? You haven’t dared to decide even that!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I can’t know the Divine Providence.... And why do you ask what\\r\\ncan’t be answered? What’s the use of such foolish questions? How could\\r\\nit happen that it should depend on my decision--who has made me a judge\\r\\nto decide who is to live and who is not to live?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, if the Divine Providence is to be mixed up in it, there is no doing\\r\\nanything,” Raskolnikov grumbled morosely.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’d better say straight out what you want!” Sonia cried in distress.\\r\\n“You are leading up to something again.... Can you have come simply to\\r\\ntorture me?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not control herself and began crying bitterly. He looked at\\r\\nher in gloomy misery. Five minutes passed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course you’re right, Sonia,” he said softly at last. He was suddenly\\r\\nchanged. His tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance was gone.\\r\\nEven his voice was suddenly weak. “I told you yesterday that I was not\\r\\ncoming to ask forgiveness and almost the first thing I’ve said is to ask\\r\\nforgiveness.... I said that about Luzhin and Providence for my own sake.\\r\\nI was asking forgiveness, Sonia....”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tried to smile, but there was something helpless and incomplete in\\r\\nhis pale smile. He bowed his head and hid his face in his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd suddenly a strange, surprising sensation of a sort of bitter hatred\\r\\nfor Sonia passed through his heart. As it were wondering and frightened\\r\\nof this sensation, he raised his head and looked intently at her; but he\\r\\nmet her uneasy and painfully anxious eyes fixed on him; there was\\r\\nlove in them; his hatred vanished like a phantom. It was not the real\\r\\nfeeling; he had taken the one feeling for the other. It only meant that\\r\\n_that_ minute had come.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head. Suddenly he\\r\\nturned pale, got up from his chair, looked at Sonia, and without\\r\\nuttering a word sat down mechanically on her bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis sensations that moment were terribly like the moment when he had\\r\\nstood over the old woman with the axe in his hand and felt that “he must\\r\\nnot lose another minute.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s the matter?” asked Sonia, dreadfully frightened.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could not utter a word. This was not at all, not at all the way he\\r\\nhad intended to “tell” and he did not understand what was happening to\\r\\nhim now. She went up to him, softly, sat down on the bed beside him and\\r\\nwaited, not taking her eyes off him. Her heart throbbed and sank. It\\r\\nwas unendurable; he turned his deadly pale face to her. His lips worked,\\r\\nhelplessly struggling to utter something. A pang of terror passed\\r\\nthrough Sonia’s heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s the matter?” she repeated, drawing a little away from him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing, Sonia, don’t be frightened.... It’s nonsense. It really is\\r\\nnonsense, if you think of it,” he muttered, like a man in delirium. “Why\\r\\nhave I come to torture you?” he added suddenly, looking at her. “Why,\\r\\nreally? I keep asking myself that question, Sonia....”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an hour\\r\\nbefore, but now he spoke helplessly, hardly knowing what he said and\\r\\nfeeling a continual tremor all over.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, how you are suffering!” she muttered in distress, looking intently\\r\\nat him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s all nonsense.... Listen, Sonia.” He suddenly smiled, a pale\\r\\nhelpless smile for two seconds. “You remember what I meant to tell you\\r\\nyesterday?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia waited uneasily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I said as I went away that perhaps I was saying good-bye for ever, but\\r\\nthat if I came to-day I would tell you who... who killed Lizaveta.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe began trembling all over.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, here I’ve come to tell you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you really meant it yesterday?” she whispered with difficulty.\\r\\n“How do you know?” she asked quickly, as though suddenly regaining her\\r\\nreason.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia’s face grew paler and paler, and she breathed painfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused a minute.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have they found him?” she asked timidly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then how do you know about _it_?” she asked again, hardly audibly and\\r\\nagain after a minute’s pause.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned to her and looked very intently at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Guess,” he said, with the same distorted helpless smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nA shudder passed over her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you... why do you frighten me like this?” she said, smiling like a\\r\\nchild.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must be a great friend of _his_... since I know,” Raskolnikov went\\r\\non, still gazing into her face, as though he could not turn his eyes\\r\\naway. “He... did not mean to kill that Lizaveta... he... killed her\\r\\naccidentally.... He meant to kill the old woman when she was alone and\\r\\nhe went there... and then Lizaveta came in... he killed her too.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother awful moment passed. Both still gazed at one another.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can’t guess, then?” he asked suddenly, feeling as though he were\\r\\nflinging himself down from a steeple.\\r\\n\\r\\n“N-no...” whispered Sonia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Take a good look.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as he had said this again, the same familiar sensation froze his\\r\\nheart. He looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the\\r\\nface of Lizaveta. He remembered clearly the expression in Lizaveta’s\\r\\nface, when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the\\r\\nwall, putting out her hand, with childish terror in her face, looking\\r\\nas little children do when they begin to be frightened of something,\\r\\nlooking intently and uneasily at what frightens them, shrinking back and\\r\\nholding out their little hands on the point of crying. Almost the same\\r\\nthing happened now to Sonia. With the same helplessness and the same\\r\\nterror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly putting out her left\\r\\nhand, pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to\\r\\nget up from the bed, moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed\\r\\neven more immovably on him. Her terror infected him. The same fear\\r\\nshowed itself on his face. In the same way he stared at her and almost\\r\\nwith the same _childish_ smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you guessed?” he whispered at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good God!” broke in an awful wail from her bosom.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillows, but a\\r\\nmoment later she got up, moved quickly to him, seized both his hands\\r\\nand, gripping them tight in her thin fingers, began looking into his\\r\\nface again with the same intent stare. In this last desperate look she\\r\\ntried to look into him and catch some last hope. But there was no hope;\\r\\nthere was no doubt remaining; it was all true! Later on, indeed, when\\r\\nshe recalled that moment, she thought it strange and wondered why she\\r\\nhad seen at once that there was no doubt. She could not have said, for\\r\\ninstance, that she had foreseen something of the sort--and yet now, as\\r\\nsoon as he told her, she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen\\r\\nthis very thing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stop, Sonia, enough! don’t torture me,” he begged her miserably.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not at all, not at all like this he had thought of telling her,\\r\\nbut this is how it happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe jumped up, seeming not to know what she was doing, and, wringing her\\r\\nhands, walked into the middle of the room; but quickly went back and sat\\r\\ndown again beside him, her shoulder almost touching his. All of a sudden\\r\\nshe started as though she had been stabbed, uttered a cry and fell on\\r\\nher knees before him, she did not know why.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What have you done--what have you done to yourself?” she said in\\r\\ndespair, and, jumping up, she flung herself on his neck, threw her arms\\r\\nround him, and held him tightly.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mournful smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a strange girl, Sonia--you kiss me and hug me when I tell you\\r\\nabout that.... You don’t think what you are doing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is no one--no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you!” she\\r\\ncried in a frenzy, not hearing what he said, and she suddenly broke into\\r\\nviolent hysterical weeping.\\r\\n\\r\\nA feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it at\\r\\nonce. He did not struggle against it. Two tears started into his eyes\\r\\nand hung on his eyelashes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you won’t leave me, Sonia?” he said, looking at her almost with\\r\\nhope.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no, never, nowhere!” cried Sonia. “I will follow you, I will follow\\r\\nyou everywhere. Oh, my God! Oh, how miserable I am!... Why, why didn’t I\\r\\nknow you before! Why didn’t you come before? Oh, dear!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here I have come.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, now! What’s to be done now?... Together, together!” she repeated\\r\\nas it were unconsciously, and she hugged him again. “I’ll follow you to\\r\\nSiberia!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost haughty smile came to\\r\\nhis lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps I don’t want to go to Siberia yet, Sonia,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia looked at him quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain after her first passionate, agonising sympathy for the unhappy man\\r\\nthe terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her. In his changed tone she\\r\\nseemed to hear the murderer speaking. She looked at him bewildered. She\\r\\nknew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been. Now all\\r\\nthese questions rushed at once into her mind. And again she could not\\r\\nbelieve it: “He, he is a murderer! Could it be true?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s the meaning of it? Where am I?” she said in complete\\r\\nbewilderment, as though still unable to recover herself. “How could you,\\r\\nyou, a man like you.... How could you bring yourself to it?... What does\\r\\nit mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, well--to plunder. Leave off, Sonia,” he answered wearily, almost\\r\\nwith vexation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia stood as though struck dumb, but suddenly she cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n“You were hungry! It was... to help your mother? Yes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, Sonia, no,” he muttered, turning away and hanging his head. “I was\\r\\nnot so hungry.... I certainly did want to help my mother, but... that’s\\r\\nnot the real thing either.... Don’t torture me, Sonia.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia clasped her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Could it, could it all be true? Good God, what a truth! Who could\\r\\nbelieve it? And how could you give away your last farthing and yet\\r\\nrob and murder! Ah,” she cried suddenly, “that money you gave Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna... that money.... Can that money...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, Sonia,” he broke in hurriedly, “that money was not it. Don’t worry\\r\\nyourself! That money my mother sent me and it came when I was ill, the\\r\\nday I gave it to you.... Razumihin saw it... he received it for me....\\r\\nThat money was mine--my own.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her utmost to comprehend.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And _that_ money.... I don’t even know really whether there was any\\r\\nmoney,” he added softly, as though reflecting. “I took a purse off her\\r\\nneck, made of chamois leather... a purse stuffed full of something...\\r\\nbut I didn’t look in it; I suppose I hadn’t time.... And the\\r\\nthings--chains and trinkets--I buried under a stone with the purse next\\r\\nmorning in a yard off the V---- Prospect. They are all there now....”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia strained every nerve to listen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then why... why, you said you did it to rob, but you took nothing?” she\\r\\nasked quickly, catching at a straw.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know.... I haven’t yet decided whether to take that money or\\r\\nnot,” he said, musing again; and, seeming to wake up with a start, he\\r\\ngave a brief ironical smile. “Ach, what silly stuff I am talking, eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought flashed through Sonia’s mind, wasn’t he mad? But she\\r\\ndismissed it at once. “No, it was something else.” She could make\\r\\nnothing of it, nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know, Sonia,” he said suddenly with conviction, “let me tell\\r\\nyou: if I’d simply killed because I was hungry,” laying stress on\\r\\nevery word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her, “I should\\r\\nbe _happy_ now. You must believe that! What would it matter to you,” he\\r\\ncried a moment later with a sort of despair, “what would it matter to\\r\\nyou if I were to confess that I did wrong? What do you gain by such\\r\\na stupid triumph over me? Ah, Sonia, was it for that I’ve come to you\\r\\nto-day?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain Sonia tried to say something, but did not speak.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all I have left.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go where?” asked Sonia timidly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not to steal and not to murder, don’t be anxious,” he smiled bitterly.\\r\\n“We are so different.... And you know, Sonia, it’s only now, only this\\r\\nmoment that I understand _where_ I asked you to go with me yesterday!\\r\\nYesterday when I said it I did not know where. I asked you for one\\r\\nthing, I came to you for one thing--not to leave me. You won’t leave me,\\r\\nSonia?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe squeezed his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And why, why did I tell her? Why did I let her know?” he cried a minute\\r\\nlater in despair, looking with infinite anguish at her. “Here you expect\\r\\nan explanation from me, Sonia; you are sitting and waiting for it, I see\\r\\nthat. But what can I tell you? You won’t understand and will only suffer\\r\\nmisery... on my account! Well, you are crying and embracing me again.\\r\\nWhy do you do it? Because I couldn’t bear my burden and have come to\\r\\nthrow it on another: you suffer too, and I shall feel better! And can\\r\\nyou love such a mean wretch?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But aren’t you suffering, too?” cried Sonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart, and again for an\\r\\ninstant softened it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that. It may explain a great\\r\\ndeal. I have come because I am bad. There are men who wouldn’t have\\r\\ncome. But I am a coward and... a mean wretch. But... never mind! That’s\\r\\nnot the point. I must speak now, but I don’t know how to begin.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused and sank into thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ach, we are so different,” he cried again, “we are not alike. And why,\\r\\nwhy did I come? I shall never forgive myself that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no, it was a good thing you came,” cried Sonia. “It’s better I\\r\\nshould know, far better!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her with anguish.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What if it were really that?” he said, as though reaching a conclusion.\\r\\n“Yes, that’s what it was! I wanted to become a Napoleon, that is why I\\r\\nkilled her.... Do you understand now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“N-no,” Sonia whispered naïvely and timidly. “Only speak, speak, I shall\\r\\nunderstand, I shall understand _in myself_!” she kept begging him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll understand? Very well, we shall see!” He paused and was for some\\r\\ntime lost in meditation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was like this: I asked myself one day this question--what if\\r\\nNapoleon, for instance, had happened to be in my place, and if he had\\r\\nnot had Toulon nor Egypt nor the passage of Mont Blanc to begin his\\r\\ncareer with, but instead of all those picturesque and monumental things,\\r\\nthere had simply been some ridiculous old hag, a pawnbroker, who had\\r\\nto be murdered too to get money from her trunk (for his career, you\\r\\nunderstand). Well, would he have brought himself to that if there had\\r\\nbeen no other means? Wouldn’t he have felt a pang at its being so far\\r\\nfrom monumental and... and sinful, too? Well, I must tell you that I\\r\\nworried myself fearfully over that ‘question’ so that I was awfully\\r\\nashamed when I guessed at last (all of a sudden, somehow) that it would\\r\\nnot have given him the least pang, that it would not even have struck\\r\\nhim that it was not monumental... that he would not have seen that there\\r\\nwas anything in it to pause over, and that, if he had had no other way,\\r\\nhe would have strangled her in a minute without thinking about it!\\r\\nWell, I too... left off thinking about it... murdered her, following\\r\\nhis example. And that’s exactly how it was! Do you think it funny? Yes,\\r\\nSonia, the funniest thing of all is that perhaps that’s just how it\\r\\nwas.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia did not think it at all funny.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You had better tell me straight out... without examples,” she begged,\\r\\nstill more timidly and scarcely audibly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned to her, looked sadly at her and took her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are right again, Sonia. Of course that’s all nonsense, it’s almost\\r\\nall talk! You see, you know of course that my mother has scarcely\\r\\nanything, my sister happened to have a good education and was condemned\\r\\nto drudge as a governess. All their hopes were centered on me. I was a\\r\\nstudent, but I couldn’t keep myself at the university and was forced\\r\\nfor a time to leave it. Even if I had lingered on like that, in ten\\r\\nor twelve years I might (with luck) hope to be some sort of teacher or\\r\\nclerk with a salary of a thousand roubles” (he repeated it as though it\\r\\nwere a lesson) “and by that time my mother would be worn out with grief\\r\\nand anxiety and I could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while my\\r\\nsister... well, my sister might well have fared worse! And it’s a hard\\r\\nthing to pass everything by all one’s life, to turn one’s back upon\\r\\neverything, to forget one’s mother and decorously accept the insults\\r\\ninflicted on one’s sister. Why should one? When one has buried them to\\r\\nburden oneself with others--wife and children--and to leave them again\\r\\nwithout a farthing? So I resolved to gain possession of the old woman’s\\r\\nmoney and to use it for my first years without worrying my mother,\\r\\nto keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving\\r\\nit--and to do this all on a broad, thorough scale, so as to build up\\r\\na completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence....\\r\\nWell... that’s all.... Well, of course in killing the old woman I did\\r\\nwrong.... Well, that’s enough.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe struggled to the end of his speech in exhaustion and let his head\\r\\nsink.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, that’s not it, that’s not it,” Sonia cried in distress. “How could\\r\\none... no, that’s not right, not right.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You see yourself that it’s not right. But I’ve spoken truly, it’s the\\r\\ntruth.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As though that could be the truth! Good God!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve only killed a louse, Sonia, a useless, loathsome, harmful\\r\\ncreature.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A human being--a louse!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I too know it wasn’t a louse,” he answered, looking strangely at\\r\\nher. “But I am talking nonsense, Sonia,” he added. “I’ve been talking\\r\\nnonsense a long time.... That’s not it, you are right there. There were\\r\\nquite, quite other causes for it! I haven’t talked to anyone for so\\r\\nlong, Sonia.... My head aches dreadfully now.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis eyes shone with feverish brilliance. He was almost delirious; an\\r\\nuneasy smile strayed on his lips. His terrible exhaustion could be seen\\r\\nthrough his excitement. Sonia saw how he was suffering. She too\\r\\nwas growing dizzy. And he talked so strangely; it seemed somehow\\r\\ncomprehensible, but yet... “But how, how! Good God!” And she wrung her\\r\\nhands in despair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, Sonia, that’s not it,” he began again suddenly, raising his head,\\r\\nas though a new and sudden train of thought had struck and as it were\\r\\nroused him--“that’s not it! Better... imagine--yes, it’s certainly\\r\\nbetter--imagine that I am vain, envious, malicious, base, vindictive\\r\\nand... well, perhaps with a tendency to insanity. (Let’s have it all out\\r\\nat once! They’ve talked of madness already, I noticed.) I told you just\\r\\nnow I could not keep myself at the university. But do you know that\\r\\nperhaps I might have done? My mother would have sent me what I needed\\r\\nfor the fees and I could have earned enough for clothes, boots and food,\\r\\nno doubt. Lessons had turned up at half a rouble. Razumihin works! But I\\r\\nturned sulky and wouldn’t. (Yes, sulkiness, that’s the right word for\\r\\nit!) I sat in my room like a spider. You’ve been in my den, you’ve seen\\r\\nit.... And do you know, Sonia, that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp\\r\\nthe soul and the mind? Ah, how I hated that garret! And yet I wouldn’t\\r\\ngo out of it! I wouldn’t on purpose! I didn’t go out for days together,\\r\\nand I wouldn’t work, I wouldn’t even eat, I just lay there doing\\r\\nnothing. If Nastasya brought me anything, I ate it, if she didn’t, I\\r\\nwent all day without; I wouldn’t ask, on purpose, from sulkiness! At\\r\\nnight I had no light, I lay in the dark and I wouldn’t earn money for\\r\\ncandles. I ought to have studied, but I sold my books; and the dust lies\\r\\nan inch thick on the notebooks on my table. I preferred lying still and\\r\\nthinking. And I kept thinking.... And I had dreams all the time, strange\\r\\ndreams of all sorts, no need to describe! Only then I began to fancy\\r\\nthat... No, that’s not it! Again I am telling you wrong! You see I kept\\r\\nasking myself then: why am I so stupid that if others are stupid--and I\\r\\nknow they are--yet I won’t be wiser? Then I saw, Sonia, that if one\\r\\nwaits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long.... Afterwards I\\r\\nunderstood that that would never come to pass, that men won’t change and\\r\\nthat nobody can alter it and that it’s not worth wasting effort over it.\\r\\nYes, that’s so. That’s the law of their nature, Sonia,... that’s so!...\\r\\nAnd I know now, Sonia, that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will\\r\\nhave power over them. Anyone who is greatly daring is right in their\\r\\neyes. He who despises most things will be a lawgiver among them and he\\r\\nwho dares most of all will be most in the right! So it has been till now\\r\\nand so it will always be. A man must be blind not to see it!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Raskolnikov looked at Sonia as he said this, he no longer cared\\r\\nwhether she understood or not. The fever had complete hold of him; he\\r\\nwas in a sort of gloomy ecstasy (he certainly had been too long without\\r\\ntalking to anyone). Sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his\\r\\nfaith and code.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I divined then, Sonia,” he went on eagerly, “that power is only\\r\\nvouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up. There is only\\r\\none thing, one thing needful: one has only to dare! Then for the first\\r\\ntime in my life an idea took shape in my mind which no one had ever\\r\\nthought of before me, no one! I saw clear as daylight how strange it is\\r\\nthat not a single person living in this mad world has had the daring to\\r\\ngo straight for it all and send it flying to the devil! I... I wanted\\r\\n_to have the daring_... and I killed her. I only wanted to have the\\r\\ndaring, Sonia! That was the whole cause of it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh hush, hush,” cried Sonia, clasping her hands. “You turned away from\\r\\nGod and God has smitten you, has given you over to the devil!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then Sonia, when I used to lie there in the dark and all this became\\r\\nclear to me, was it a temptation of the devil, eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hush, don’t laugh, blasphemer! You don’t understand, you don’t\\r\\nunderstand! Oh God! He won’t understand!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hush, Sonia! I am not laughing. I know myself that it was the devil\\r\\nleading me. Hush, Sonia, hush!” he repeated with gloomy insistence. “I\\r\\nknow it all, I have thought it all over and over and whispered it all\\r\\nover to myself, lying there in the dark.... I’ve argued it all over with\\r\\nmyself, every point of it, and I know it all, all! And how sick, how\\r\\nsick I was then of going over it all! I have kept wanting to forget it\\r\\nand make a new beginning, Sonia, and leave off thinking. And you don’t\\r\\nsuppose that I went into it headlong like a fool? I went into it like a\\r\\nwise man, and that was just my destruction. And you mustn’t suppose that\\r\\nI didn’t know, for instance, that if I began to question myself whether\\r\\nI had the right to gain power--I certainly hadn’t the right--or that if\\r\\nI asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasn’t\\r\\nso for me, though it might be for a man who would go straight to his\\r\\ngoal without asking questions.... If I worried myself all those days,\\r\\nwondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not, I felt clearly\\r\\nof course that I wasn’t Napoleon. I had to endure all the agony of that\\r\\nbattle of ideas, Sonia, and I longed to throw it off: I wanted to murder\\r\\nwithout casuistry, to murder for my own sake, for myself alone! I didn’t\\r\\nwant to lie about it even to myself. It wasn’t to help my mother I did\\r\\nthe murder--that’s nonsense--I didn’t do the murder to gain wealth and\\r\\npower and to become a benefactor of mankind. Nonsense! I simply did it;\\r\\nI did the murder for myself, for myself alone, and whether I became a\\r\\nbenefactor to others, or spent my life like a spider catching men in\\r\\nmy web and sucking the life out of men, I couldn’t have cared at that\\r\\nmoment.... And it was not the money I wanted, Sonia, when I did it. It\\r\\nwas not so much the money I wanted, but something else.... I know it all\\r\\nnow.... Understand me! Perhaps I should never have committed a murder\\r\\nagain. I wanted to find out something else; it was something else led\\r\\nme on. I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse\\r\\nlike everybody else or a man. Whether I can step over barriers or\\r\\nnot, whether I dare stoop to pick up or not, whether I am a trembling\\r\\ncreature or whether I have the _right_...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To kill? Have the right to kill?” Sonia clasped her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ach, Sonia!” he cried irritably and seemed about to make some retort,\\r\\nbut was contemptuously silent. “Don’t interrupt me, Sonia. I want to\\r\\nprove one thing only, that the devil led me on then and he has shown me\\r\\nsince that I had not the right to take that path, because I am just such\\r\\na louse as all the rest. He was mocking me and here I’ve come to you\\r\\nnow! Welcome your guest! If I were not a louse, should I have come to\\r\\nyou? Listen: when I went then to the old woman’s I only went to\\r\\n_try_.... You may be sure of that!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you murdered her!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But how did I murder her? Is that how men do murders? Do men go to\\r\\ncommit a murder as I went then? I will tell you some day how I went!\\r\\nDid I murder the old woman? I murdered myself, not her! I crushed myself\\r\\nonce for all, for ever.... But it was the devil that killed that old\\r\\nwoman, not I. Enough, enough, Sonia, enough! Let me be!” he cried in a\\r\\nsudden spasm of agony, “let me be!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe leaned his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head in his hands as\\r\\nin a vise.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What suffering!” A wail of anguish broke from Sonia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, what am I to do now?” he asked, suddenly raising his head and\\r\\nlooking at her with a face hideously distorted by despair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you to do?” she cried, jumping up, and her eyes that had been\\r\\nfull of tears suddenly began to shine. “Stand up!” (She seized him by\\r\\nthe shoulder, he got up, looking at her almost bewildered.) “Go at once,\\r\\nthis very minute, stand at the cross-roads, bow down, first kiss the\\r\\nearth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say\\r\\nto all men aloud, ‘I am a murderer!’ Then God will send you life again.\\r\\nWill you go, will you go?” she asked him, trembling all over, snatching\\r\\nhis two hands, squeezing them tight in hers and gazing at him with eyes\\r\\nfull of fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was amazed at her sudden ecstasy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You mean Siberia, Sonia? I must give myself up?” he asked gloomily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Suffer and expiate your sin by it, that’s what you must do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No! I am not going to them, Sonia!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But how will you go on living? What will you live for?” cried Sonia,\\r\\n“how is it possible now? Why, how can you talk to your mother? (Oh, what\\r\\nwill become of them now?) But what am I saying? You have abandoned your\\r\\nmother and your sister already. He has abandoned them already! Oh,\\r\\nGod!” she cried, “why, he knows it all himself. How, how can he live by\\r\\nhimself! What will become of you now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t be a child, Sonia,” he said softly. “What wrong have I done\\r\\nthem? Why should I go to them? What should I say to them? That’s only a\\r\\nphantom.... They destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as a\\r\\nvirtue. They are knaves and scoundrels, Sonia! I am not going to them.\\r\\nAnd what should I say to them--that I murdered her, but did not dare to\\r\\ntake the money and hid it under a stone?” he added with a bitter smile.\\r\\n“Why, they would laugh at me, and would call me a fool for not getting\\r\\nit. A coward and a fool! They wouldn’t understand and they don’t deserve\\r\\nto understand. Why should I go to them? I won’t. Don’t be a child,\\r\\nSonia....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It will be too much for you to bear, too much!” she repeated, holding\\r\\nout her hands in despairing supplication.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps I’ve been unfair to myself,” he observed gloomily, pondering,\\r\\n“perhaps after all I am a man and not a louse and I’ve been in too great\\r\\na hurry to condemn myself. I’ll make another fight for it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA haughty smile appeared on his lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a burden to bear! And your whole life, your whole life!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall get used to it,” he said grimly and thoughtfully. “Listen,” he\\r\\nbegan a minute later, “stop crying, it’s time to talk of the facts: I’ve\\r\\ncome to tell you that the police are after me, on my track....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ach!” Sonia cried in terror.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, why do you cry out? You want me to go to Siberia and now you are\\r\\nfrightened? But let me tell you: I shall not give myself up. I shall\\r\\nmake a struggle for it and they won’t do anything to me. They’ve no real\\r\\nevidence. Yesterday I was in great danger and believed I was lost; but\\r\\nto-day things are going better. All the facts they know can be explained\\r\\ntwo ways, that’s to say I can turn their accusations to my credit, do\\r\\nyou understand? And I shall, for I’ve learnt my lesson. But they will\\r\\ncertainly arrest me. If it had not been for something that happened,\\r\\nthey would have done so to-day for certain; perhaps even now they will\\r\\narrest me to-day.... But that’s no matter, Sonia; they’ll let me out\\r\\nagain... for there isn’t any real proof against me, and there won’t be,\\r\\nI give you my word for it. And they can’t convict a man on what they\\r\\nhave against me. Enough.... I only tell you that you may know.... I will\\r\\ntry to manage somehow to put it to my mother and sister so that they\\r\\nwon’t be frightened.... My sister’s future is secure, however, now, I\\r\\nbelieve... and my mother’s must be too.... Well, that’s all. Be careful,\\r\\nthough. Will you come and see me in prison when I am there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I will, I will.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sat side by side, both mournful and dejected, as though they had\\r\\nbeen cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore. He looked at\\r\\nSonia and felt how great was her love for him, and strange to say he\\r\\nfelt it suddenly burdensome and painful to be so loved. Yes, it was a\\r\\nstrange and awful sensation! On his way to see Sonia he had felt that\\r\\nall his hopes rested on her; he expected to be rid of at least part\\r\\nof his suffering, and now, when all her heart turned towards him, he\\r\\nsuddenly felt that he was immeasurably unhappier than before.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sonia,” he said, “you’d better not come and see me when I am in\\r\\nprison.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia did not answer, she was crying. Several minutes passed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you a cross on you?” she asked, as though suddenly thinking of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not at first understand the question.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, of course not. Here, take this one, of cypress wood. I have\\r\\nanother, a copper one that belonged to Lizaveta. I changed with\\r\\nLizaveta: she gave me her cross and I gave her my little ikon. I will\\r\\nwear Lizaveta’s now and give you this. Take it... it’s mine! It’s mine,\\r\\nyou know,” she begged him. “We will go to suffer together, and together\\r\\nwe will bear our cross!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give it me,” said Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not want to hurt her feelings. But immediately he drew back the\\r\\nhand he held out for the cross.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not now, Sonia. Better later,” he added to comfort her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes, better,” she repeated with conviction, “when you go to meet\\r\\nyour suffering, then put it on. You will come to me, I’ll put it on you,\\r\\nwe will pray and go together.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment someone knocked three times at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sofya Semyonovna, may I come in?” they heard in a very familiar and\\r\\npolite voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia rushed to the door in a fright. The flaxen head of Mr.\\r\\nLebeziatnikov appeared at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\nLebeziatnikov looked perturbed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve come to you, Sofya Semyonovna,” he began. “Excuse me... I thought\\r\\nI should find you,” he said, addressing Raskolnikov suddenly, “that is,\\r\\nI didn’t mean anything... of that sort... But I just thought... Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna has gone out of her mind,” he blurted out suddenly, turning\\r\\nfrom Raskolnikov to Sonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia screamed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At least it seems so. But... we don’t know what to do, you see! She\\r\\ncame back--she seems to have been turned out somewhere, perhaps\\r\\nbeaten.... So it seems at least,... She had run to your father’s former\\r\\nchief, she didn’t find him at home: he was dining at some other\\r\\ngeneral’s.... Only fancy, she rushed off there, to the other general’s,\\r\\nand, imagine, she was so persistent that she managed to get the chief to\\r\\nsee her, had him fetched out from dinner, it seems. You can imagine what\\r\\nhappened. She was turned out, of course; but, according to her own\\r\\nstory, she abused him and threw something at him. One may well believe\\r\\nit.... How it is she wasn’t taken up, I can’t understand! Now she is\\r\\ntelling everyone, including Amalia Ivanovna; but it’s difficult to\\r\\nunderstand her, she is screaming and flinging herself about.... Oh yes,\\r\\nshe shouts that since everyone has abandoned her, she will take the\\r\\nchildren and go into the street with a barrel-organ, and the children\\r\\nwill sing and dance, and she too, and collect money, and will go every\\r\\nday under the general’s window... ‘to let everyone see well-born\\r\\nchildren, whose father was an official, begging in the street.’ She\\r\\nkeeps beating the children and they are all crying. She is teaching Lida\\r\\nto sing ‘My Village,’ the boy to dance, Polenka the same. She is tearing\\r\\nup all the clothes, and making them little caps like actors; she means\\r\\nto carry a tin basin and make it tinkle, instead of music.... She won’t\\r\\nlisten to anything.... Imagine the state of things! It’s beyond\\r\\nanything!”\\r\\n\\r\\nLebeziatnikov would have gone on, but Sonia, who had heard him almost\\r\\nbreathless, snatched up her cloak and hat, and ran out of the room,\\r\\nputting on her things as she went. Raskolnikov followed her and\\r\\nLebeziatnikov came after him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She has certainly gone mad!” he said to Raskolnikov, as they went out\\r\\ninto the street. “I didn’t want to frighten Sofya Semyonovna, so I said\\r\\n‘it seemed like it,’ but there isn’t a doubt of it. They say that in\\r\\nconsumption the tubercles sometimes occur in the brain; it’s a pity I\\r\\nknow nothing of medicine. I did try to persuade her, but she wouldn’t\\r\\nlisten.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you talk to her about the tubercles?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not precisely of the tubercles. Besides, she wouldn’t have understood!\\r\\nBut what I say is, that if you convince a person logically that he\\r\\nhas nothing to cry about, he’ll stop crying. That’s clear. Is it your\\r\\nconviction that he won’t?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Life would be too easy if it were so,” answered Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me, excuse me; of course it would be rather difficult for\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna to understand, but do you know that in Paris they have\\r\\nbeen conducting serious experiments as to the possibility of curing the\\r\\ninsane, simply by logical argument? One professor there, a scientific\\r\\nman of standing, lately dead, believed in the possibility of such\\r\\ntreatment. His idea was that there’s nothing really wrong with the\\r\\nphysical organism of the insane, and that insanity is, so to say, a\\r\\nlogical mistake, an error of judgment, an incorrect view of things. He\\r\\ngradually showed the madman his error and, would you believe it, they\\r\\nsay he was successful? But as he made use of douches too, how far\\r\\nsuccess was due to that treatment remains uncertain.... So it seems at\\r\\nleast.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov had long ceased to listen. Reaching the house where he\\r\\nlived, he nodded to Lebeziatnikov and went in at the gate. Lebeziatnikov\\r\\nwoke up with a start, looked about him and hurried on.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov went into his little room and stood still in the middle\\r\\nof it. Why had he come back here? He looked at the yellow and tattered\\r\\npaper, at the dust, at his sofa.... From the yard came a loud continuous\\r\\nknocking; someone seemed to be hammering... He went to the window, rose\\r\\non tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air of\\r\\nabsorbed attention. But the yard was empty and he could not see who was\\r\\nhammering. In the house on the left he saw some open windows; on the\\r\\nwindow-sills were pots of sickly-looking geraniums. Linen was hung out\\r\\nof the windows... He knew it all by heart. He turned away and sat down\\r\\non the sofa.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever, never had he felt himself so fearfully alone!\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, he felt once more that he would perhaps come to hate Sonia, now\\r\\nthat he had made her more miserable.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why had he gone to her to beg for her tears? What need had he to poison\\r\\nher life? Oh, the meanness of it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will remain alone,” he said resolutely, “and she shall not come to\\r\\nthe prison!”\\r\\n\\r\\nFive minutes later he raised his head with a strange smile. That was a\\r\\nstrange thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps it really would be better in Siberia,” he thought suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could not have said how long he sat there with vague thoughts surging\\r\\nthrough his mind. All at once the door opened and Dounia came in. At\\r\\nfirst she stood still and looked at him from the doorway, just as he\\r\\nhad done at Sonia; then she came in and sat down in the same place\\r\\nas yesterday, on the chair facing him. He looked silently and almost\\r\\nvacantly at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t be angry, brother; I’ve only come for one minute,” said Dounia.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer face looked thoughtful but not stern. Her eyes were bright and soft.\\r\\nHe saw that she too had come to him with love.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Brother, now I know all, _all_. Dmitri Prokofitch has explained and\\r\\ntold me everything. They are worrying and persecuting you through a\\r\\nstupid and contemptible suspicion.... Dmitri Prokofitch told me that\\r\\nthere is no danger, and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such\\r\\nhorror. I don’t think so, and I fully understand how indignant you must\\r\\nbe, and that that indignation may have a permanent effect on you. That’s\\r\\nwhat I am afraid of. As for your cutting yourself off from us, I don’t\\r\\njudge you, I don’t venture to judge you, and forgive me for having\\r\\nblamed you for it. I feel that I too, if I had so great a trouble,\\r\\nshould keep away from everyone. I shall tell mother nothing _of this_,\\r\\nbut I shall talk about you continually and shall tell her from you that\\r\\nyou will come very soon. Don’t worry about her; _I_ will set her mind at\\r\\nrest; but don’t you try her too much--come once at least; remember that\\r\\nshe is your mother. And now I have come simply to say” (Dounia began\\r\\nto get up) “that if you should need me or should need... all my life or\\r\\nanything... call me, and I’ll come. Good-bye!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned abruptly and went towards the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dounia!” Raskolnikov stopped her and went towards her. “That Razumihin,\\r\\nDmitri Prokofitch, is a very good fellow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDounia flushed slightly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well?” she asked, waiting a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is competent, hardworking, honest and capable of real love....\\r\\nGood-bye, Dounia.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDounia flushed crimson, then suddenly she took alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what does it mean, brother? Are we really parting for ever that\\r\\nyou... give me such a parting message?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never mind.... Good-bye.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned away, and walked to the window. She stood a moment, looked at\\r\\nhim uneasily, and went out troubled.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, he was not cold to her. There was an instant (the very last one)\\r\\nwhen he had longed to take her in his arms and _say good-bye_ to her,\\r\\nand even _to tell_ her, but he had not dared even to touch her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Afterwards she may shudder when she remembers that I embraced her, and\\r\\nwill feel that I stole her kiss.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And would _she_ stand that test?” he went on a few minutes later to\\r\\nhimself. “No, she wouldn’t; girls like that can’t stand things! They\\r\\nnever do.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he thought of Sonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a breath of fresh air from the window. The daylight was\\r\\nfading. He took up his cap and went out.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could not, of course, and would not consider how ill he was. But all\\r\\nthis continual anxiety and agony of mind could not but affect him. And\\r\\nif he were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because this\\r\\ncontinual inner strain helped to keep him on his legs and in possession\\r\\nof his faculties. But this artificial excitement could not last long.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wandered aimlessly. The sun was setting. A special form of misery had\\r\\nbegun to oppress him of late. There was nothing poignant, nothing acute\\r\\nabout it; but there was a feeling of permanence, of eternity about it;\\r\\nit brought a foretaste of hopeless years of this cold leaden misery, a\\r\\nforetaste of an eternity “on a square yard of space.” Towards evening\\r\\nthis sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“With this idiotic, purely physical weakness, depending on the sunset or\\r\\nsomething, one can’t help doing something stupid! You’ll go to Dounia,\\r\\nas well as to Sonia,” he muttered bitterly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe heard his name called. He looked round. Lebeziatnikov rushed up to\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only fancy, I’ve been to your room looking for you. Only fancy, she’s\\r\\ncarried out her plan, and taken away the children. Sofya Semyonovna and\\r\\nI have had a job to find them. She is rapping on a frying-pan and making\\r\\nthe children dance. The children are crying. They keep stopping at the\\r\\ncross-roads and in front of shops; there’s a crowd of fools running\\r\\nafter them. Come along!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And Sonia?” Raskolnikov asked anxiously, hurrying after Lebeziatnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Simply frantic. That is, it’s not Sofya Semyonovna’s frantic, but\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna, though Sofya Semyonova’s frantic too. But Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna is absolutely frantic. I tell you she is quite mad. They’ll be\\r\\ntaken to the police. You can fancy what an effect that will have....\\r\\nThey are on the canal bank, near the bridge now, not far from Sofya\\r\\nSemyonovna’s, quite close.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses away from the one\\r\\nwhere Sonia lodged, there was a crowd of people, consisting principally\\r\\nof gutter children. The hoarse broken voice of Katerina Ivanovna could\\r\\nbe heard from the bridge, and it certainly was a strange spectacle\\r\\nlikely to attract a street crowd. Katerina Ivanovna in her old dress\\r\\nwith the green shawl, wearing a torn straw hat, crushed in a hideous way\\r\\non one side, was really frantic. She was exhausted and breathless. Her\\r\\nwasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever, and indeed out\\r\\nof doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home.\\r\\nBut her excitement did not flag, and every moment her irritation grew\\r\\nmore intense. She rushed at the children, shouted at them, coaxed\\r\\nthem, told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing, began\\r\\nexplaining to them why it was necessary, and driven to desperation by\\r\\ntheir not understanding, beat them.... Then she would make a rush at the\\r\\ncrowd; if she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look, she\\r\\nimmediately appealed to him to see what these children “from a genteel,\\r\\none may say aristocratic, house” had been brought to. If she heard\\r\\nlaughter or jeering in the crowd, she would rush at once at the scoffers\\r\\nand begin squabbling with them. Some people laughed, others shook their\\r\\nheads, but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman with the\\r\\nfrightened children. The frying-pan of which Lebeziatnikov had spoken\\r\\nwas not there, at least Raskolnikov did not see it. But instead of\\r\\nrapping on the pan, Katerina Ivanovna began clapping her wasted hands,\\r\\nwhen she made Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing. She too joined in\\r\\nthe singing, but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough,\\r\\nwhich made her curse in despair and even shed tears. What made her most\\r\\nfurious was the weeping and terror of Kolya and Lida. Some effort had\\r\\nbeen made to dress the children up as street singers are dressed. The\\r\\nboy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a Turk.\\r\\nThere had been no costume for Lida; she simply had a red knitted cap,\\r\\nor rather a night cap that had belonged to Marmeladov, decorated with\\r\\na broken piece of white ostrich feather, which had been Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna’s grandmother’s and had been preserved as a family possession.\\r\\nPolenka was in her everyday dress; she looked in timid perplexity at her\\r\\nmother, and kept at her side, hiding her tears. She dimly realised her\\r\\nmother’s condition, and looked uneasily about her. She was terribly\\r\\nfrightened of the street and the crowd. Sonia followed Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna, weeping and beseeching her to return home, but Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna was not to be persuaded.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Leave off, Sonia, leave off,” she shouted, speaking fast, panting and\\r\\ncoughing. “You don’t know what you ask; you are like a child! I’ve\\r\\ntold you before that I am not coming back to that drunken German. Let\\r\\neveryone, let all Petersburg see the children begging in the streets,\\r\\nthough their father was an honourable man who served all his life in\\r\\ntruth and fidelity, and one may say died in the service.” (Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna had by now invented this fantastic story and thoroughly\\r\\nbelieved it.) “Let that wretch of a general see it! And you are silly,\\r\\nSonia: what have we to eat? Tell me that. We have worried you enough, I\\r\\nwon’t go on so! Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, is that you?” she cried, seeing\\r\\nRaskolnikov and rushing up to him. “Explain to this silly girl, please,\\r\\nthat nothing better could be done! Even organ-grinders earn their\\r\\nliving, and everyone will see at once that we are different, that we are\\r\\nan honourable and bereaved family reduced to beggary. And that general\\r\\nwill lose his post, you’ll see! We shall perform under his windows every\\r\\nday, and if the Tsar drives by, I’ll fall on my knees, put the children\\r\\nbefore me, show them to him, and say ‘Defend us father.’ He is the\\r\\nfather of the fatherless, he is merciful, he’ll protect us, you’ll\\r\\nsee, and that wretch of a general.... Lida, _tenez vous droite_! Kolya,\\r\\nyou’ll dance again. Why are you whimpering? Whimpering again! What\\r\\nare you afraid of, stupid? Goodness, what am I to do with them, Rodion\\r\\nRomanovitch? If you only knew how stupid they are! What’s one to do with\\r\\nsuch children?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she, almost crying herself--which did not stop her uninterrupted,\\r\\nrapid flow of talk--pointed to the crying children. Raskolnikov tried\\r\\nto persuade her to go home, and even said, hoping to work on her vanity,\\r\\nthat it was unseemly for her to be wandering about the streets like\\r\\nan organ-grinder, as she was intending to become the principal of a\\r\\nboarding-school.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A boarding-school, ha-ha-ha! A castle in the air,” cried Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna, her laugh ending in a cough. “No, Rodion Romanovitch, that\\r\\ndream is over! All have forsaken us!... And that general.... You know,\\r\\nRodion Romanovitch, I threw an inkpot at him--it happened to be standing\\r\\nin the waiting-room by the paper where you sign your name. I wrote my\\r\\nname, threw it at him and ran away. Oh, the scoundrels, the scoundrels!\\r\\nBut enough of them, now I’ll provide for the children myself, I won’t\\r\\nbow down to anybody! She has had to bear enough for us!” she pointed\\r\\nto Sonia. “Polenka, how much have you got? Show me! What, only two\\r\\nfarthings! Oh, the mean wretches! They give us nothing, only run after\\r\\nus, putting their tongues out. There, what is that blockhead laughing\\r\\nat?” (She pointed to a man in the crowd.) “It’s all because Kolya here\\r\\nis so stupid; I have such a bother with him. What do you want, Polenka?\\r\\nTell me in French, _parlez-moi français_. Why, I’ve taught you, you know\\r\\nsome phrases. Else how are you to show that you are of good family, well\\r\\nbrought-up children, and not at all like other organ-grinders? We aren’t\\r\\ngoing to have a Punch and Judy show in the street, but to sing a genteel\\r\\nsong.... Ah, yes,... What are we to sing? You keep putting me out,\\r\\nbut we... you see, we are standing here, Rodion Romanovitch, to find\\r\\nsomething to sing and get money, something Kolya can dance to.... For,\\r\\nas you can fancy, our performance is all impromptu.... We must talk it\\r\\nover and rehearse it all thoroughly, and then we shall go to Nevsky,\\r\\nwhere there are far more people of good society, and we shall be noticed\\r\\nat once. Lida knows ‘My Village’ only, nothing but ‘My Village,’ and\\r\\neveryone sings that. We must sing something far more genteel.... Well,\\r\\nhave you thought of anything, Polenka? If only you’d help your mother!\\r\\nMy memory’s quite gone, or I should have thought of something. We really\\r\\ncan’t sing ‘An Hussar.’ Ah, let us sing in French, ‘Cinq sous,’ I have\\r\\ntaught it you, I have taught it you. And as it is in French, people will\\r\\nsee at once that you are children of good family, and that will be much\\r\\nmore touching.... You might sing ‘Marlborough s’en va-t-en guerre,’\\r\\nfor that’s quite a child’s song and is sung as a lullaby in all the\\r\\naristocratic houses.\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Marlborough s’en va-t-en guerre Ne sait quand reviendra_...”\\r\\n she began singing. “But no, better sing ‘Cinq sous.’ Now, Kolya, your\\r\\nhands on your hips, make haste, and you, Lida, keep turning the other\\r\\nway, and Polenka and I will sing and clap our hands!\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Cinq sous, cinq sous Pour monter notre menage_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n(Cough-cough-cough!) “Set your dress straight, Polenka, it’s slipped\\r\\ndown on your shoulders,” she observed, panting from coughing. “Now it’s\\r\\nparticularly necessary to behave nicely and genteelly, that all may\\r\\nsee that you are well-born children. I said at the time that the bodice\\r\\nshould be cut longer, and made of two widths. It was your fault, Sonia,\\r\\nwith your advice to make it shorter, and now you see the child is quite\\r\\ndeformed by it.... Why, you’re all crying again! What’s the matter,\\r\\nstupids? Come, Kolya, begin. Make haste, make haste! Oh, what an\\r\\nunbearable child!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Cinq sous, cinq sous.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A policeman again! What do you want?”\\r\\n\\r\\nA policeman was indeed forcing his way through the crowd. But at that\\r\\nmoment a gentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat--a solid-looking\\r\\nofficial of about fifty with a decoration on his neck (which delighted\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna and had its effect on the policeman)--approached and\\r\\nwithout a word handed her a green three-rouble note. His face wore\\r\\na look of genuine sympathy. Katerina Ivanovna took it and gave him a\\r\\npolite, even ceremonious, bow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thank you, honoured sir,” she began loftily. “The causes that have\\r\\ninduced us (take the money, Polenka: you see there are generous and\\r\\nhonourable people who are ready to help a poor gentlewoman in distress).\\r\\nYou see, honoured sir, these orphans of good family--I might even say of\\r\\naristocratic connections--and that wretch of a general sat eating\\r\\ngrouse... and stamped at my disturbing him. ‘Your excellency,’ I said,\\r\\n‘protect the orphans, for you knew my late husband, Semyon Zaharovitch,\\r\\nand on the very day of his death the basest of scoundrels slandered his\\r\\nonly daughter.’... That policeman again! Protect me,” she cried to the\\r\\nofficial. “Why is that policeman edging up to me? We have only just run\\r\\naway from one of them. What do you want, fool?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s forbidden in the streets. You mustn’t make a disturbance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s you’re making a disturbance. It’s just the same as if I were\\r\\ngrinding an organ. What business is it of yours?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have to get a licence for an organ, and you haven’t got one, and in\\r\\nthat way you collect a crowd. Where do you lodge?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What, a license?” wailed Katerina Ivanovna. “I buried my husband\\r\\nto-day. What need of a license?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Calm yourself, madam, calm yourself,” began the official. “Come along;\\r\\nI will escort you.... This is no place for you in the crowd. You are\\r\\nill.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Honoured sir, honoured sir, you don’t know,” screamed Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna. “We are going to the Nevsky.... Sonia, Sonia! Where is she?\\r\\nShe is crying too! What’s the matter with you all? Kolya, Lida, where\\r\\nare you going?” she cried suddenly in alarm. “Oh, silly children! Kolya,\\r\\nLida, where are they off to?...”\\r\\n\\r\\nKolya and Lida, scared out of their wits by the crowd, and their\\r\\nmother’s mad pranks, suddenly seized each other by the hand, and ran off\\r\\nat the sight of the policeman who wanted to take them away somewhere.\\r\\nWeeping and wailing, poor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them. She was\\r\\na piteous and unseemly spectacle, as she ran, weeping and panting for\\r\\nbreath. Sonia and Polenka rushed after them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Bring them back, bring them back, Sonia! Oh stupid, ungrateful\\r\\nchildren!... Polenka! catch them.... It’s for your sakes I...”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stumbled as she ran and fell down.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She’s cut herself, she’s bleeding! Oh, dear!” cried Sonia, bending over\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll ran up and crowded around. Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov were the\\r\\nfirst at her side, the official too hastened up, and behind him the\\r\\npoliceman who muttered, “Bother!” with a gesture of impatience, feeling\\r\\nthat the job was going to be a troublesome one.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pass on! Pass on!” he said to the crowd that pressed forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She’s dying,” someone shouted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She’s gone out of her mind,” said another.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lord have mercy upon us,” said a woman, crossing herself. “Have they\\r\\ncaught the little girl and the boy? They’re being brought back, the\\r\\nelder one’s got them.... Ah, the naughty imps!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully, they saw that she had\\r\\nnot cut herself against a stone, as Sonia thought, but that the blood\\r\\nthat stained the pavement red was from her chest.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve seen that before,” muttered the official to Raskolnikov and\\r\\nLebeziatnikov; “that’s consumption; the blood flows and chokes the\\r\\npatient. I saw the same thing with a relative of my own not long ago...\\r\\nnearly a pint of blood, all in a minute.... What’s to be done though?\\r\\nShe is dying.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This way, this way, to my room!” Sonia implored. “I live here!... See,\\r\\nthat house, the second from here.... Come to me, make haste,” she turned\\r\\nfrom one to the other. “Send for the doctor! Oh, dear!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks to the official’s efforts, this plan was adopted, the policeman\\r\\neven helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna. She was carried to Sonia’s\\r\\nroom, almost unconscious, and laid on the bed. The blood was still\\r\\nflowing, but she seemed to be coming to herself. Raskolnikov,\\r\\nLebeziatnikov, and the official accompanied Sonia into the room and were\\r\\nfollowed by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which followed\\r\\nto the very door. Polenka came in holding Kolya and Lida, who\\r\\nwere trembling and weeping. Several persons came in too from the\\r\\nKapernaumovs’ room; the landlord, a lame one-eyed man of strange\\r\\nappearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush, his\\r\\nwife, a woman with an everlastingly scared expression, and several\\r\\nopen-mouthed children with wonder-struck faces. Among these,\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov suddenly made his appearance. Raskolnikov looked at him\\r\\nwith surprise, not understanding where he had come from and not having\\r\\nnoticed him in the crowd. A doctor and priest wore spoken of. The\\r\\nofficial whispered to Raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now\\r\\nfor the doctor, but he ordered him to be sent for. Kapernaumov ran\\r\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath. The bleeding ceased\\r\\nfor a time. She looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes at\\r\\nSonia, who stood pale and trembling, wiping the sweat from her brow with\\r\\na handkerchief. At last she asked to be raised. They sat her up on the\\r\\nbed, supporting her on both sides.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where are the children?” she said in a faint voice. “You’ve brought\\r\\nthem, Polenka? Oh the sillies! Why did you run away.... Och!”\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more her parched lips were covered with blood. She moved her eyes,\\r\\nlooking about her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So that’s how you live, Sonia! Never once have I been in your room.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at her with a face of suffering.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have been your ruin, Sonia. Polenka, Lida, Kolya, come here! Well,\\r\\nhere they are, Sonia, take them all! I hand them over to you, I’ve had\\r\\nenough! The ball is over.” (Cough!) “Lay me down, let me die in peace.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey laid her back on the pillow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What, the priest? I don’t want him. You haven’t got a rouble to spare.\\r\\nI have no sins. God must forgive me without that. He knows how I have\\r\\nsuffered.... And if He won’t forgive me, I don’t care!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sank more and more into uneasy delirium. At times she shuddered,\\r\\nturned her eyes from side to side, recognised everyone for a minute,\\r\\nbut at once sank into delirium again. Her breathing was hoarse and\\r\\ndifficult, there was a sort of rattle in her throat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I said to him, your excellency,” she ejaculated, gasping after each\\r\\nword. “That Amalia Ludwigovna, ah! Lida, Kolya, hands on your hips,\\r\\nmake haste! _Glissez, glissez! pas de basque!_ Tap with your heels, be a\\r\\ngraceful child!\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Du hast Diamanten und Perlen_\\r\\n\\r\\n“What next? That’s the thing to sing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Du hast die schönsten Augen Mädchen, was willst du mehr?_\\r\\n\\r\\n“What an idea! _Was willst du mehr?_ What things the fool invents! Ah,\\r\\nyes!\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the heat of midday in the vale of Dagestan.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, how I loved it! I loved that song to distraction, Polenka! Your\\r\\nfather, you know, used to sing it when we were engaged.... Oh those\\r\\ndays! Oh that’s the thing for us to sing! How does it go? I’ve\\r\\nforgotten. Remind me! How was it?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was violently excited and tried to sit up. At last, in a horribly\\r\\nhoarse, broken voice, she began, shrieking and gasping at every word,\\r\\nwith a look of growing terror.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the heat of midday!... in the vale!... of Dagestan!... With lead in\\r\\nmy breast!...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your excellency!” she wailed suddenly with a heart-rending scream and\\r\\na flood of tears, “protect the orphans! You have been their father’s\\r\\nguest... one may say aristocratic....” She started, regaining\\r\\nconsciousness, and gazed at all with a sort of terror, but at once\\r\\nrecognised Sonia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sonia, Sonia!” she articulated softly and caressingly, as though\\r\\nsurprised to find her there. “Sonia darling, are you here, too?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey lifted her up again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Enough! It’s over! Farewell, poor thing! I am done for! I am broken!”\\r\\n she cried with vindictive despair, and her head fell heavily back on the\\r\\npillow.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sank into unconsciousness again, but this time it did not last long.\\r\\nHer pale, yellow, wasted face dropped back, her mouth fell open, her leg\\r\\nmoved convulsively, she gave a deep, deep sigh and died.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia fell upon her, flung her arms about her, and remained motionless\\r\\nwith her head pressed to the dead woman’s wasted bosom. Polenka threw\\r\\nherself at her mother’s feet, kissing them and weeping violently. Though\\r\\nKolya and Lida did not understand what had happened, they had a feeling\\r\\nthat it was something terrible; they put their hands on each other’s\\r\\nlittle shoulders, stared straight at one another and both at once opened\\r\\ntheir mouths and began screaming. They were both still in their fancy\\r\\ndress; one in a turban, the other in the cap with the ostrich feather.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd how did “the certificate of merit” come to be on the bed beside\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna? It lay there by the pillow; Raskolnikov saw it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked away to the window. Lebeziatnikov skipped up to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She is dead,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rodion Romanovitch, I must have two words with you,” said Svidrigaïlov,\\r\\ncoming up to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nLebeziatnikov at once made room for him and delicately withdrew.\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov drew Raskolnikov further away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will undertake all the arrangements, the funeral and that. You know\\r\\nit’s a question of money and, as I told you, I have plenty to spare. I\\r\\nwill put those two little ones and Polenka into some good orphan asylum,\\r\\nand I will settle fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on coming\\r\\nof age, so that Sofya Semyonovna need have no anxiety about them. And I\\r\\nwill pull her out of the mud too, for she is a good girl, isn’t she? So\\r\\ntell Avdotya Romanovna that that is how I am spending her ten thousand.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is your motive for such benevolence?” asked Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah! you sceptical person!” laughed Svidrigaïlov. “I told you I had no\\r\\nneed of that money. Won’t you admit that it’s simply done from humanity?\\r\\nShe wasn’t ‘a louse,’ you know” (he pointed to the corner where the\\r\\ndead woman lay), “was she, like some old pawnbroker woman? Come, you’ll\\r\\nagree, is Luzhin to go on living, and doing wicked things or is she to\\r\\ndie? And if I didn’t help them, Polenka would go the same way.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness, keeping his\\r\\neyes fixed on Raskolnikov, who turned white and cold, hearing his own\\r\\nphrases, spoken to Sonia. He quickly stepped back and looked wildly at\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you know?” he whispered, hardly able to breathe.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, I lodge here at Madame Resslich’s, the other side of the wall.\\r\\nHere is Kapernaumov, and there lives Madame Resslich, an old and devoted\\r\\nfriend of mine. I am a neighbour.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” continued Svidrigaïlov, shaking with laughter. “I assure you\\r\\non my honour, dear Rodion Romanovitch, that you have interested me\\r\\nenormously. I told you we should become friends, I foretold it. Well,\\r\\nhere we have. And you will see what an accommodating person I am. You’ll\\r\\nsee that you can get on with me!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART VI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\nA strange period began for Raskolnikov: it was as though a fog had\\r\\nfallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there\\r\\nwas no escape. Recalling that period long after, he believed that his\\r\\nmind had been clouded at times, and that it had continued so, with\\r\\nintervals, till the final catastrophe. He was convinced that he had been\\r\\nmistaken about many things at that time, for instance as to the date\\r\\nof certain events. Anyway, when he tried later on to piece his\\r\\nrecollections together, he learnt a great deal about himself from what\\r\\nother people told him. He had mixed up incidents and had explained\\r\\nevents as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination. At\\r\\ntimes he was a prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness, amounting sometimes\\r\\nto panic. But he remembered, too, moments, hours, perhaps whole days,\\r\\nof complete apathy, which came upon him as a reaction from his previous\\r\\nterror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility, sometimes\\r\\nseen in the dying. He seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape\\r\\nfrom a full and clear understanding of his position. Certain essential\\r\\nfacts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome\\r\\nto him. How glad he would have been to be free from some cares, the\\r\\nneglect of which would have threatened him with complete, inevitable\\r\\nruin.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was particularly worried about Svidrigaïlov, he might be said to be\\r\\npermanently thinking of Svidrigaïlov. From the time of Svidrigaïlov’s\\r\\ntoo menacing and unmistakable words in Sonia’s room at the moment of\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna’s death, the normal working of his mind seemed to\\r\\nbreak down. But although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness,\\r\\nRaskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it. At times, finding\\r\\nhimself in a solitary and remote part of the town, in some wretched\\r\\neating-house, sitting alone lost in thought, hardly knowing how he had\\r\\ncome there, he suddenly thought of Svidrigaïlov. He recognised\\r\\nsuddenly, clearly, and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an\\r\\nunderstanding with that man and to make what terms he could. Walking\\r\\noutside the city gates one day, he positively fancied that they had\\r\\nfixed a meeting there, that he was waiting for Svidrigaïlov. Another\\r\\ntime he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes\\r\\nand could not at first understand how he had come there.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanovna’s death, he\\r\\nhad two or three times met Svidrigaïlov at Sonia’s lodging, where he\\r\\nhad gone aimlessly for a moment. They exchanged a few words and made no\\r\\nreference to the vital subject, as though they were tacitly agreed not\\r\\nto speak of it for a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna’s body was still lying in the coffin, Svidrigaïlov was\\r\\nbusy making arrangements for the funeral. Sonia too was very busy. At\\r\\ntheir last meeting Svidrigaïlov informed Raskolnikov that he had made\\r\\nan arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna’s\\r\\nchildren; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded in getting\\r\\nhold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at\\r\\nonce placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he had settled\\r\\non them had been of great assistance, as it is much easier to place\\r\\norphans with some property than destitute ones. He said something\\r\\ntoo about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see\\r\\nRaskolnikov, mentioning that “he would like to consult with him, that\\r\\nthere were things they must talk over....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis conversation took place in the passage on the stairs. Svidrigaïlov\\r\\nlooked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, after a brief pause,\\r\\ndropping his voice, asked: “But how is it, Rodion Romanovitch; you\\r\\ndon’t seem yourself? You look and you listen, but you don’t seem to\\r\\nunderstand. Cheer up! We’ll talk things over; I am only sorry, I’ve\\r\\nso much to do of my own business and other people’s. Ah, Rodion\\r\\nRomanovitch,” he added suddenly, “what all men need is fresh air, fresh\\r\\nair... more than anything!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe moved to one side to make way for the priest and server, who\\r\\nwere coming up the stairs. They had come for the requiem service. By\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov’s orders it was sung twice a day punctually. Svidrigaïlov\\r\\nwent his way. Raskolnikov stood still a moment, thought, and followed\\r\\nthe priest into Sonia’s room. He stood at the door. They began quietly,\\r\\nslowly and mournfully singing the service. From his childhood the\\r\\nthought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive\\r\\nand mysteriously awful; and it was long since he had heard the requiem\\r\\nservice. And there was something else here as well, too awful and\\r\\ndisturbing. He looked at the children: they were all kneeling by the\\r\\ncoffin; Polenka was weeping. Behind them Sonia prayed, softly and, as it\\r\\nwere, timidly weeping.\\r\\n\\r\\n“These last two days she hasn’t said a word to me, she hasn’t glanced at\\r\\nme,” Raskolnikov thought suddenly. The sunlight was bright in the room;\\r\\nthe incense rose in clouds; the priest read, “Give rest, oh Lord....”\\r\\n Raskolnikov stayed all through the service. As he blessed them and\\r\\ntook his leave, the priest looked round strangely. After the service,\\r\\nRaskolnikov went up to Sonia. She took both his hands and let her\\r\\nhead sink on his shoulder. This slight friendly gesture bewildered\\r\\nRaskolnikov. It seemed strange to him that there was no trace of\\r\\nrepugnance, no trace of disgust, no tremor in her hand. It was the\\r\\nfurthest limit of self-abnegation, at least so he interpreted it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia said nothing. Raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out. He felt\\r\\nvery miserable. If it had been possible to escape to some solitude, he\\r\\nwould have thought himself lucky, even if he had to spend his whole life\\r\\nthere. But although he had almost always been by himself of late, he had\\r\\nnever been able to feel alone. Sometimes he walked out of the town on to\\r\\nthe high road, once he had even reached a little wood, but the lonelier\\r\\nthe place was, the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near\\r\\nhim. It did not frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so that he\\r\\nmade haste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to enter\\r\\nrestaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thoroughfares. There he felt\\r\\neasier and even more solitary. One day at dusk he sat for an hour\\r\\nlistening to songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positively\\r\\nenjoyed it. But at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again,\\r\\nas though his conscience smote him. “Here I sit listening to singing,\\r\\nis that what I ought to be doing?” he thought. Yet he felt at once\\r\\nthat that was not the only cause of his uneasiness; there was something\\r\\nrequiring immediate decision, but it was something he could not clearly\\r\\nunderstand or put into words. It was a hopeless tangle. “No, better the\\r\\nstruggle again! Better Porfiry again... or Svidrigaïlov.... Better some\\r\\nchallenge again... some attack. Yes, yes!” he thought. He went out of\\r\\nthe tavern and rushed away almost at a run. The thought of Dounia and\\r\\nhis mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic. That night he woke\\r\\nup before morning among some bushes in Krestovsky Island, trembling\\r\\nall over with fever; he walked home, and it was early morning when he\\r\\narrived. After some hours’ sleep the fever left him, but he woke up\\r\\nlate, two o’clock in the afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe remembered that Katerina Ivanovna’s funeral had been fixed for that\\r\\nday, and was glad that he was not present at it. Nastasya brought him\\r\\nsome food; he ate and drank with appetite, almost with greediness. His\\r\\nhead was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last three\\r\\ndays. He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door opened and Razumihin came in.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, he’s eating, then he’s not ill,” said Razumihin. He took a chair\\r\\nand sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it. He spoke with evident\\r\\nannoyance, but without hurry or raising his voice. He looked as though\\r\\nhe had some special fixed determination.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen,” he began resolutely. “As far as I am concerned, you may all go\\r\\nto hell, but from what I see, it’s clear to me that I can’t make head or\\r\\ntail of it; please don’t think I’ve come to ask you questions. I don’t\\r\\nwant to know, hang it! If you begin telling me your secrets, I dare say\\r\\nI shouldn’t stay to listen, I should go away cursing. I have only come\\r\\nto find out once for all whether it’s a fact that you are mad? There is\\r\\na conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so. I admit\\r\\nI’ve been disposed to that opinion myself, judging from your stupid,\\r\\nrepulsive and quite inexplicable actions, and from your recent behavior\\r\\nto your mother and sister. Only a monster or a madman could treat them\\r\\nas you have; so you must be mad.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When did you see them last?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just now. Haven’t you seen them since then? What have you been doing\\r\\nwith yourself? Tell me, please. I’ve been to you three times already.\\r\\nYour mother has been seriously ill since yesterday. She had made up\\r\\nher mind to come to you; Avdotya Romanovna tried to prevent her; she\\r\\nwouldn’t hear a word. ‘If he is ill, if his mind is giving way, who can\\r\\nlook after him like his mother?’ she said. We all came here together, we\\r\\ncouldn’t let her come alone all the way. We kept begging her to be calm.\\r\\nWe came in, you weren’t here; she sat down, and stayed ten minutes,\\r\\nwhile we stood waiting in silence. She got up and said: ‘If he’s\\r\\ngone out, that is, if he is well, and has forgotten his mother, it’s\\r\\nhumiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging for\\r\\nkindness.’ She returned home and took to her bed; now she is in a fever.\\r\\n‘I see,’ she said, ‘that he has time for _his girl_.’ She means by _your\\r\\ngirl_ Sofya Semyonovna, your betrothed or your mistress, I don’t know. I\\r\\nwent at once to Sofya Semyonovna’s, for I wanted to know what was going\\r\\non. I looked round, I saw the coffin, the children crying, and\\r\\nSofya Semyonovna trying them on mourning dresses. No sign of you. I\\r\\napologised, came away, and reported to Avdotya Romanovna. So that’s all\\r\\nnonsense and you haven’t got a girl; the most likely thing is that you\\r\\nare mad. But here you sit, guzzling boiled beef as though you’d not had\\r\\na bite for three days. Though as far as that goes, madmen eat too, but\\r\\nthough you have not said a word to me yet... you are not mad! That I’d\\r\\nswear! Above all, you are not mad! So you may go to hell, all of you,\\r\\nfor there’s some mystery, some secret about it, and I don’t intend to\\r\\nworry my brains over your secrets. So I’ve simply come to swear at you,”\\r\\n he finished, getting up, “to relieve my mind. And I know what to do\\r\\nnow.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean to do now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What business is it of yours what I mean to do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are going in for a drinking bout.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How... how did you know?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, it’s pretty plain.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRazumihin paused for a minute.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You always have been a very rational person and you’ve never been mad,\\r\\nnever,” he observed suddenly with warmth. “You’re right: I shall drink.\\r\\nGood-bye!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he moved to go out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was talking with my sister--the day before yesterday, I think it\\r\\nwas--about you, Razumihin.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“About me! But... where can you have seen her the day before yesterday?”\\r\\n Razumihin stopped short and even turned a little pale.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne could see that his heart was throbbing slowly and violently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She came here by herself, sat there and talked to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She did!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did you say to her... I mean, about me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I told her you were a very good, honest, and industrious man. I didn’t\\r\\ntell her you love her, because she knows that herself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She knows that herself?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it’s pretty plain. Wherever I might go, whatever happened to me,\\r\\nyou would remain to look after them. I, so to speak, give them into your\\r\\nkeeping, Razumihin. I say this because I know quite well how you love\\r\\nher, and am convinced of the purity of your heart. I know that she too\\r\\nmay love you and perhaps does love you already. Now decide for yourself,\\r\\nas you know best, whether you need go in for a drinking bout or not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rodya! You see... well.... Ach, damn it! But where do you mean to go?\\r\\nOf course, if it’s all a secret, never mind.... But I... I shall find\\r\\nout the secret... and I am sure that it must be some ridiculous nonsense\\r\\nand that you’ve made it all up. Anyway you are a capital fellow, a\\r\\ncapital fellow!...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was just what I wanted to add, only you interrupted, that that was\\r\\na very good decision of yours not to find out these secrets. Leave it to\\r\\ntime, don’t worry about it. You’ll know it all in time when it must be.\\r\\nYesterday a man said to me that what a man needs is fresh air, fresh\\r\\nair, fresh air. I mean to go to him directly to find out what he meant\\r\\nby that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRazumihin stood lost in thought and excitement, making a silent\\r\\nconclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s a political conspirator! He must be. And he’s on the eve of some\\r\\ndesperate step, that’s certain. It can only be that! And... and Dounia\\r\\nknows,” he thought suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So Avdotya Romanovna comes to see you,” he said, weighing each\\r\\nsyllable, “and you’re going to see a man who says we need more air, and\\r\\nso of course that letter... that too must have something to do with it,”\\r\\n he concluded to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What letter?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She got a letter to-day. It upset her very much--very much indeed. Too\\r\\nmuch so. I began speaking of you, she begged me not to. Then... then\\r\\nshe said that perhaps we should very soon have to part... then she began\\r\\nwarmly thanking me for something; then she went to her room and locked\\r\\nherself in.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She got a letter?” Raskolnikov asked thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, and you didn’t know? hm...”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were both silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-bye, Rodion. There was a time, brother, when I.... Never mind,\\r\\ngood-bye. You see, there was a time.... Well, good-bye! I must be off\\r\\ntoo. I am not going to drink. There’s no need now.... That’s all stuff!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hurried out; but when he had almost closed the door behind him, he\\r\\nsuddenly opened it again, and said, looking away:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, by the way, do you remember that murder, you know Porfiry’s, that\\r\\nold woman? Do you know the murderer has been found, he has confessed\\r\\nand given the proofs. It’s one of those very workmen, the painter, only\\r\\nfancy! Do you remember I defended them here? Would you believe it, all\\r\\nthat scene of fighting and laughing with his companions on the stairs\\r\\nwhile the porter and the two witnesses were going up, he got up on\\r\\npurpose to disarm suspicion. The cunning, the presence of mind of the\\r\\nyoung dog! One can hardly credit it; but it’s his own explanation, he\\r\\nhas confessed it all. And what a fool I was about it! Well, he’s simply\\r\\na genius of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspicions of\\r\\nthe lawyers--so there’s nothing much to wonder at, I suppose! Of course\\r\\npeople like that are always possible. And the fact that he couldn’t keep\\r\\nup the character, but confessed, makes him easier to believe in. But\\r\\nwhat a fool I was! I was frantic on their side!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell me, please, from whom did you hear that, and why does it interest\\r\\nyou so?” Raskolnikov asked with unmistakable agitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What next? You ask me why it interests me!... Well, I heard it from\\r\\nPorfiry, among others... It was from him I heard almost all about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“From Porfiry?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“From Porfiry.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What... what did he say?” Raskolnikov asked in dismay.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He gave me a capital explanation of it. Psychologically, after his\\r\\nfashion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He explained it? Explained it himself?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes; good-bye. I’ll tell you all about it another time, but now\\r\\nI’m busy. There was a time when I fancied... But no matter, another\\r\\ntime!... What need is there for me to drink now? You have made me drunk\\r\\nwithout wine. I am drunk, Rodya! Good-bye, I’m going. I’ll come again\\r\\nvery soon.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s a political conspirator, there’s not a doubt about it,” Razumihin\\r\\ndecided, as he slowly descended the stairs. “And he’s drawn his sister\\r\\nin; that’s quite, quite in keeping with Avdotya Romanovna’s character.\\r\\nThere are interviews between them!... She hinted at it too... So many of\\r\\nher words.... and hints... bear that meaning! And how else can all this\\r\\ntangle be explained? Hm! And I was almost thinking... Good heavens,\\r\\nwhat I thought! Yes, I took leave of my senses and I wronged him! It was\\r\\nhis doing, under the lamp in the corridor that day. Pfoo! What a crude,\\r\\nnasty, vile idea on my part! Nikolay is a brick, for confessing.... And\\r\\nhow clear it all is now! His illness then, all his strange actions...\\r\\nbefore this, in the university, how morose he used to be, how gloomy....\\r\\nBut what’s the meaning now of that letter? There’s something in that,\\r\\ntoo, perhaps. Whom was it from? I suspect...! No, I must find out!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought of Dounia, realising all he had heard and his heart throbbed,\\r\\nand he suddenly broke into a run.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Razumihin went out, Raskolnikov got up, turned to the window,\\r\\nwalked into one corner and then into another, as though forgetting the\\r\\nsmallness of his room, and sat down again on the sofa. He felt, so to\\r\\nspeak, renewed; again the struggle, so a means of escape had come.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, a means of escape had come! It had been too stifling, too\\r\\ncramping, the burden had been too agonising. A lethargy had come upon\\r\\nhim at times. From the moment of the scene with Nikolay at Porfiry’s he\\r\\nhad been suffocating, penned in without hope of escape. After Nikolay’s\\r\\nconfession, on that very day had come the scene with Sonia; his\\r\\nbehaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike anything he\\r\\ncould have imagined beforehand; he had grown feebler, instantly and\\r\\nfundamentally! And he had agreed at the time with Sonia, he had agreed\\r\\nin his heart he could not go on living alone with such a thing on his\\r\\nmind!\\r\\n\\r\\n“And Svidrigaïlov was a riddle... He worried him, that was true, but\\r\\nsomehow not on the same point. He might still have a struggle to come\\r\\nwith Svidrigaïlov. Svidrigaïlov, too, might be a means of escape; but\\r\\nPorfiry was a different matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And so Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumihin, had explained it\\r\\n_psychologically_. He had begun bringing in his damned psychology again!\\r\\nPorfiry? But to think that Porfiry should for one moment believe that\\r\\nNikolay was guilty, after what had passed between them before Nikolay’s\\r\\nappearance, after that tête-à-tête interview, which could have only\\r\\n_one_ explanation? (During those days Raskolnikov had often recalled\\r\\npassages in that scene with Porfiry; he could not bear to let his mind\\r\\nrest on it.) Such words, such gestures had passed between them, they\\r\\nhad exchanged such glances, things had been said in such a tone and had\\r\\nreached such a pass, that Nikolay, whom Porfiry had seen through at the\\r\\nfirst word, at the first gesture, could not have shaken his conviction.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And to think that even Razumihin had begun to suspect! The scene in the\\r\\ncorridor under the lamp had produced its effect then. He had rushed to\\r\\nPorfiry.... But what had induced the latter to receive him like that?\\r\\nWhat had been his object in putting Razumihin off with Nikolay? He must\\r\\nhave some plan; there was some design, but what was it? It was true that\\r\\na long time had passed since that morning--too long a time--and no sight\\r\\nnor sound of Porfiry. Well, that was a bad sign....”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room, still pondering. It\\r\\nwas the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in his mind,\\r\\nat least. “I must settle Svidrigaïlov,” he thought, “and as soon as\\r\\npossible; he, too, seems to be waiting for me to come to him of my own\\r\\naccord.” And at that moment there was such a rush of hate in his\\r\\nweary heart that he might have killed either of those two--Porfiry or\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov. At least he felt that he would be capable of doing it\\r\\nlater, if not now.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We shall see, we shall see,” he repeated to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled upon Porfiry\\r\\nhimself in the passage. He was coming in to see him. Raskolnikov was\\r\\ndumbfounded for a minute, but only for one minute. Strange to say, he\\r\\nwas not very much astonished at seeing Porfiry and scarcely afraid of\\r\\nhim. He was simply startled, but was quickly, instantly, on his guard.\\r\\n“Perhaps this will mean the end? But how could Porfiry have approached\\r\\nso quietly, like a cat, so that he had heard nothing? Could he have been\\r\\nlistening at the door?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You didn’t expect a visitor, Rodion Romanovitch,” Porfiry explained,\\r\\nlaughing. “I’ve been meaning to look in a long time; I was passing by\\r\\nand thought why not go in for five minutes. Are you going out? I won’t\\r\\nkeep you long. Just let me have one cigarette.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sit down, Porfiry Petrovitch, sit down.” Raskolnikov gave his visitor\\r\\na seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would have\\r\\nmarvelled at himself, if he could have seen it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last moment had come, the last drops had to be drained! So a man\\r\\nwill sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand,\\r\\nyet when the knife is at his throat at last, he feels no fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov seated himself directly facing Porfiry, and looked at him\\r\\nwithout flinching. Porfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting a\\r\\ncigarette.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Speak, speak,” seemed as though it would burst from Raskolnikov’s\\r\\nheart. “Come, why don’t you speak?”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah these cigarettes!” Porfiry Petrovitch ejaculated at last, having\\r\\nlighted one. “They are pernicious, positively pernicious, and yet I\\r\\ncan’t give them up! I cough, I begin to have tickling in my throat and\\r\\na difficulty in breathing. You know I am a coward, I went lately to\\r\\nDr. B----n; he always gives at least half an hour to each patient. He\\r\\npositively laughed looking at me; he sounded me: ‘Tobacco’s bad for\\r\\nyou,’ he said, ‘your lungs are affected.’ But how am I to give it up?\\r\\nWhat is there to take its place? I don’t drink, that’s the mischief,\\r\\nhe-he-he, that I don’t. Everything is relative, Rodion Romanovitch,\\r\\neverything is relative!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, he’s playing his professional tricks again,” Raskolnikov thought\\r\\nwith disgust. All the circumstances of their last interview suddenly\\r\\ncame back to him, and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon\\r\\nhim then.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I came to see you the day before yesterday, in the evening; you didn’t\\r\\nknow?” Porfiry Petrovitch went on, looking round the room. “I came into\\r\\nthis very room. I was passing by, just as I did to-day, and I thought\\r\\nI’d return your call. I walked in as your door was wide open, I looked\\r\\nround, waited and went out without leaving my name with your servant.\\r\\nDon’t you lock your door?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov’s face grew more and more gloomy. Porfiry seemed to guess\\r\\nhis state of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve come to have it out with you, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow!\\r\\nI owe you an explanation and must give it to you,” he continued with a\\r\\nslight smile, just patting Raskolnikov’s knee.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his\\r\\nface; to his surprise Raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it. He had\\r\\nnever seen and never suspected such an expression in his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A strange scene passed between us last time we met, Rodion Romanovitch.\\r\\nOur first interview, too, was a strange one; but then... and one thing\\r\\nafter another! This is the point: I have perhaps acted unfairly to you;\\r\\nI feel it. Do you remember how we parted? Your nerves were unhinged and\\r\\nyour knees were shaking and so were mine. And, you know, our behaviour\\r\\nwas unseemly, even ungentlemanly. And yet we are gentlemen, above all,\\r\\nin any case, gentlemen; that must be understood. Do you remember what we\\r\\ncame to?... and it was quite indecorous.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is he up to, what does he take me for?” Raskolnikov asked himself\\r\\nin amazement, raising his head and looking with open eyes on Porfiry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve decided openness is better between us,” Porfiry Petrovitch went\\r\\non, turning his head away and dropping his eyes, as though unwilling to\\r\\ndisconcert his former victim and as though disdaining his former wiles.\\r\\n“Yes, such suspicions and such scenes cannot continue for long. Nikolay\\r\\nput a stop to it, or I don’t know what we might not have come to. That\\r\\ndamned workman was sitting at the time in the next room--can you realise\\r\\nthat? You know that, of course; and I am aware that he came to you\\r\\nafterwards. But what you supposed then was not true: I had not sent for\\r\\nanyone, I had made no kind of arrangements. You ask why I hadn’t? What\\r\\nshall I say to you? it had all come upon me so suddenly. I had scarcely\\r\\nsent for the porters (you noticed them as you went out, I dare say).\\r\\nAn idea flashed upon me; I was firmly convinced at the time, you see,\\r\\nRodion Romanovitch. Come, I thought--even if I let one thing slip for\\r\\na time, I shall get hold of something else--I shan’t lose what I want,\\r\\nanyway. You are nervously irritable, Rodion Romanovitch, by temperament;\\r\\nit’s out of proportion with other qualities of your heart and character,\\r\\nwhich I flatter myself I have to some extent divined. Of course I did\\r\\nreflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and\\r\\nblurts out his whole story. It does happen sometimes, if you make a\\r\\nman lose all patience, though even then it’s rare. I was capable of\\r\\nrealising that. If I only had a fact, I thought, the least little fact\\r\\nto go upon, something I could lay hold of, something tangible, not\\r\\nmerely psychological. For if a man is guilty, you must be able to get\\r\\nsomething substantial out of him; one may reckon upon most surprising\\r\\nresults indeed. I was reckoning on your temperament, Rodion Romanovitch,\\r\\non your temperament above all things! I had great hopes of you at that\\r\\ntime.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what are you driving at now?” Raskolnikov muttered at last, asking\\r\\nthe question without thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is he talking about?” he wondered distractedly, “does he really\\r\\ntake me to be innocent?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What am I driving at? I’ve come to explain myself, I consider it my\\r\\nduty, so to speak. I want to make clear to you how the whole business,\\r\\nthe whole misunderstanding arose. I’ve caused you a great deal of\\r\\nsuffering, Rodion Romanovitch. I am not a monster. I understand what\\r\\nit must mean for a man who has been unfortunate, but who is proud,\\r\\nimperious and above all, impatient, to have to bear such treatment!\\r\\nI regard you in any case as a man of noble character and not without\\r\\nelements of magnanimity, though I don’t agree with all your convictions.\\r\\nI wanted to tell you this first, frankly and quite sincerely, for above\\r\\nall I don’t want to deceive you. When I made your acquaintance, I felt\\r\\nattracted by you. Perhaps you will laugh at my saying so. You have a\\r\\nright to. I know you disliked me from the first and indeed you’ve no\\r\\nreason to like me. You may think what you like, but I desire now to do\\r\\nall I can to efface that impression and to show that I am a man of heart\\r\\nand conscience. I speak sincerely.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPorfiry Petrovitch made a dignified pause. Raskolnikov felt a rush of\\r\\nrenewed alarm. The thought that Porfiry believed him to be innocent\\r\\nbegan to make him uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail,” Porfiry\\r\\nPetrovitch went on. “Indeed, I could scarcely attempt it. To begin with\\r\\nthere were rumours. Through whom, how, and when those rumours came to\\r\\nme... and how they affected you, I need not go into. My suspicions\\r\\nwere aroused by a complete accident, which might just as easily not have\\r\\nhappened. What was it? Hm! I believe there is no need to go into that\\r\\neither. Those rumours and that accident led to one idea in my mind. I\\r\\nadmit it openly--for one may as well make a clean breast of it--I was\\r\\nthe first to pitch on you. The old woman’s notes on the pledges and\\r\\nthe rest of it--that all came to nothing. Yours was one of a hundred.\\r\\nI happened, too, to hear of the scene at the office, from a man who\\r\\ndescribed it capitally, unconsciously reproducing the scene with great\\r\\nvividness. It was just one thing after another, Rodion Romanovitch, my\\r\\ndear fellow! How could I avoid being brought to certain ideas? From a\\r\\nhundred rabbits you can’t make a horse, a hundred suspicions don’t make\\r\\na proof, as the English proverb says, but that’s only from the rational\\r\\npoint of view--you can’t help being partial, for after all a lawyer\\r\\nis only human. I thought, too, of your article in that journal, do you\\r\\nremember, on your first visit we talked of it? I jeered at you at the\\r\\ntime, but that was only to lead you on. I repeat, Rodion Romanovitch,\\r\\nyou are ill and impatient. That you were bold, headstrong, in earnest\\r\\nand... had felt a great deal I recognised long before. I, too, have felt\\r\\nthe same, so that your article seemed familiar to me. It was conceived\\r\\non sleepless nights, with a throbbing heart, in ecstasy and suppressed\\r\\nenthusiasm. And that proud suppressed enthusiasm in young people is\\r\\ndangerous! I jeered at you then, but let me tell you that, as a literary\\r\\namateur, I am awfully fond of such first essays, full of the heat of\\r\\nyouth. There is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist. Your\\r\\narticle is absurd and fantastic, but there’s a transparent sincerity,\\r\\na youthful incorruptible pride and the daring of despair in it. It’s a\\r\\ngloomy article, but that’s what’s fine in it. I read your article and\\r\\nput it aside, thinking as I did so ‘that man won’t go the common way.’\\r\\nWell, I ask you, after that as a preliminary, how could I help being\\r\\ncarried away by what followed? Oh, dear, I am not saying anything, I\\r\\nam not making any statement now. I simply noted it at the time. What is\\r\\nthere in it? I reflected. There’s nothing in it, that is really nothing\\r\\nand perhaps absolutely nothing. And it’s not at all the thing for\\r\\nthe prosecutor to let himself be carried away by notions: here I have\\r\\nNikolay on my hands with actual evidence against him--you may think what\\r\\nyou like of it, but it’s evidence. He brings in his psychology, too; one\\r\\nhas to consider him, too, for it’s a matter of life and death. Why am\\r\\nI explaining this to you? That you may understand, and not blame my\\r\\nmalicious behaviour on that occasion. It was not malicious, I assure\\r\\nyou, he-he! Do you suppose I didn’t come to search your room at the\\r\\ntime? I did, I did, he-he! I was here when you were lying ill in bed,\\r\\nnot officially, not in my own person, but I was here. Your room was\\r\\nsearched to the last thread at the first suspicion; but _umsonst_! I\\r\\nthought to myself, now that man will come, will come of himself and\\r\\nquickly, too; if he’s guilty, he’s sure to come. Another man wouldn’t,\\r\\nbut he will. And you remember how Mr. Razumihin began discussing the\\r\\nsubject with you? We arranged that to excite you, so we purposely spread\\r\\nrumours, that he might discuss the case with you, and Razumihin is not a\\r\\nman to restrain his indignation. Mr. Zametov was tremendously struck by\\r\\nyour anger and your open daring. Think of blurting out in a restaurant\\r\\n‘I killed her.’ It was too daring, too reckless. I thought so myself, if\\r\\nhe is guilty he will be a formidable opponent. That was what I thought\\r\\nat the time. I was expecting you. But you simply bowled Zametov over\\r\\nand... well, you see, it all lies in this--that this damnable psychology\\r\\ncan be taken two ways! Well, I kept expecting you, and so it was, you\\r\\ncame! My heart was fairly throbbing. Ach!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, why need you have come? Your laughter, too, as you came in, do you\\r\\nremember? I saw it all plain as daylight, but if I hadn’t expected you\\r\\nso specially, I should not have noticed anything in your laughter. You\\r\\nsee what influence a mood has! Mr. Razumihin then--ah, that stone, that\\r\\nstone under which the things were hidden! I seem to see it somewhere\\r\\nin a kitchen garden. It was in a kitchen garden, you told Zametov and\\r\\nafterwards you repeated that in my office? And when we began picking\\r\\nyour article to pieces, how you explained it! One could take every word\\r\\nof yours in two senses, as though there were another meaning hidden.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So in this way, Rodion Romanovitch, I reached the furthest limit, and\\r\\nknocking my head against a post, I pulled myself up, asking myself what\\r\\nI was about. After all, I said, you can take it all in another sense if\\r\\nyou like, and it’s more natural so, indeed. I couldn’t help admitting\\r\\nit was more natural. I was bothered! ‘No, I’d better get hold of some\\r\\nlittle fact’ I said. So when I heard of the bell-ringing, I held my\\r\\nbreath and was all in a tremor. ‘Here is my little fact,’ thought I, and\\r\\nI didn’t think it over, I simply wouldn’t. I would have given a thousand\\r\\nroubles at that minute to have seen you with my own eyes, when you\\r\\nwalked a hundred paces beside that workman, after he had called you\\r\\nmurderer to your face, and you did not dare to ask him a question\\r\\nall the way. And then what about your trembling, what about your\\r\\nbell-ringing in your illness, in semi-delirium?\\r\\n\\r\\n“And so, Rodion Romanovitch, can you wonder that I played such pranks on\\r\\nyou? And what made you come at that very minute? Someone seemed to\\r\\nhave sent you, by Jove! And if Nikolay had not parted us... and do you\\r\\nremember Nikolay at the time? Do you remember him clearly? It was a\\r\\nthunderbolt, a regular thunderbolt! And how I met him! I didn’t believe\\r\\nin the thunderbolt, not for a minute. You could see it for yourself;\\r\\nand how could I? Even afterwards, when you had gone and he began making\\r\\nvery, very plausible answers on certain points, so that I was surprised\\r\\nat him myself, even then I didn’t believe his story! You see what it is\\r\\nto be as firm as a rock! No, thought I, _Morgenfrüh_. What has Nikolay\\r\\ngot to do with it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Razumihin told me just now that you think Nikolay guilty and had\\r\\nyourself assured him of it....”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis voice failed him, and he broke off. He had been listening in\\r\\nindescribable agitation, as this man who had seen through and through\\r\\nhim, went back upon himself. He was afraid of believing it and did not\\r\\nbelieve it. In those still ambiguous words he kept eagerly looking for\\r\\nsomething more definite and conclusive.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Razumihin!” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, seeming glad of a question\\r\\nfrom Raskolnikov, who had till then been silent. “He-he-he! But I had to\\r\\nput Mr. Razumihin off; two is company, three is none. Mr. Razumihin is\\r\\nnot the right man, besides he is an outsider. He came running to me\\r\\nwith a pale face.... But never mind him, why bring him in? To return\\r\\nto Nikolay, would you like to know what sort of a type he is, how I\\r\\nunderstand him, that is? To begin with, he is still a child and not\\r\\nexactly a coward, but something by way of an artist. Really, don’t laugh\\r\\nat my describing him so. He is innocent and responsive to influence. He\\r\\nhas a heart, and is a fantastic fellow. He sings and dances, he tells\\r\\nstories, they say, so that people come from other villages to hear him.\\r\\nHe attends school too, and laughs till he cries if you hold up a finger\\r\\nto him; he will drink himself senseless--not as a regular vice, but at\\r\\ntimes, when people treat him, like a child. And he stole, too, then,\\r\\nwithout knowing it himself, for ‘How can it be stealing, if one picks it\\r\\nup?’ And do you know he is an Old Believer, or rather a dissenter? There\\r\\nhave been Wanderers[*] in his family, and he was for two years in his\\r\\nvillage under the spiritual guidance of a certain elder. I learnt all\\r\\nthis from Nikolay and from his fellow villagers. And what’s more, he\\r\\nwanted to run into the wilderness! He was full of fervour, prayed at\\r\\nnight, read the old books, ‘the true’ ones, and read himself crazy.\\r\\n\\r\\n     [*] A religious sect.--TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Petersburg had a great effect upon him, especially the women and the\\r\\nwine. He responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that. I\\r\\nlearnt that an artist here took a fancy to him, and used to go and see\\r\\nhim, and now this business came upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, he was frightened, he tried to hang himself! He ran away! How can\\r\\none get over the idea the people have of Russian legal proceedings? The\\r\\nvery word ‘trial’ frightens some of them. Whose fault is it? We shall\\r\\nsee what the new juries will do. God grant they do good! Well, in\\r\\nprison, it seems, he remembered the venerable elder; the Bible, too,\\r\\nmade its appearance again. Do you know, Rodion Romanovitch, the force of\\r\\nthe word ‘suffering’ among some of these people! It’s not a question of\\r\\nsuffering for someone’s benefit, but simply, ‘one must suffer.’ If they\\r\\nsuffer at the hands of the authorities, so much the better. In my time\\r\\nthere was a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in prison\\r\\nalways reading his Bible on the stove at night and he read himself\\r\\ncrazy, and so crazy, do you know, that one day, apropos of nothing, he\\r\\nseized a brick and flung it at the governor; though he had done him\\r\\nno harm. And the way he threw it too: aimed it a yard on one side\\r\\non purpose, for fear of hurting him. Well, we know what happens to\\r\\na prisoner who assaults an officer with a weapon. So ‘he took his\\r\\nsuffering.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“So I suspect now that Nikolay wants to take his suffering or something\\r\\nof the sort. I know it for certain from facts, indeed. Only he doesn’t\\r\\nknow that I know. What, you don’t admit that there are such fantastic\\r\\npeople among the peasants? Lots of them. The elder now has begun\\r\\ninfluencing him, especially since he tried to hang himself. But he’ll\\r\\ncome and tell me all himself. You think he’ll hold out? Wait a bit,\\r\\nhe’ll take his words back. I am waiting from hour to hour for him to\\r\\ncome and abjure his evidence. I have come to like that Nikolay and am\\r\\nstudying him in detail. And what do you think? He-he! He answered me\\r\\nvery plausibly on some points, he obviously had collected some evidence\\r\\nand prepared himself cleverly. But on other points he is simply at sea,\\r\\nknows nothing and doesn’t even suspect that he doesn’t know!\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, Rodion Romanovitch, Nikolay doesn’t come in! This is a fantastic,\\r\\ngloomy business, a modern case, an incident of to-day when the heart\\r\\nof man is troubled, when the phrase is quoted that blood ‘renews,’ when\\r\\ncomfort is preached as the aim of life. Here we have bookish dreams, a\\r\\nheart unhinged by theories. Here we see resolution in the first stage,\\r\\nbut resolution of a special kind: he resolved to do it like jumping over\\r\\na precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the\\r\\ncrime. He forgot to shut the door after him, and murdered two people for\\r\\na theory. He committed the murder and couldn’t take the money, and what\\r\\nhe did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone. It wasn’t enough for\\r\\nhim to suffer agony behind the door while they battered at the door and\\r\\nrung the bell, no, he had to go to the empty lodging, half delirious, to\\r\\nrecall the bell-ringing, he wanted to feel the cold shiver over again....\\r\\nWell, that we grant, was through illness, but consider this: he is\\r\\na murderer, but looks upon himself as an honest man, despises others,\\r\\nposes as injured innocence. No, that’s not the work of a Nikolay, my\\r\\ndear Rodion Romanovitch!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAll that had been said before had sounded so like a recantation that\\r\\nthese words were too great a shock. Raskolnikov shuddered as though he\\r\\nhad been stabbed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then... who then... is the murderer?” he asked in a breathless voice,\\r\\nunable to restrain himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nPorfiry Petrovitch sank back in his chair, as though he were amazed at\\r\\nthe question.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who is the murderer?” he repeated, as though unable to believe his\\r\\nears. “Why, _you_, Rodion Romanovitch! You are the murderer,” he added,\\r\\nalmost in a whisper, in a voice of genuine conviction.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov leapt from the sofa, stood up for a few seconds and sat down\\r\\nagain without uttering a word. His face twitched convulsively.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your lip is twitching just as it did before,” Porfiry Petrovitch\\r\\nobserved almost sympathetically. “You’ve been misunderstanding me, I\\r\\nthink, Rodion Romanovitch,” he added after a brief pause, “that’s why\\r\\nyou are so surprised. I came on purpose to tell you everything and deal\\r\\nopenly with you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was not I murdered her,” Raskolnikov whispered like a frightened\\r\\nchild caught in the act.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, it was you, you Rodion Romanovitch, and no one else,” Porfiry\\r\\nwhispered sternly, with conviction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were both silent and the silence lasted strangely long, about ten\\r\\nminutes. Raskolnikov put his elbow on the table and passed his fingers\\r\\nthrough his hair. Porfiry Petrovitch sat quietly waiting. Suddenly\\r\\nRaskolnikov looked scornfully at Porfiry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are at your old tricks again, Porfiry Petrovitch! Your old method\\r\\nagain. I wonder you don’t get sick of it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, stop that, what does that matter now? It would be a different\\r\\nmatter if there were witnesses present, but we are whispering alone. You\\r\\nsee yourself that I have not come to chase and capture you like a hare.\\r\\nWhether you confess it or not is nothing to me now; for myself, I am\\r\\nconvinced without it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If so, what did you come for?” Raskolnikov asked irritably. “I ask you\\r\\nthe same question again: if you consider me guilty, why don’t you take\\r\\nme to prison?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, that’s your question! I will answer you, point for point. In the\\r\\nfirst place, to arrest you so directly is not to my interest.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How so? If you are convinced you ought....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ach, what if I am convinced? That’s only my dream for the time. Why\\r\\nshould I put you in safety? You know that’s it, since you ask me to do\\r\\nit. If I confront you with that workman for instance and you say to him\\r\\n‘were you drunk or not? Who saw me with you? I simply took you to be\\r\\ndrunk, and you were drunk, too.’ Well, what could I answer, especially\\r\\nas your story is a more likely one than his? for there’s nothing but\\r\\npsychology to support his evidence--that’s almost unseemly with his ugly\\r\\nmug, while you hit the mark exactly, for the rascal is an inveterate\\r\\ndrunkard and notoriously so. And I have myself admitted candidly several\\r\\ntimes already that that psychology can be taken in two ways and that the\\r\\nsecond way is stronger and looks far more probable, and that apart from\\r\\nthat I have as yet nothing against you. And though I shall put you in\\r\\nprison and indeed have come--quite contrary to etiquette--to inform you\\r\\nof it beforehand, yet I tell you frankly, also contrary to etiquette,\\r\\nthat it won’t be to my advantage. Well, secondly, I’ve come to you\\r\\nbecause...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes, secondly?” Raskolnikov was listening breathless.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because, as I told you just now, I consider I owe you an explanation. I\\r\\ndon’t want you to look upon me as a monster, as I have a genuine liking\\r\\nfor you, you may believe me or not. And in the third place I’ve come to\\r\\nyou with a direct and open proposition--that you should surrender\\r\\nand confess. It will be infinitely more to your advantage and to my\\r\\nadvantage too, for my task will be done. Well, is this open on my part\\r\\nor not?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov thought a minute.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen, Porfiry Petrovitch. You said just now you have nothing but\\r\\npsychology to go on, yet now you’ve gone on mathematics. Well, what if\\r\\nyou are mistaken yourself, now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, Rodion Romanovitch, I am not mistaken. I have a little fact even\\r\\nthen, Providence sent it me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What little fact?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I won’t tell you what, Rodion Romanovitch. And in any case, I haven’t\\r\\nthe right to put it off any longer, I must arrest you. So think it over:\\r\\nit makes no difference to me _now_ and so I speak only for your sake.\\r\\nBelieve me, it will be better, Rodion Romanovitch.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov smiled malignantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s not simply ridiculous, it’s positively shameless. Why, even if I\\r\\nwere guilty, which I don’t admit, what reason should I have to confess,\\r\\nwhen you tell me yourself that I shall be in greater safety in prison?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, don’t put too much faith in words, perhaps\\r\\nprison will not be altogether a restful place. That’s only theory and\\r\\nmy theory, and what authority am I for you? Perhaps, too, even now I am\\r\\nhiding something from you? I can’t lay bare everything, he-he! And how\\r\\ncan you ask what advantage? Don’t you know how it would lessen your\\r\\nsentence? You would be confessing at a moment when another man has taken\\r\\nthe crime on himself and so has muddled the whole case. Consider that! I\\r\\nswear before God that I will so arrange that your confession shall\\r\\ncome as a complete surprise. We will make a clean sweep of all these\\r\\npsychological points, of a suspicion against you, so that your crime\\r\\nwill appear to have been something like an aberration, for in truth it\\r\\nwas an aberration. I am an honest man, Rodion Romanovitch, and will keep\\r\\nmy word.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his head sink\\r\\ndejectedly. He pondered a long while and at last smiled again, but his\\r\\nsmile was sad and gentle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No!” he said, apparently abandoning all attempt to keep up appearances\\r\\nwith Porfiry, “it’s not worth it, I don’t care about lessening the\\r\\nsentence!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s just what I was afraid of!” Porfiry cried warmly and, as it\\r\\nseemed, involuntarily. “That’s just what I feared, that you wouldn’t\\r\\ncare about the mitigation of sentence.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov looked sadly and expressively at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, don’t disdain life!” Porfiry went on. “You have a great deal of\\r\\nit still before you. How can you say you don’t want a mitigation of\\r\\nsentence? You are an impatient fellow!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A great deal of what lies before me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of life. What sort of prophet are you, do you know much about it? Seek\\r\\nand ye shall find. This may be God’s means for bringing you to Him. And\\r\\nit’s not for ever, the bondage....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The time will be shortened,” laughed Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of? It may be that you\\r\\nare afraid of it without knowing it, because you are young! But anyway\\r\\n_you_ shouldn’t be afraid of giving yourself up and confessing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ach, hang it!” Raskolnikov whispered with loathing and contempt, as\\r\\nthough he did not want to speak aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got up again as though he meant to go away, but sat down again in\\r\\nevident despair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hang it, if you like! You’ve lost faith and you think that I am\\r\\ngrossly flattering you; but how long has your life been? How much do\\r\\nyou understand? You made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke\\r\\ndown and turned out to be not at all original! It turned out something\\r\\nbase, that’s true, but you are not hopelessly base. By no means so base!\\r\\nAt least you didn’t deceive yourself for long, you went straight to the\\r\\nfurthest point at one bound. How do I regard you? I regard you as one\\r\\nof those men who would stand and smile at their torturer while he cuts\\r\\ntheir entrails out, if only they have found faith or God. Find it and\\r\\nyou will live. You have long needed a change of air. Suffering, too,\\r\\nis a good thing. Suffer! Maybe Nikolay is right in wanting to suffer.\\r\\nI know you don’t believe in it--but don’t be over-wise; fling yourself\\r\\nstraight into life, without deliberation; don’t be afraid--the flood\\r\\nwill bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again. What\\r\\nbank? How can I tell? I only believe that you have long life before\\r\\nyou. I know that you take all my words now for a set speech prepared\\r\\nbeforehand, but maybe you will remember them after. They may be of use\\r\\nsome time. That’s why I speak. It’s as well that you only killed the\\r\\nold woman. If you’d invented another theory you might perhaps have\\r\\ndone something a thousand times more hideous. You ought to thank God,\\r\\nperhaps. How do you know? Perhaps God is saving you for something.\\r\\nBut keep a good heart and have less fear! Are you afraid of the great\\r\\nexpiation before you? No, it would be shameful to be afraid of it. Since\\r\\nyou have taken such a step, you must harden your heart. There is justice\\r\\nin it. You must fulfil the demands of justice. I know that you don’t\\r\\nbelieve it, but indeed, life will bring you through. You will live it\\r\\ndown in time. What you need now is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air!”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov positively started.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But who are you? what prophet are you? From the height of what majestic\\r\\ncalm do you proclaim these words of wisdom?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who am I? I am a man with nothing to hope for, that’s all. A man\\r\\nperhaps of feeling and sympathy, maybe of some knowledge too, but my day\\r\\nis over. But you are a different matter, there is life waiting for you.\\r\\nThough, who knows? maybe your life, too, will pass off in smoke and come\\r\\nto nothing. Come, what does it matter, that you will pass into another\\r\\nclass of men? It’s not comfort you regret, with your heart! What of\\r\\nit that perhaps no one will see you for so long? It’s not time, but\\r\\nyourself that will decide that. Be the sun and all will see you. The\\r\\nsun has before all to be the sun. Why are you smiling again? At my being\\r\\nsuch a Schiller? I bet you’re imagining that I am trying to get round\\r\\nyou by flattery. Well, perhaps I am, he-he-he! Perhaps you’d better not\\r\\nbelieve my word, perhaps you’d better never believe it altogether--I’m\\r\\nmade that way, I confess it. But let me add, you can judge for yourself,\\r\\nI think, how far I am a base sort of man and how far I am honest.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When do you mean to arrest me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I can let you walk about another day or two. Think it over, my\\r\\ndear fellow, and pray to God. It’s more in your interest, believe me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what if I run away?” asked Raskolnikov with a strange smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, you won’t run away. A peasant would run away, a fashionable\\r\\ndissenter would run away, the flunkey of another man’s thought, for\\r\\nyou’ve only to show him the end of your little finger and he’ll be ready\\r\\nto believe in anything for the rest of his life. But you’ve ceased to\\r\\nbelieve in your theory already, what will you run away with? And what\\r\\nwould you do in hiding? It would be hateful and difficult for you, and\\r\\nwhat you need more than anything in life is a definite position, an\\r\\natmosphere to suit you. And what sort of atmosphere would you have? If\\r\\nyou ran away, you’d come back to yourself. _You can’t get on without\\r\\nus._ And if I put you in prison--say you’ve been there a month, or two,\\r\\nor three--remember my word, you’ll confess of yourself and perhaps to\\r\\nyour own surprise. You won’t know an hour beforehand that you are coming\\r\\nwith a confession. I am convinced that you will decide, ‘to take your\\r\\nsuffering.’ You don’t believe my words now, but you’ll come to it of\\r\\nyourself. For suffering, Rodion Romanovitch, is a great thing. Never\\r\\nmind my having grown fat, I know all the same. Don’t laugh at it,\\r\\nthere’s an idea in suffering, Nikolay is right. No, you won’t run away,\\r\\nRodion Romanovitch.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov got up and took his cap. Porfiry Petrovitch also rose.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you going for a walk? The evening will be fine, if only we don’t\\r\\nhave a storm. Though it would be a good thing to freshen the air.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, too, took his cap.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Porfiry Petrovitch, please don’t take up the notion that I have\\r\\nconfessed to you to-day,” Raskolnikov pronounced with sullen insistence.\\r\\n“You’re a strange man and I have listened to you from simple curiosity.\\r\\nBut I have admitted nothing, remember that!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I know that, I’ll remember. Look at him, he’s trembling! Don’t\\r\\nbe uneasy, my dear fellow, have it your own way. Walk about a bit, you\\r\\nwon’t be able to walk too far. If anything happens, I have one request\\r\\nto make of you,” he added, dropping his voice. “It’s an awkward one, but\\r\\nimportant. If anything were to happen (though indeed I don’t believe\\r\\nin it and think you quite incapable of it), yet in case you were taken\\r\\nduring these forty or fifty hours with the notion of putting an end to\\r\\nthe business in some other way, in some fantastic fashion--laying hands\\r\\non yourself--(it’s an absurd proposition, but you must forgive me for\\r\\nit) do leave a brief but precise note, only two lines, and mention the\\r\\nstone. It will be more generous. Come, till we meet! Good thoughts and\\r\\nsound decisions to you!”\\r\\n\\r\\nPorfiry went out, stooping and avoiding looking at Raskolnikov. The\\r\\nlatter went to the window and waited with irritable impatience till he\\r\\ncalculated that Porfiry had reached the street and moved away. Then he\\r\\ntoo went hurriedly out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hurried to Svidrigaïlov’s. What he had to hope from that man he\\r\\ndid not know. But that man had some hidden power over him. Having once\\r\\nrecognised this, he could not rest, and now the time had come.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the way, one question particularly worried him: had Svidrigaïlov been\\r\\nto Porfiry’s?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as he could judge, he would swear to it, that he had not. He\\r\\npondered again and again, went over Porfiry’s visit; no, he hadn’t been,\\r\\nof course he hadn’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if he had not been yet, would he go? Meanwhile, for the present he\\r\\nfancied he couldn’t. Why? He could not have explained, but if he could,\\r\\nhe would not have wasted much thought over it at the moment. It all\\r\\nworried him and at the same time he could not attend to it. Strange to\\r\\nsay, none would have believed it perhaps, but he only felt a faint vague\\r\\nanxiety about his immediate future. Another, much more important anxiety\\r\\ntormented him--it concerned himself, but in a different, more vital way.\\r\\nMoreover, he was conscious of immense moral fatigue, though his mind was\\r\\nworking better that morning than it had done of late.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd was it worth while, after all that had happened, to contend with\\r\\nthese new trivial difficulties? Was it worth while, for instance, to\\r\\nmanoeuvre that Svidrigaïlov should not go to Porfiry’s? Was it worth\\r\\nwhile to investigate, to ascertain the facts, to waste time over anyone\\r\\nlike Svidrigaïlov?\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, how sick he was of it all!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet he was hastening to Svidrigaïlov; could he be expecting\\r\\nsomething _new_ from him, information, or means of escape? Men will\\r\\ncatch at straws! Was it destiny or some instinct bringing them together?\\r\\nPerhaps it was only fatigue, despair; perhaps it was not Svidrigaïlov\\r\\nbut some other whom he needed, and Svidrigaïlov had simply presented\\r\\nhimself by chance. Sonia? But what should he go to Sonia for now? To beg\\r\\nher tears again? He was afraid of Sonia, too. Sonia stood before him as\\r\\nan irrevocable sentence. He must go his own way or hers. At that moment\\r\\nespecially he did not feel equal to seeing her. No, would it not be\\r\\nbetter to try Svidrigaïlov? And he could not help inwardly owning that\\r\\nhe had long felt that he must see him for some reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what could they have in common? Their very evil-doing could not\\r\\nbe of the same kind. The man, moreover, was very unpleasant, evidently\\r\\ndepraved, undoubtedly cunning and deceitful, possibly malignant. Such\\r\\nstories were told about him. It is true he was befriending Katerina\\r\\nIvanovna’s children, but who could tell with what motive and what it\\r\\nmeant? The man always had some design, some project.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was another thought which had been continually hovering of late\\r\\nabout Raskolnikov’s mind, and causing him great uneasiness. It was so\\r\\npainful that he made distinct efforts to get rid of it. He sometimes\\r\\nthought that Svidrigaïlov was dogging his footsteps. Svidrigaïlov had\\r\\nfound out his secret and had had designs on Dounia. What if he had them\\r\\nstill? Wasn’t it practically certain that he had? And what if, having\\r\\nlearnt his secret and so having gained power over him, he were to use it\\r\\nas a weapon against Dounia?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis idea sometimes even tormented his dreams, but it had never\\r\\npresented itself so vividly to him as on his way to Svidrigaïlov.\\r\\nThe very thought moved him to gloomy rage. To begin with, this would\\r\\ntransform everything, even his own position; he would have at once to\\r\\nconfess his secret to Dounia. Would he have to give himself up perhaps\\r\\nto prevent Dounia from taking some rash step? The letter? This morning\\r\\nDounia had received a letter. From whom could she get letters in\\r\\nPetersburg? Luzhin, perhaps? It’s true Razumihin was there to protect\\r\\nher, but Razumihin knew nothing of the position. Perhaps it was his duty\\r\\nto tell Razumihin? He thought of it with repugnance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn any case he must see Svidrigaïlov as soon as possible, he decided\\r\\nfinally. Thank God, the details of the interview were of little\\r\\nconsequence, if only he could get at the root of the matter; but\\r\\nif Svidrigaïlov were capable... if he were intriguing against\\r\\nDounia--then...\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov was so exhausted by what he had passed through that month\\r\\nthat he could only decide such questions in one way; “then I shall kill\\r\\nhim,” he thought in cold despair.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sudden anguish oppressed his heart, he stood still in the middle of\\r\\nthe street and began looking about to see where he was and which way he\\r\\nwas going. He found himself in X. Prospect, thirty or forty paces from\\r\\nthe Hay Market, through which he had come. The whole second storey of\\r\\nthe house on the left was used as a tavern. All the windows were wide\\r\\nopen; judging from the figures moving at the windows, the rooms were\\r\\nfull to overflowing. There were sounds of singing, of clarionet and\\r\\nviolin, and the boom of a Turkish drum. He could hear women shrieking.\\r\\nHe was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the X. Prospect,\\r\\nwhen suddenly at one of the end windows he saw Svidrigaïlov, sitting\\r\\nat a tea-table right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth.\\r\\nRaskolnikov was dreadfully taken aback, almost terrified. Svidrigaïlov\\r\\nwas silently watching and scrutinising him and, what struck Raskolnikov\\r\\nat once, seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved.\\r\\nRaskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him, but to be looking\\r\\nabsent-mindedly away, while he watched him out of the corner of his eye.\\r\\nHis heart was beating violently. Yet, it was evident that Svidrigaïlov\\r\\ndid not want to be seen. He took the pipe out of his mouth and was on\\r\\nthe point of concealing himself, but as he got up and moved back his\\r\\nchair, he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Raskolnikov had seen\\r\\nhim, and was watching him. What had passed between them was much the\\r\\nsame as what happened at their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room. A\\r\\nsly smile came into Svidrigaïlov’s face and grew broader and\\r\\nbroader. Each knew that he was seen and watched by the other. At last\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov broke into a loud laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, well, come in if you want me; I am here!” he shouted from the\\r\\nwindow.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov went up into the tavern. He found Svidrigaïlov in a tiny\\r\\nback room, adjoining the saloon in which merchants, clerks and numbers\\r\\nof people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the\\r\\ndesperate bawling of a chorus of singers. The click of billiard balls\\r\\ncould be heard in the distance. On the table before Svidrigaïlov stood\\r\\nan open bottle and a glass half full of champagne. In the room he found\\r\\nalso a boy with a little hand organ, a healthy-looking red-cheeked girl\\r\\nof eighteen, wearing a tucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat with\\r\\nribbons. In spite of the chorus in the other room, she was singing some\\r\\nservants’ hall song in a rather husky contralto, to the accompaniment of\\r\\nthe organ.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, that’s enough,” Svidrigaïlov stopped her at Raskolnikov’s\\r\\nentrance. The girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully.\\r\\nShe had sung her guttural rhymes, too, with a serious and respectful\\r\\nexpression in her face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hey, Philip, a glass!” shouted Svidrigaïlov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I won’t drink anything,” said Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“As you like, I didn’t mean it for you. Drink, Katia! I don’t want\\r\\nanything more to-day, you can go.” He poured her out a full glass, and\\r\\nlaid down a yellow note.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatia drank off her glass of wine, as women do, without putting it down,\\r\\nin twenty gulps, took the note and kissed Svidrigaïlov’s hand, which he\\r\\nallowed quite seriously. She went out of the room and the boy trailed\\r\\nafter her with the organ. Both had been brought in from the street.\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov had not been a week in Petersburg, but everything about him\\r\\nwas already, so to speak, on a patriarchal footing; the waiter, Philip,\\r\\nwas by now an old friend and very obsequious.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door leading to the saloon had a lock on it. Svidrigaïlov was at\\r\\nhome in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it. The tavern was\\r\\ndirty and wretched, not even second-rate.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was going to see you and looking for you,” Raskolnikov began, “but\\r\\nI don’t know what made me turn from the Hay Market into the X. Prospect\\r\\njust now. I never take this turning. I turn to the right from the Hay\\r\\nMarket. And this isn’t the way to you. I simply turned and here you are.\\r\\nIt is strange!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why don’t you say at once ‘it’s a miracle’?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because it may be only chance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, that’s the way with all you folk,” laughed Svidrigaïlov. “You won’t\\r\\nadmit it, even if you do inwardly believe it a miracle! Here you say\\r\\nthat it may be only chance. And what cowards they all are here, about\\r\\nhaving an opinion of their own, you can’t fancy, Rodion Romanovitch. I\\r\\ndon’t mean you, you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to\\r\\nhave it. That’s how it was you attracted my curiosity.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing else?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, that’s enough, you know,” Svidrigaïlov was obviously exhilarated,\\r\\nbut only slightly so, he had not had more than half a glass of wine.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I fancy you came to see me before you knew that I was capable of having\\r\\nwhat you call an opinion of my own,” observed Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, well, it was a different matter. Everyone has his own plans. And\\r\\napropos of the miracle let me tell you that I think you have been asleep\\r\\nfor the last two or three days. I told you of this tavern myself, there\\r\\nis no miracle in your coming straight here. I explained the way myself,\\r\\ntold you where it was, and the hours you could find me here. Do you\\r\\nremember?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t remember,” answered Raskolnikov with surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I believe you. I told you twice. The address has been stamped\\r\\nmechanically on your memory. You turned this way mechanically and yet\\r\\nprecisely according to the direction, though you are not aware of\\r\\nit. When I told you then, I hardly hoped you understood me. You give\\r\\nyourself away too much, Rodion Romanovitch. And another thing, I’m\\r\\nconvinced there are lots of people in Petersburg who talk to themselves\\r\\nas they walk. This is a town of crazy people. If only we had scientific\\r\\nmen, doctors, lawyers and philosophers might make most valuable\\r\\ninvestigations in Petersburg each in his own line. There are few places\\r\\nwhere there are so many gloomy, strong and queer influences on the soul\\r\\nof man as in Petersburg. The mere influences of climate mean so much.\\r\\nAnd it’s the administrative centre of all Russia and its character must\\r\\nbe reflected on the whole country. But that is neither here nor there\\r\\nnow. The point is that I have several times watched you. You walk out\\r\\nof your house--holding your head high--twenty paces from home you let it\\r\\nsink, and fold your hands behind your back. You look and evidently see\\r\\nnothing before nor beside you. At last you begin moving your lips and\\r\\ntalking to yourself, and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and at\\r\\nlast stand still in the middle of the road. That’s not at all the thing.\\r\\nSomeone may be watching you besides me, and it won’t do you any good.\\r\\nIt’s nothing really to do with me and I can’t cure you, but, of course,\\r\\nyou understand me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know that I am being followed?” asked Raskolnikov, looking\\r\\ninquisitively at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I know nothing about it,” said Svidrigaïlov, seeming surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, then, let us leave me alone,” Raskolnikov muttered, frowning.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good, let us leave you alone.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You had better tell me, if you come here to drink, and directed me\\r\\ntwice to come here to you, why did you hide, and try to get away just\\r\\nnow when I looked at the window from the street? I saw it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He-he! And why was it you lay on your sofa with closed eyes and\\r\\npretended to be asleep, though you were wide awake while I stood in your\\r\\ndoorway? I saw it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I may have had... reasons. You know that yourself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And I may have had my reasons, though you don’t know them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table, leaned his chin in the\\r\\nfingers of his right hand, and stared intently at Svidrigaïlov. For a\\r\\nfull minute he scrutinised his face, which had impressed him before. It\\r\\nwas a strange face, like a mask; white and red, with bright red lips,\\r\\nwith a flaxen beard, and still thick flaxen hair. His eyes were somehow\\r\\ntoo blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed. There was\\r\\nsomething awfully unpleasant in that handsome face, which looked so\\r\\nwonderfully young for his age. Svidrigaïlov was smartly dressed in light\\r\\nsummer clothes and was particularly dainty in his linen. He wore a huge\\r\\nring with a precious stone in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have I got to bother myself about you, too, now?” said Raskolnikov\\r\\nsuddenly, coming with nervous impatience straight to the point. “Even\\r\\nthough perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to injure me,\\r\\nI don’t want to put myself out any more. I will show you at once that I\\r\\ndon’t prize myself as you probably think I do. I’ve come to tell you at\\r\\nonce that if you keep to your former intentions with regard to my sister\\r\\nand if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what has\\r\\nbeen discovered of late, I will kill you before you get me locked up.\\r\\nYou can reckon on my word. You know that I can keep it. And in the\\r\\nsecond place if you want to tell me anything--for I keep fancying all\\r\\nthis time that you have something to tell me--make haste and tell it,\\r\\nfor time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why in such haste?” asked Svidrigaïlov, looking at him curiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Everyone has his plans,” Raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You urged me yourself to frankness just now, and at the first question\\r\\nyou refuse to answer,” Svidrigaïlov observed with a smile. “You\\r\\nkeep fancying that I have aims of my own and so you look at me with\\r\\nsuspicion. Of course it’s perfectly natural in your position. But\\r\\nthough I should like to be friends with you, I shan’t trouble myself\\r\\nto convince you of the contrary. The game isn’t worth the candle and I\\r\\nwasn’t intending to talk to you about anything special.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did you want me, for, then? It was you who came hanging about me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, simply as an interesting subject for observation. I liked the\\r\\nfantastic nature of your position--that’s what it was! Besides you are\\r\\nthe brother of a person who greatly interested me, and from that person\\r\\nI had in the past heard a very great deal about you, from which I\\r\\ngathered that you had a great influence over her; isn’t that enough?\\r\\nHa-ha-ha! Still I must admit that your question is rather complex, and\\r\\nis difficult for me to answer. Here, you, for instance, have come to me\\r\\nnot only for a definite object, but for the sake of hearing something\\r\\nnew. Isn’t that so? Isn’t that so?” persisted Svidrigaïlov with a sly\\r\\nsmile. “Well, can’t you fancy then that I, too, on my way here in the\\r\\ntrain was reckoning on you, on your telling me something new, and on my\\r\\nmaking some profit out of you! You see what rich men we are!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What profit could you make?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How can I tell you? How do I know? You see in what a tavern I spend all\\r\\nmy time and it’s my enjoyment, that’s to say it’s no great enjoyment,\\r\\nbut one must sit somewhere; that poor Katia now--you saw her?... If only\\r\\nI had been a glutton now, a club gourmand, but you see I can eat this.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pointed to a little table in the corner where the remnants of a\\r\\nterrible-looking beef-steak and potatoes lay on a tin dish.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you dined, by the way? I’ve had something and want nothing more.\\r\\nI don’t drink, for instance, at all. Except for champagne I never touch\\r\\nanything, and not more than a glass of that all the evening, and even\\r\\nthat is enough to make my head ache. I ordered it just now to wind\\r\\nmyself up, for I am just going off somewhere and you see me in a\\r\\npeculiar state of mind. That was why I hid myself just now like a\\r\\nschoolboy, for I was afraid you would hinder me. But I believe,” he\\r\\npulled out his watch, “I can spend an hour with you. It’s half-past\\r\\nfour now. If only I’d been something, a landowner, a father, a cavalry\\r\\nofficer, a photographer, a journalist... I am nothing, no specialty,\\r\\nand sometimes I am positively bored. I really thought you would tell me\\r\\nsomething new.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what are you, and why have you come here?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What am I? You know, a gentleman, I served for two years in the\\r\\ncavalry, then I knocked about here in Petersburg, then I married Marfa\\r\\nPetrovna and lived in the country. There you have my biography!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a gambler, I believe?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, a poor sort of gambler. A card-sharper--not a gambler.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have been a card-sharper then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I’ve been a card-sharper too.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Didn’t you get thrashed sometimes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It did happen. Why?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, you might have challenged them... altogether it must have been\\r\\nlively.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I won’t contradict you, and besides I am no hand at philosophy. I\\r\\nconfess that I hastened here for the sake of the women.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As soon as you buried Marfa Petrovna?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so,” Svidrigaïlov smiled with engaging candour. “What of it? You\\r\\nseem to find something wrong in my speaking like that about women?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Vice! Oh, that’s what you are after! But I’ll answer you in order,\\r\\nfirst about women in general; you know I am fond of talking. Tell me,\\r\\nwhat should I restrain myself for? Why should I give up women, since I\\r\\nhave a passion for them? It’s an occupation, anyway.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So you hope for nothing here but vice?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, very well, for vice then. You insist on its being vice. But anyway\\r\\nI like a direct question. In this vice at least there is something\\r\\npermanent, founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy,\\r\\nsomething present in the blood like an ever-burning ember, for ever\\r\\nsetting one on fire and, maybe, not to be quickly extinguished, even\\r\\nwith years. You’ll agree it’s an occupation of a sort.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s nothing to rejoice at, it’s a disease and a dangerous one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, that’s what you think, is it! I agree, that it is a disease like\\r\\neverything that exceeds moderation. And, of course, in this one must\\r\\nexceed moderation. But in the first place, everybody does so in one way\\r\\nor another, and in the second place, of course, one ought to be moderate\\r\\nand prudent, however mean it may be, but what am I to do? If I hadn’t\\r\\nthis, I might have to shoot myself. I am ready to admit that a decent\\r\\nman ought to put up with being bored, but yet...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And could you shoot yourself?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, come!” Svidrigaïlov parried with disgust. “Please don’t speak of\\r\\nit,” he added hurriedly and with none of the bragging tone he had shown\\r\\nin all the previous conversation. His face quite changed. “I admit it’s\\r\\nan unpardonable weakness, but I can’t help it. I am afraid of death and\\r\\nI dislike its being talked of. Do you know that I am to a certain extent\\r\\na mystic?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, the apparitions of Marfa Petrovna! Do they still go on visiting\\r\\nyou?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, don’t talk of them; there have been no more in Petersburg, confound\\r\\nthem!” he cried with an air of irritation. “Let’s rather talk of that...\\r\\nthough... H’m! I have not much time, and can’t stay long with you,\\r\\nit’s a pity! I should have found plenty to tell you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s your engagement, a woman?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, a woman, a casual incident.... No, that’s not what I want to talk\\r\\nof.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the hideousness, the filthiness of all your surroundings, doesn’t\\r\\nthat affect you? Have you lost the strength to stop yourself?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And do you pretend to strength, too? He-he-he! You surprised me just\\r\\nnow, Rodion Romanovitch, though I knew beforehand it would be so.\\r\\nYou preach to me about vice and æsthetics! You--a Schiller, you--an\\r\\nidealist! Of course that’s all as it should be and it would be\\r\\nsurprising if it were not so, yet it is strange in reality.... Ah,\\r\\nwhat a pity I have no time, for you’re a most interesting type! And,\\r\\nby-the-way, are you fond of Schiller? I am awfully fond of him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what a braggart you are,” Raskolnikov said with some disgust.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Upon my word, I am not,” answered Svidrigaïlov laughing. “However, I\\r\\nwon’t dispute it, let me be a braggart, why not brag, if it hurts no\\r\\none? I spent seven years in the country with Marfa Petrovna, so now when\\r\\nI come across an intelligent person like you--intelligent and highly\\r\\ninteresting--I am simply glad to talk and, besides, I’ve drunk that\\r\\nhalf-glass of champagne and it’s gone to my head a little. And besides,\\r\\nthere’s a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously, but about that\\r\\nI... will keep quiet. Where are you off to?” he asked in alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov had begun getting up. He felt oppressed and stifled and,\\r\\nas it were, ill at ease at having come here. He felt convinced that\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A-ach! Sit down, stay a little!” Svidrigaïlov begged. “Let them bring\\r\\nyou some tea, anyway. Stay a little, I won’t talk nonsense, about\\r\\nmyself, I mean. I’ll tell you something. If you like I’ll tell you how a\\r\\nwoman tried ‘to save’ me, as you would call it? It will be an answer to\\r\\nyour first question indeed, for the woman was your sister. May I tell\\r\\nyou? It will help to spend the time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell me, but I trust that you...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, don’t be uneasy. Besides, even in a worthless low fellow like me,\\r\\nAvdotya Romanovna can only excite the deepest respect.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\n“You know perhaps--yes, I told you myself,” began Svidrigaïlov, “that\\r\\nI was in the debtors’ prison here, for an immense sum, and had not\\r\\nany expectation of being able to pay it. There’s no need to go into\\r\\nparticulars how Marfa Petrovna bought me out; do you know to what a\\r\\npoint of insanity a woman can sometimes love? She was an honest woman,\\r\\nand very sensible, although completely uneducated. Would you believe\\r\\nthat this honest and jealous woman, after many scenes of hysterics and\\r\\nreproaches, condescended to enter into a kind of contract with me which\\r\\nshe kept throughout our married life? She was considerably older than\\r\\nI, and besides, she always kept a clove or something in her mouth. There\\r\\nwas so much swinishness in my soul and honesty too, of a sort, as to\\r\\ntell her straight out that I couldn’t be absolutely faithful to her.\\r\\nThis confession drove her to frenzy, but yet she seems in a way to have\\r\\nliked my brutal frankness. She thought it showed I was unwilling to\\r\\ndeceive her if I warned her like this beforehand and for a jealous\\r\\nwoman, you know, that’s the first consideration. After many tears an\\r\\nunwritten contract was drawn up between us: first, that I would never\\r\\nleave Marfa Petrovna and would always be her husband; secondly, that I\\r\\nwould never absent myself without her permission; thirdly, that I would\\r\\nnever set up a permanent mistress; fourthly, in return for this, Marfa\\r\\nPetrovna gave me a free hand with the maidservants, but only with her\\r\\nsecret knowledge; fifthly, God forbid my falling in love with a woman of\\r\\nour class; sixthly, in case I--which God forbid--should be visited by\\r\\na great serious passion I was bound to reveal it to Marfa Petrovna. On\\r\\nthis last score, however, Marfa Petrovna was fairly at ease. She was a\\r\\nsensible woman and so she could not help looking upon me as a dissolute\\r\\nprofligate incapable of real love. But a sensible woman and a jealous\\r\\nwoman are two very different things, and that’s where the trouble\\r\\ncame in. But to judge some people impartially we must renounce certain\\r\\npreconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to the ordinary people\\r\\nabout us. I have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than\\r\\nin anyone’s. Perhaps you have already heard a great deal that was\\r\\nridiculous and absurd about Marfa Petrovna. She certainly had some very\\r\\nridiculous ways, but I tell you frankly that I feel really sorry for the\\r\\ninnumerable woes of which I was the cause. Well, and that’s enough, I\\r\\nthink, by way of a decorous _oraison funèbre_ for the most tender wife\\r\\nof a most tender husband. When we quarrelled, I usually held my tongue\\r\\nand did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to\\r\\nattain its object, it influenced her, it pleased her, indeed. These were\\r\\ntimes when she was positively proud of me. But your sister she couldn’t\\r\\nput up with, anyway. And however she came to risk taking such a\\r\\nbeautiful creature into her house as a governess. My explanation is that\\r\\nMarfa Petrovna was an ardent and impressionable woman and simply fell\\r\\nin love herself--literally fell in love--with your sister. Well, little\\r\\nwonder--look at Avdotya Romanovna! I saw the danger at the first glance\\r\\nand what do you think, I resolved not to look at her even. But Avdotya\\r\\nRomanovna herself made the first step, would you believe it? Would you\\r\\nbelieve it too that Marfa Petrovna was positively angry with me at first\\r\\nfor my persistent silence about your sister, for my careless reception\\r\\nof her continual adoring praises of Avdotya Romanovna. I don’t know\\r\\nwhat it was she wanted! Well, of course, Marfa Petrovna told Avdotya\\r\\nRomanovna every detail about me. She had the unfortunate habit of\\r\\ntelling literally everyone all our family secrets and continually\\r\\ncomplaining of me; how could she fail to confide in such a delightful\\r\\nnew friend? I expect they talked of nothing else but me and no doubt\\r\\nAvdotya Romanovna heard all those dark mysterious rumours that were\\r\\ncurrent about me.... I don’t mind betting that you too have heard\\r\\nsomething of the sort already?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have. Luzhin charged you with having caused the death of a child. Is\\r\\nthat true?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t refer to those vulgar tales, I beg,” said Svidrigaïlov with\\r\\ndisgust and annoyance. “If you insist on wanting to know about all that\\r\\nidiocy, I will tell you one day, but now...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was told too about some footman of yours in the country whom you\\r\\ntreated badly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I beg you to drop the subject,” Svidrigaïlov interrupted again with\\r\\nobvious impatience.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe?...\\r\\nyou told me about it yourself.” Raskolnikov felt more and more\\r\\nirritated.\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov looked at him attentively and Raskolnikov fancied he caught\\r\\na flash of spiteful mockery in that look. But Svidrigaïlov restrained\\r\\nhimself and answered very civilly:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it was. I see that you, too, are extremely interested and shall\\r\\nfeel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity. Upon\\r\\nmy soul! I see that I really might pass for a romantic figure with\\r\\nsome people. Judge how grateful I must be to Marfa Petrovna for having\\r\\nrepeated to Avdotya Romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip\\r\\nabout me. I dare not guess what impression it made on her, but in any\\r\\ncase it worked in my interests. With all Avdotya Romanovna’s natural\\r\\naversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and repellent aspect--she\\r\\ndid at least feel pity for me, pity for a lost soul. And if once a\\r\\ngirl’s heart is moved to _pity_, it’s more dangerous than anything. She\\r\\nis bound to want to ‘save him,’ to bring him to his senses, and lift\\r\\nhim up and draw him to nobler aims, and restore him to new life and\\r\\nusefulness--well, we all know how far such dreams can go. I saw at once\\r\\nthat the bird was flying into the cage of herself. And I too made ready.\\r\\nI think you are frowning, Rodion Romanovitch? There’s no need. As you\\r\\nknow, it all ended in smoke. (Hang it all, what a lot I am drinking!)\\r\\nDo you know, I always, from the very beginning, regretted that it wasn’t\\r\\nyour sister’s fate to be born in the second or third century A.D., as\\r\\nthe daughter of a reigning prince or some governor or pro-consul in Asia\\r\\nMinor. She would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure\\r\\nmartyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot\\r\\npincers. And she would have gone to it of herself. And in the fourth or\\r\\nfifth century she would have walked away into the Egyptian desert and\\r\\nwould have stayed there thirty years living on roots and ecstasies and\\r\\nvisions. She is simply thirsting to face some torture for someone, and\\r\\nif she can’t get her torture, she’ll throw herself out of a window. I’ve\\r\\nheard something of a Mr. Razumihin--he’s said to be a sensible fellow;\\r\\nhis surname suggests it, indeed. He’s probably a divinity student. Well,\\r\\nhe’d better look after your sister! I believe I understand her, and I am\\r\\nproud of it. But at the beginning of an acquaintance, as you know, one\\r\\nis apt to be more heedless and stupid. One doesn’t see clearly. Hang it\\r\\nall, why is she so handsome? It’s not my fault. In fact, it began on\\r\\nmy side with a most irresistible physical desire. Avdotya Romanovna is\\r\\nawfully chaste, incredibly and phenomenally so. Take note, I tell you\\r\\nthis about your sister as a fact. She is almost morbidly chaste, in\\r\\nspite of her broad intelligence, and it will stand in her way. There\\r\\nhappened to be a girl in the house then, Parasha, a black-eyed\\r\\nwench, whom I had never seen before--she had just come from another\\r\\nvillage--very pretty, but incredibly stupid: she burst into tears,\\r\\nwailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal.\\r\\nOne day after dinner Avdotya Romanovna followed me into an avenue in\\r\\nthe garden and with flashing eyes _insisted_ on my leaving poor Parasha\\r\\nalone. It was almost our first conversation by ourselves. I, of course,\\r\\nwas only too pleased to obey her wishes, tried to appear disconcerted,\\r\\nembarrassed, in fact played my part not badly. Then came interviews,\\r\\nmysterious conversations, exhortations, entreaties, supplications, even\\r\\ntears--would you believe it, even tears? Think what the passion for\\r\\npropaganda will bring some girls to! I, of course, threw it all on\\r\\nmy destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and finally\\r\\nresorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the\\r\\nfemale heart, a weapon which never fails one. It’s the well-known\\r\\nresource--flattery. Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the\\r\\ntruth and nothing easier than flattery. If there’s the hundredth part\\r\\nof a false note in speaking the truth, it leads to a discord, and that\\r\\nleads to trouble. But if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it\\r\\nis just as agreeable, and is heard not without satisfaction. It may be\\r\\na coarse satisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And however coarse the\\r\\nflattery, at least half will be sure to seem true. That’s so for all\\r\\nstages of development and classes of society. A vestal virgin might be\\r\\nseduced by flattery. I can never remember without laughter how I once\\r\\nseduced a lady who was devoted to her husband, her children, and her\\r\\nprinciples. What fun it was and how little trouble! And the lady really\\r\\nhad principles--of her own, anyway. All my tactics lay in simply being\\r\\nutterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity. I flattered her\\r\\nshamelessly, and as soon as I succeeded in getting a pressure of\\r\\nthe hand, even a glance from her, I would reproach myself for having\\r\\nsnatched it by force, and would declare that she had resisted, so that\\r\\nI could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled.\\r\\nI maintained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee my\\r\\ntreachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, unawares, and so on. In\\r\\nfact, I triumphed, while my lady remained firmly convinced that she was\\r\\ninnocent, chaste, and faithful to all her duties and obligations and\\r\\nhad succumbed quite by accident. And how angry she was with me when I\\r\\nexplained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was\\r\\njust as eager as I. Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully weak on the side of\\r\\nflattery, and if I had only cared to, I might have had all her property\\r\\nsettled on me during her lifetime. (I am drinking an awful lot of wine\\r\\nnow and talking too much.) I hope you won’t be angry if I mention now\\r\\nthat I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya Romanovna.\\r\\nBut I was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all. Avdotya Romanovna had\\r\\nseveral times--and one time in particular--been greatly displeased by\\r\\nthe expression of my eyes, would you believe it? There was sometimes a\\r\\nlight in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and\\r\\nmore unguarded till it was hateful to her. No need to go into detail,\\r\\nbut we parted. There I acted stupidly again. I fell to jeering in the\\r\\ncoarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me; Parasha\\r\\ncame on to the scene again, and not she alone; in fact there was a\\r\\ntremendous to-do. Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how your\\r\\nsister’s eyes can flash sometimes! Never mind my being drunk at this\\r\\nmoment and having had a whole glass of wine. I am speaking the truth.\\r\\nI assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams; the very rustle of\\r\\nher dress was more than I could stand at last. I really began to think\\r\\nthat I might become epileptic. I could never have believed that I could\\r\\nbe moved to such a frenzy. It was essential, indeed, to be reconciled,\\r\\nbut by then it was impossible. And imagine what I did then! To what\\r\\na pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy! Never undertake\\r\\nanything in a frenzy, Rodion Romanovitch. I reflected that Avdotya\\r\\nRomanovna was after all a beggar (ach, excuse me, that’s not the word...\\r\\nbut does it matter if it expresses the meaning?), that she lived by\\r\\nher work, that she had her mother and you to keep (ach, hang it, you\\r\\nare frowning again), and I resolved to offer her all my money--thirty\\r\\nthousand roubles I could have realised then--if she would run away with\\r\\nme here, to Petersburg. Of course I should have vowed eternal love,\\r\\nrapture, and so on. Do you know, I was so wild about her at that time\\r\\nthat if she had told me to poison Marfa Petrovna or to cut her throat\\r\\nand to marry herself, it would have been done at once! But it ended in\\r\\nthe catastrophe of which you know already. You can fancy how frantic I\\r\\nwas when I heard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly\\r\\nattorney, Luzhin, and had almost made a match between them--which would\\r\\nreally have been just the same thing as I was proposing. Wouldn’t it?\\r\\nWouldn’t it? I notice that you’ve begun to be very attentive... you\\r\\ninteresting young man....”\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov struck the table with his fist impatiently. He was flushed.\\r\\nRaskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or glass and a half of champagne\\r\\nthat he had sipped almost unconsciously was affecting him--and he\\r\\nresolved to take advantage of the opportunity. He felt very suspicious\\r\\nof Svidrigaïlov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, after what you have said, I am fully convinced that you have\\r\\ncome to Petersburg with designs on my sister,” he said directly to\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov, in order to irritate him further.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, nonsense,” said Svidrigaïlov, seeming to rouse himself. “Why, I\\r\\ntold you... besides your sister can’t endure me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I am certain that she can’t, but that’s not the point.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you so sure that she can’t?” Svidrigaïlov screwed up his eyes and\\r\\nsmiled mockingly. “You are right, she doesn’t love me, but you can\\r\\nnever be sure of what has passed between husband and wife or lover and\\r\\nmistress. There’s always a little corner which remains a secret to\\r\\nthe world and is only known to those two. Will you answer for it that\\r\\nAvdotya Romanovna regarded me with aversion?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“From some words you’ve dropped, I notice that you still have\\r\\ndesigns--and of course evil ones--on Dounia and mean to carry them out\\r\\npromptly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What, have I dropped words like that?” Svidrigaïlov asked in naïve\\r\\ndismay, taking not the slightest notice of the epithet bestowed on his\\r\\ndesigns.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, you are dropping them even now. Why are you so frightened? What\\r\\nare you so afraid of now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Me--afraid? Afraid of you? You have rather to be afraid of me, _cher\\r\\nami_. But what nonsense.... I’ve drunk too much though, I see that. I\\r\\nwas almost saying too much again. Damn the wine! Hi! there, water!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe snatched up the champagne bottle and flung it without ceremony out of\\r\\nthe window. Philip brought the water.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s all nonsense!” said Svidrigaïlov, wetting a towel and putting it\\r\\nto his head. “But I can answer you in one word and annihilate all your\\r\\nsuspicions. Do you know that I am going to get married?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You told me so before.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did I? I’ve forgotten. But I couldn’t have told you so for certain for\\r\\nI had not even seen my betrothed; I only meant to. But now I really\\r\\nhave a betrothed and it’s a settled thing, and if it weren’t that I have\\r\\nbusiness that can’t be put off, I would have taken you to see them\\r\\nat once, for I should like to ask your advice. Ach, hang it, only ten\\r\\nminutes left! See, look at the watch. But I must tell you, for it’s an\\r\\ninteresting story, my marriage, in its own way. Where are you off to?\\r\\nGoing again?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I’m not going away now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at all? We shall see. I’ll take you there, I’ll show you my\\r\\nbetrothed, only not now. For you’ll soon have to be off. You have to go\\r\\nto the right and I to the left. Do you know that Madame Resslich, the\\r\\nwoman I am lodging with now, eh? I know what you’re thinking, that she’s\\r\\nthe woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter. Come, are\\r\\nyou listening? She arranged it all for me. You’re bored, she said,\\r\\nyou want something to fill up your time. For, you know, I am a gloomy,\\r\\ndepressed person. Do you think I’m light-hearted? No, I’m gloomy. I do\\r\\nno harm, but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at a\\r\\ntime. And that Resslich is a sly hussy, I tell you. I know what she has\\r\\ngot in her mind; she thinks I shall get sick of it, abandon my wife and\\r\\ndepart, and she’ll get hold of her and make a profit out of her--in our\\r\\nclass, of course, or higher. She told me the father was a broken-down\\r\\nretired official, who has been sitting in a chair for the last three\\r\\nyears with his legs paralysed. The mamma, she said, was a sensible\\r\\nwoman. There is a son serving in the provinces, but he doesn’t help;\\r\\nthere is a daughter, who is married, but she doesn’t visit them. And\\r\\nthey’ve two little nephews on their hands, as though their own children\\r\\nwere not enough, and they’ve taken from school their youngest daughter,\\r\\na girl who’ll be sixteen in another month, so that then she can be\\r\\nmarried. She was for me. We went there. How funny it was! I present\\r\\nmyself--a landowner, a widower, of a well-known name, with connections,\\r\\nwith a fortune. What if I am fifty and she is not sixteen? Who thinks\\r\\nof that? But it’s fascinating, isn’t it? It is fascinating, ha-ha! You\\r\\nshould have seen how I talked to the papa and mamma. It was worth paying\\r\\nto have seen me at that moment. She comes in, curtseys, you can fancy,\\r\\nstill in a short frock--an unopened bud! Flushing like a sunset--she had\\r\\nbeen told, no doubt. I don’t know how you feel about female faces, but\\r\\nto my mind these sixteen years, these childish eyes, shyness and tears\\r\\nof bashfulness are better than beauty; and she is a perfect little\\r\\npicture, too. Fair hair in little curls, like a lamb’s, full little rosy\\r\\nlips, tiny feet, a charmer!... Well, we made friends. I told them I was\\r\\nin a hurry owing to domestic circumstances, and the next day, that is\\r\\nthe day before yesterday, we were betrothed. When I go now I take her on\\r\\nmy knee at once and keep her there.... Well, she flushes like a sunset\\r\\nand I kiss her every minute. Her mamma of course impresses on her that\\r\\nthis is her husband and that this must be so. It’s simply delicious! The\\r\\npresent betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage. Here you\\r\\nhave what is called _la nature et la vérité_, ha-ha! I’ve talked to her\\r\\ntwice, she is far from a fool. Sometimes she steals a look at me that\\r\\npositively scorches me. Her face is like Raphael’s Madonna. You know,\\r\\nthe Sistine Madonna’s face has something fantastic in it, the face\\r\\nof mournful religious ecstasy. Haven’t you noticed it? Well, she’s\\r\\nsomething in that line. The day after we’d been betrothed, I bought her\\r\\npresents to the value of fifteen hundred roubles--a set of diamonds and\\r\\nanother of pearls and a silver dressing-case as large as this, with all\\r\\nsorts of things in it, so that even my Madonna’s face glowed. I sat her\\r\\non my knee, yesterday, and I suppose rather too unceremoniously--she\\r\\nflushed crimson and the tears started, but she didn’t want to show it.\\r\\nWe were left alone, she suddenly flung herself on my neck (for the first\\r\\ntime of her own accord), put her little arms round me, kissed me, and\\r\\nvowed that she would be an obedient, faithful, and good wife, would make\\r\\nme happy, would devote all her life, every minute of her life, would\\r\\nsacrifice everything, everything, and that all she asks in return is\\r\\nmy _respect_, and that she wants ‘nothing, nothing more from me, no\\r\\npresents.’ You’ll admit that to hear such a confession, alone, from an\\r\\nangel of sixteen in a muslin frock, with little curls, with a flush\\r\\nof maiden shyness in her cheeks and tears of enthusiasm in her eyes is\\r\\nrather fascinating! Isn’t it fascinating? It’s worth paying for, isn’t\\r\\nit? Well... listen, we’ll go to see my betrothed, only not just now!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The fact is this monstrous difference in age and development excites\\r\\nyour sensuality! Will you really make such a marriage?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, of course. Everyone thinks of himself, and he lives most gaily who\\r\\nknows best how to deceive himself. Ha-ha! But why are you so keen about\\r\\nvirtue? Have mercy on me, my good friend. I am a sinful man. Ha-ha-ha!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you have provided for the children of Katerina Ivanovna. Though...\\r\\nthough you had your own reasons.... I understand it all now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am always fond of children, very fond of them,” laughed Svidrigaïlov.\\r\\n“I can tell you one curious instance of it. The first day I came here I\\r\\nvisited various haunts, after seven years I simply rushed at them. You\\r\\nprobably notice that I am not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with my\\r\\nold friends. I shall do without them as long as I can. Do you know, when\\r\\nI was with Marfa Petrovna in the country, I was haunted by the thought\\r\\nof these places where anyone who knows his way about can find a great\\r\\ndeal. Yes, upon my soul! The peasants have vodka, the educated young\\r\\npeople, shut out from activity, waste themselves in impossible dreams\\r\\nand visions and are crippled by theories; Jews have sprung up and are\\r\\namassing money, and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery. From\\r\\nthe first hour the town reeked of its familiar odours. I chanced to be\\r\\nin a frightful den--I like my dens dirty--it was a dance, so called, and\\r\\nthere was a _cancan_ such as I never saw in my day. Yes, there you\\r\\nhave progress. All of a sudden I saw a little girl of thirteen, nicely\\r\\ndressed, dancing with a specialist in that line, with another one\\r\\n_vis-à-vis_. Her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall. You can’t\\r\\nfancy what a _cancan_ that was! The girl was ashamed, blushed, at\\r\\nlast felt insulted, and began to cry. Her partner seized her and began\\r\\nwhirling her round and performing before her; everyone laughed and--I\\r\\nlike your public, even the _cancan_ public--they laughed and shouted,\\r\\n‘Serves her right--serves her right! Shouldn’t bring children!’ Well,\\r\\nit’s not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical or\\r\\nnot. I at once fixed on my plan, sat down by the mother, and began by\\r\\nsaying that I too was a stranger and that people here were ill-bred and\\r\\nthat they couldn’t distinguish decent folks and treat them with respect,\\r\\ngave her to understand that I had plenty of money, offered to take them\\r\\nhome in my carriage. I took them home and got to know them. They were\\r\\nlodging in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from the\\r\\ncountry. She told me that she and her daughter could only regard my\\r\\nacquaintance as an honour. I found out that they had nothing of their\\r\\nown and had come to town upon some legal business. I proffered my\\r\\nservices and money. I learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon\\r\\nby mistake, believing that it was a genuine dancing class. I offered to\\r\\nassist in the young girl’s education in French and dancing. My offer was\\r\\naccepted with enthusiasm as an honour--and we are still friendly.... If\\r\\nyou like, we’ll go and see them, only not just now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stop! Enough of your vile, nasty anecdotes, depraved vile, sensual\\r\\nman!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Schiller, you are a regular Schiller! _O la vertu va-t-elle se nicher?_\\r\\nBut you know I shall tell you these things on purpose, for the pleasure\\r\\nof hearing your outcries!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I dare say. I can see I am ridiculous myself,” muttered Raskolnikov\\r\\nangrily.\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov laughed heartily; finally he called Philip, paid his bill,\\r\\nand began getting up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say, but I am drunk, _assez causé_,” he said. “It’s been a pleasure.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should rather think it must be a pleasure!” cried Raskolnikov,\\r\\ngetting up. “No doubt it is a pleasure for a worn-out profligate to\\r\\ndescribe such adventures with a monstrous project of the same sort in\\r\\nhis mind--especially under such circumstances and to such a man as\\r\\nme.... It’s stimulating!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, if you come to that,” Svidrigaïlov answered, scrutinising\\r\\nRaskolnikov with some surprise, “if you come to that, you are a thorough\\r\\ncynic yourself. You’ve plenty to make you so, anyway. You can understand\\r\\na great deal... and you can do a great deal too. But enough. I sincerely\\r\\nregret not having had more talk with you, but I shan’t lose sight of\\r\\nyou.... Only wait a bit.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov walked out of the restaurant. Raskolnikov walked out after\\r\\nhim. Svidrigaïlov was not however very drunk, the wine had affected him\\r\\nfor a moment, but it was passing off every minute. He was preoccupied\\r\\nwith something of importance and was frowning. He was apparently excited\\r\\nand uneasy in anticipation of something. His manner to Raskolnikov had\\r\\nchanged during the last few minutes, and he was ruder and more sneering\\r\\nevery moment. Raskolnikov noticed all this, and he too was uneasy. He\\r\\nbecame very suspicious of Svidrigaïlov and resolved to follow him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came out on to the pavement.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You go to the right, and I to the left, or if you like, the other way.\\r\\nOnly _adieu, mon plaisir_, may we meet again.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he walked to the right towards the Hay Market.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov walked after him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s this?” cried Svidrigaïlov turning round, “I thought I said...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It means that I am not going to lose sight of you now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth stood still and gazed at one another, as though measuring their\\r\\nstrength.\\r\\n\\r\\n“From all your half tipsy stories,” Raskolnikov observed harshly, “I am\\r\\n_positive_ that you have not given up your designs on my sister, but\\r\\nare pursuing them more actively than ever. I have learnt that my sister\\r\\nreceived a letter this morning. You have hardly been able to sit still\\r\\nall this time.... You may have unearthed a wife on the way, but that\\r\\nmeans nothing. I should like to make certain myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he wanted and of what he\\r\\nwished to make certain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Upon my word! I’ll call the police!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Call away!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain they stood for a minute facing each other. At last Svidrigaïlov’s\\r\\nface changed. Having satisfied himself that Raskolnikov was not\\r\\nfrightened at his threat, he assumed a mirthful and friendly air.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a fellow! I purposely refrained from referring to your affair,\\r\\nthough I am devoured by curiosity. It’s a fantastic affair. I’ve put it\\r\\noff till another time, but you’re enough to rouse the dead.... Well, let\\r\\nus go, only I warn you beforehand I am only going home for a moment,\\r\\nto get some money; then I shall lock up the flat, take a cab and go to\\r\\nspend the evening at the Islands. Now, now are you going to follow me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m coming to your lodgings, not to see you but Sofya Semyonovna, to\\r\\nsay I’m sorry not to have been at the funeral.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s as you like, but Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. She has taken\\r\\nthe three children to an old lady of high rank, the patroness of some\\r\\norphan asylums, whom I used to know years ago. I charmed the old lady by\\r\\ndepositing a sum of money with her to provide for the three children of\\r\\nKaterina Ivanovna and subscribing to the institution as well. I told her\\r\\ntoo the story of Sofya Semyonovna in full detail, suppressing nothing.\\r\\nIt produced an indescribable effect on her. That’s why Sofya Semyonovna\\r\\nhas been invited to call to-day at the X. Hotel where the lady is\\r\\nstaying for the time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No matter, I’ll come all the same.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As you like, it’s nothing to me, but I won’t come with you; here we are\\r\\nat home. By the way, I am convinced that you regard me with suspicion\\r\\njust because I have shown such delicacy and have not so far troubled\\r\\nyou with questions... you understand? It struck you as extraordinary; I\\r\\ndon’t mind betting it’s that. Well, it teaches one to show delicacy!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And to listen at doors!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, that’s it, is it?” laughed Svidrigaïlov. “Yes, I should have been\\r\\nsurprised if you had let that pass after all that has happened. Ha-ha!\\r\\nThough I did understand something of the pranks you had been up to and\\r\\nwere telling Sofya Semyonovna about, what was the meaning of it? Perhaps\\r\\nI am quite behind the times and can’t understand. For goodness’ sake,\\r\\nexplain it, my dear boy. Expound the latest theories!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You couldn’t have heard anything. You’re making it all up!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I’m not talking about that (though I did hear something). No, I’m\\r\\ntalking of the way you keep sighing and groaning now. The Schiller in\\r\\nyou is in revolt every moment, and now you tell me not to listen at\\r\\ndoors. If that’s how you feel, go and inform the police that you had\\r\\nthis mischance: you made a little mistake in your theory. But if you are\\r\\nconvinced that one mustn’t listen at doors, but one may murder old women\\r\\nat one’s pleasure, you’d better be off to America and make haste. Run,\\r\\nyoung man! There may still be time. I’m speaking sincerely. Haven’t you\\r\\nthe money? I’ll give you the fare.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not thinking of that at all,” Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I understand (but don’t put yourself out, don’t discuss it if you don’t\\r\\nwant to). I understand the questions you are worrying over--moral ones,\\r\\naren’t they? Duties of citizen and man? Lay them all aside. They are\\r\\nnothing to you now, ha-ha! You’ll say you are still a man and a citizen.\\r\\nIf so you ought not to have got into this coil. It’s no use taking up a\\r\\njob you are not fit for. Well, you’d better shoot yourself, or don’t you\\r\\nwant to?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You seem trying to enrage me, to make me leave you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a queer fellow! But here we are. Welcome to the staircase. You\\r\\nsee, that’s the way to Sofya Semyonovna. Look, there is no one at home.\\r\\nDon’t you believe me? Ask Kapernaumov. She leaves the key with him. Here\\r\\nis Madame de Kapernaumov herself. Hey, what? She is rather deaf. Has she\\r\\ngone out? Where? Did you hear? She is not in and won’t be till late in\\r\\nthe evening probably. Well, come to my room; you wanted to come and see\\r\\nme, didn’t you? Here we are. Madame Resslich’s not at home. She is a\\r\\nwoman who is always busy, an excellent woman I assure you.... She might\\r\\nhave been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible. Now,\\r\\nsee! I take this five-per-cent bond out of the bureau--see what a lot\\r\\nI’ve got of them still--this one will be turned into cash to-day. I\\r\\nmustn’t waste any more time. The bureau is locked, the flat is locked,\\r\\nand here we are again on the stairs. Shall we take a cab? I’m going to\\r\\nthe Islands. Would you like a lift? I’ll take this carriage. Ah, you\\r\\nrefuse? You are tired of it! Come for a drive! I believe it will come on\\r\\nto rain. Never mind, we’ll put down the hood....”\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov was already in the carriage. Raskolnikov decided that his\\r\\nsuspicions were at least for that moment unjust. Without answering a\\r\\nword he turned and walked back towards the Hay Market. If he had only\\r\\nturned round on his way he might have seen Svidrigaïlov get out not a\\r\\nhundred paces off, dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement. But he\\r\\nhad turned the corner and could see nothing. Intense disgust drew him\\r\\naway from Svidrigaïlov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To think that I could for one instant have looked for help from that\\r\\ncoarse brute, that depraved sensualist and blackguard!” he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov’s judgment was uttered too lightly and hastily: there was\\r\\nsomething about Svidrigaïlov which gave him a certain original, even a\\r\\nmysterious character. As concerned his sister, Raskolnikov was convinced\\r\\nthat Svidrigaïlov would not leave her in peace. But it was too tiresome\\r\\nand unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he was alone, he had not gone twenty paces before he sank, as\\r\\nusual, into deep thought. On the bridge he stood by the railing and\\r\\nbegan gazing at the water. And his sister was standing close by him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe met her at the entrance to the bridge, but passed by without seeing\\r\\nher. Dounia had never met him like this in the street before and was\\r\\nstruck with dismay. She stood still and did not know whether to call\\r\\nto him or not. Suddenly she saw Svidrigaïlov coming quickly from the\\r\\ndirection of the Hay Market.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed to be approaching cautiously. He did not go on to the\\r\\nbridge, but stood aside on the pavement, doing all he could to avoid\\r\\nRaskolnikov’s seeing him. He had observed Dounia for some time and had\\r\\nbeen making signs to her. She fancied he was signalling to beg her not\\r\\nto speak to her brother, but to come to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was what Dounia did. She stole by her brother and went up to\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let us make haste away,” Svidrigaïlov whispered to her, “I don’t want\\r\\nRodion Romanovitch to know of our meeting. I must tell you I’ve been\\r\\nsitting with him in the restaurant close by, where he looked me up and\\r\\nI had great difficulty in getting rid of him. He has somehow heard of\\r\\nmy letter to you and suspects something. It wasn’t you who told him, of\\r\\ncourse, but if not you, who then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, we’ve turned the corner now,” Dounia interrupted, “and my brother\\r\\nwon’t see us. I have to tell you that I am going no further with you.\\r\\nSpeak to me here. You can tell it all in the street.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the first place, I can’t say it in the street; secondly, you must\\r\\nhear Sofya Semyonovna too; and, thirdly, I will show you some papers....\\r\\nOh well, if you won’t agree to come with me, I shall refuse to give\\r\\nany explanation and go away at once. But I beg you not to forget that\\r\\na very curious secret of your beloved brother’s is entirely in my\\r\\nkeeping.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDounia stood still, hesitating, and looked at Svidrigaïlov with\\r\\nsearching eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you afraid of?” he observed quietly. “The town is not the\\r\\ncountry. And even in the country you did me more harm than I did you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you prepared Sofya Semyonovna?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I have not said a word to her and am not quite certain whether she\\r\\nis at home now. But most likely she is. She has buried her stepmother\\r\\nto-day: she is not likely to go visiting on such a day. For the time I\\r\\ndon’t want to speak to anyone about it and I half regret having spoken\\r\\nto you. The slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like\\r\\nthis. I live there in that house, we are coming to it. That’s the porter\\r\\nof our house--he knows me very well; you see, he’s bowing; he sees I’m\\r\\ncoming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and you\\r\\nwill be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious. Excuse\\r\\nmy putting things so coarsely. I haven’t a flat to myself; Sofya\\r\\nSemyonovna’s room is next to mine--she lodges in the next flat. The\\r\\nwhole floor is let out in lodgings. Why are you frightened like a child?\\r\\nAm I really so terrible?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov’s lips were twisted in a condescending smile; but he was in\\r\\nno smiling mood. His heart was throbbing and he could scarcely breathe.\\r\\nHe spoke rather loud to cover his growing excitement. But Dounia did not\\r\\nnotice this peculiar excitement, she was so irritated by his remark that\\r\\nshe was frightened of him like a child and that he was so terrible to\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Though I know that you are not a man... of honour, I am not in the\\r\\nleast afraid of you. Lead the way,” she said with apparent composure,\\r\\nbut her face was very pale.\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov stopped at Sonia’s room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Allow me to inquire whether she is at home.... She is not. How\\r\\nunfortunate! But I know she may come quite soon. If she’s gone out, it\\r\\ncan only be to see a lady about the orphans. Their mother is dead....\\r\\nI’ve been meddling and making arrangements for them. If Sofya Semyonovna\\r\\ndoes not come back in ten minutes, I will send her to you, to-day if\\r\\nyou like. This is my flat. These are my two rooms. Madame Resslich,\\r\\nmy landlady, has the next room. Now, look this way. I will show you\\r\\nmy chief piece of evidence: this door from my bedroom leads into two\\r\\nperfectly empty rooms, which are to let. Here they are... You must look\\r\\ninto them with some attention.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms. Dounia was\\r\\nlooking about her mistrustfully, but saw nothing special in the\\r\\nfurniture or position of the rooms. Yet there was something to observe,\\r\\nfor instance, that Svidrigaïlov’s flat was exactly between two sets of\\r\\nalmost uninhabited apartments. His rooms were not entered directly\\r\\nfrom the passage, but through the landlady’s two almost empty rooms.\\r\\nUnlocking a door leading out of his bedroom, Svidrigaïlov showed Dounia\\r\\nthe two empty rooms that were to let. Dounia stopped in the doorway, not\\r\\nknowing what she was called to look upon, but Svidrigaïlov hastened to\\r\\nexplain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look here, at this second large room. Notice that door, it’s locked.\\r\\nBy the door stands a chair, the only one in the two rooms. I brought it\\r\\nfrom my rooms so as to listen more conveniently. Just the other side of\\r\\nthe door is Sofya Semyonovna’s table; she sat there talking to Rodion\\r\\nRomanovitch. And I sat here listening on two successive evenings, for\\r\\ntwo hours each time--and of course I was able to learn something, what\\r\\ndo you think?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You listened?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I did. Now come back to my room; we can’t sit down here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe brought Avdotya Romanovna back into his sitting-room and offered her\\r\\na chair. He sat down at the opposite side of the table, at least seven\\r\\nfeet from her, but probably there was the same glow in his eyes which\\r\\nhad once frightened Dounia so much. She shuddered and once more looked\\r\\nabout her distrustfully. It was an involuntary gesture; she evidently\\r\\ndid not wish to betray her uneasiness. But the secluded position of\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov’s lodging had suddenly struck her. She wanted to ask\\r\\nwhether his landlady at least were at home, but pride kept her from\\r\\nasking. Moreover, she had another trouble in her heart incomparably\\r\\ngreater than fear for herself. She was in great distress.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here is your letter,” she said, laying it on the table. “Can it be true\\r\\nwhat you write? You hint at a crime committed, you say, by my brother.\\r\\nYou hint at it too clearly; you daren’t deny it now. I must tell you\\r\\nthat I’d heard of this stupid story before you wrote and don’t believe a\\r\\nword of it. It’s a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion. I know the story\\r\\nand why and how it was invented. You can have no proofs. You promised to\\r\\nprove it. Speak! But let me warn you that I don’t believe you! I don’t\\r\\nbelieve you!”\\r\\n\\r\\nDounia said this, speaking hurriedly, and for an instant the colour\\r\\nrushed to her face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you didn’t believe it, how could you risk coming alone to my rooms?\\r\\nWhy have you come? Simply from curiosity?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t torment me. Speak, speak!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s no denying that you are a brave girl. Upon my word, I thought\\r\\nyou would have asked Mr. Razumihin to escort you here. But he was not\\r\\nwith you nor anywhere near. I was on the look-out. It’s spirited of\\r\\nyou, it proves you wanted to spare Rodion Romanovitch. But everything\\r\\nis divine in you.... About your brother, what am I to say to you? You’ve\\r\\njust seen him yourself. What did you think of him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Surely that’s not the only thing you are building on?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, not on that, but on his own words. He came here on two successive\\r\\nevenings to see Sofya Semyonovna. I’ve shown you where they sat. He made\\r\\na full confession to her. He is a murderer. He killed an old woman, a\\r\\npawnbroker, with whom he had pawned things himself. He killed her sister\\r\\ntoo, a pedlar woman called Lizaveta, who happened to come in while he\\r\\nwas murdering her sister. He killed them with an axe he brought with\\r\\nhim. He murdered them to rob them and he did rob them. He took money and\\r\\nvarious things.... He told all this, word for word, to Sofya Semyonovna,\\r\\nthe only person who knows his secret. But she has had no share by word\\r\\nor deed in the murder; she was as horrified at it as you are now. Don’t\\r\\nbe anxious, she won’t betray him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It cannot be,” muttered Dounia, with white lips. She gasped for breath.\\r\\n“It cannot be. There was not the slightest cause, no sort of ground....\\r\\nIt’s a lie, a lie!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He robbed her, that was the cause, he took money and things. It’s true\\r\\nthat by his own admission he made no use of the money or things, but hid\\r\\nthem under a stone, where they are now. But that was because he dared\\r\\nnot make use of them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But how could he steal, rob? How could he dream of it?” cried Dounia,\\r\\nand she jumped up from the chair. “Why, you know him, and you’ve seen\\r\\nhim, can he be a thief?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe seemed to be imploring Svidrigaïlov; she had entirely forgotten her\\r\\nfear.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are thousands and millions of combinations and possibilities,\\r\\nAvdotya Romanovna. A thief steals and knows he is a scoundrel, but I’ve\\r\\nheard of a gentleman who broke open the mail. Who knows, very likely he\\r\\nthought he was doing a gentlemanly thing! Of course I should not have\\r\\nbelieved it myself if I’d been told of it as you have, but I believe my\\r\\nown ears. He explained all the causes of it to Sofya Semyonovna too, but\\r\\nshe did not believe her ears at first, yet she believed her own eyes at\\r\\nlast.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What... were the causes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a long story, Avdotya Romanovna. Here’s... how shall I tell\\r\\nyou?--A theory of a sort, the same one by which I for instance consider\\r\\nthat a single misdeed is permissible if the principal aim is right, a\\r\\nsolitary wrongdoing and hundreds of good deeds! It’s galling too, of\\r\\ncourse, for a young man of gifts and overweening pride to know that if\\r\\nhe had, for instance, a paltry three thousand, his whole career, his\\r\\nwhole future would be differently shaped and yet not to have that three\\r\\nthousand. Add to that, nervous irritability from hunger, from lodging\\r\\nin a hole, from rags, from a vivid sense of the charm of his social\\r\\nposition and his sister’s and mother’s position too. Above all, vanity,\\r\\npride and vanity, though goodness knows he may have good qualities\\r\\ntoo.... I am not blaming him, please don’t think it; besides, it’s not\\r\\nmy business. A special little theory came in too--a theory of a\\r\\nsort--dividing mankind, you see, into material and superior persons,\\r\\nthat is persons to whom the law does not apply owing to their\\r\\nsuperiority, who make laws for the rest of mankind, the material, that\\r\\nis. It’s all right as a theory, _une théorie comme une autre_. Napoleon\\r\\nattracted him tremendously, that is, what affected him was that a\\r\\ngreat many men of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing, but have\\r\\noverstepped the law without thinking about it. He seems to have fancied\\r\\nthat he was a genius too--that is, he was convinced of it for a time. He\\r\\nhas suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he\\r\\ncould make a theory, but was incapable of boldly overstepping the law,\\r\\nand so he is not a man of genius. And that’s humiliating for a young man\\r\\nof any pride, in our day especially....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But remorse? You deny him any moral feeling then? Is he like that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, Avdotya Romanovna, everything is in a muddle now; not that it was\\r\\never in very good order. Russians in general are broad in their ideas,\\r\\nAvdotya Romanovna, broad like their land and exceedingly disposed to\\r\\nthe fantastic, the chaotic. But it’s a misfortune to be broad without\\r\\na special genius. Do you remember what a lot of talk we had together on\\r\\nthis subject, sitting in the evenings on the terrace after supper? Why,\\r\\nyou used to reproach me with breadth! Who knows, perhaps we were talking\\r\\nat the very time when he was lying here thinking over his plan. There\\r\\nare no sacred traditions amongst us, especially in the educated class,\\r\\nAvdotya Romanovna. At the best someone will make them up somehow for\\r\\nhimself out of books or from some old chronicle. But those are for the\\r\\nmost part the learned and all old fogeys, so that it would be almost\\r\\nill-bred in a man of society. You know my opinions in general, though. I\\r\\nnever blame anyone. I do nothing at all, I persevere in that. But\\r\\nwe’ve talked of this more than once before. I was so happy indeed as to\\r\\ninterest you in my opinions.... You are very pale, Avdotya Romanovna.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know his theory. I read that article of his about men to whom all is\\r\\npermitted. Razumihin brought it to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Razumihin? Your brother’s article? In a magazine? Is there such an\\r\\narticle? I didn’t know. It must be interesting. But where are you going,\\r\\nAvdotya Romanovna?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I want to see Sofya Semyonovna,” Dounia articulated faintly. “How do I\\r\\ngo to her? She has come in, perhaps. I must see her at once. Perhaps\\r\\nshe...”\\r\\n\\r\\nAvdotya Romanovna could not finish. Her breath literally failed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sofya Semyonovna will not be back till night, at least I believe not.\\r\\nShe was to have been back at once, but if not, then she will not be in\\r\\ntill quite late.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, then you are lying! I see... you were lying... lying all the\\r\\ntime.... I don’t believe you! I don’t believe you!” cried Dounia,\\r\\ncompletely losing her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost fainting, she sank on to a chair which Svidrigaïlov made haste to\\r\\ngive her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Avdotya Romanovna, what is it? Control yourself! Here is some water.\\r\\nDrink a little....”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sprinkled some water over her. Dounia shuddered and came to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It has acted violently,” Svidrigaïlov muttered to himself, frowning.\\r\\n“Avdotya Romanovna, calm yourself! Believe me, he has friends. We will\\r\\nsave him. Would you like me to take him abroad? I have money, I can get\\r\\na ticket in three days. And as for the murder, he will do all sorts of\\r\\ngood deeds yet, to atone for it. Calm yourself. He may become a great\\r\\nman yet. Well, how are you? How do you feel?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Cruel man! To be able to jeer at it! Let me go...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where are you going?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To him. Where is he? Do you know? Why is this door locked? We came in\\r\\nat that door and now it is locked. When did you manage to lock it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We couldn’t be shouting all over the flat on such a subject. I am far\\r\\nfrom jeering; it’s simply that I’m sick of talking like this. But how\\r\\ncan you go in such a state? Do you want to betray him? You will drive\\r\\nhim to fury, and he will give himself up. Let me tell you, he is already\\r\\nbeing watched; they are already on his track. You will simply be giving\\r\\nhim away. Wait a little: I saw him and was talking to him just now. He\\r\\ncan still be saved. Wait a bit, sit down; let us think it over together.\\r\\nI asked you to come in order to discuss it alone with you and to\\r\\nconsider it thoroughly. But do sit down!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How can you save him? Can he really be saved?”\\r\\n\\r\\nDounia sat down. Svidrigaïlov sat down beside her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It all depends on you, on you, on you alone,” he began with glowing\\r\\neyes, almost in a whisper and hardly able to utter the words for\\r\\nemotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nDounia drew back from him in alarm. He too was trembling all over.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You... one word from you, and he is saved. I... I’ll save him. I have\\r\\nmoney and friends. I’ll send him away at once. I’ll get a passport,\\r\\ntwo passports, one for him and one for me. I have friends... capable\\r\\npeople.... If you like, I’ll take a passport for you... for your\\r\\nmother.... What do you want with Razumihin? I love you too.... I love\\r\\nyou beyond everything.... Let me kiss the hem of your dress, let me, let\\r\\nme.... The very rustle of it is too much for me. Tell me, ‘do that,’\\r\\nand I’ll do it. I’ll do everything. I will do the impossible. What you\\r\\nbelieve, I will believe. I’ll do anything--anything! Don’t, don’t look\\r\\nat me like that. Do you know that you are killing me?...”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was almost beginning to rave.... Something seemed suddenly to go to\\r\\nhis head. Dounia jumped up and rushed to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Open it! Open it!” she called, shaking the door. “Open it! Is there no\\r\\none there?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov got up and came to himself. His still trembling lips slowly\\r\\nbroke into an angry mocking smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is no one at home,” he said quietly and emphatically. “The\\r\\nlandlady has gone out, and it’s waste of time to shout like that. You\\r\\nare only exciting yourself uselessly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where is the key? Open the door at once, at once, base man!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have lost the key and cannot find it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is an outrage,” cried Dounia, turning pale as death. She rushed\\r\\nto the furthest corner, where she made haste to barricade herself with a\\r\\nlittle table.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not scream, but she fixed her eyes on her tormentor and watched\\r\\nevery movement he made.\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov remained standing at the other end of the room facing her.\\r\\nHe was positively composed, at least in appearance, but his face was\\r\\npale as before. The mocking smile did not leave his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You spoke of outrage just now, Avdotya Romanovna. In that case you\\r\\nmay be sure I’ve taken measures. Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. The\\r\\nKapernaumovs are far away--there are five locked rooms between. I am at\\r\\nleast twice as strong as you are and I have nothing to fear, besides.\\r\\nFor you could not complain afterwards. You surely would not be willing\\r\\nactually to betray your brother? Besides, no one would believe you. How\\r\\nshould a girl have come alone to visit a solitary man in his lodgings?\\r\\nSo that even if you do sacrifice your brother, you could prove nothing.\\r\\nIt is very difficult to prove an assault, Avdotya Romanovna.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Scoundrel!” whispered Dounia indignantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“As you like, but observe I was only speaking by way of a general\\r\\nproposition. It’s my personal conviction that you are perfectly\\r\\nright--violence is hateful. I only spoke to show you that you need have\\r\\nno remorse even if... you were willing to save your brother of your\\r\\nown accord, as I suggest to you. You would be simply submitting to\\r\\ncircumstances, to violence, in fact, if we must use that word. Think\\r\\nabout it. Your brother’s and your mother’s fate are in your hands. I\\r\\nwill be your slave... all my life... I will wait here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from Dounia. She had\\r\\nnot the slightest doubt now of his unbending determination. Besides, she\\r\\nknew him. Suddenly she pulled out of her pocket a revolver, cocked it\\r\\nand laid it in her hand on the table. Svidrigaïlov jumped up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Aha! So that’s it, is it?” he cried, surprised but smiling maliciously.\\r\\n“Well, that completely alters the aspect of affairs. You’ve made things\\r\\nwonderfully easier for me, Avdotya Romanovna. But where did you get the\\r\\nrevolver? Was it Mr. Razumihin? Why, it’s my revolver, an old friend!\\r\\nAnd how I’ve hunted for it! The shooting lessons I’ve given you in the\\r\\ncountry have not been thrown away.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not your revolver, it belonged to Marfa Petrovna, whom you killed,\\r\\nwretch! There was nothing of yours in her house. I took it when I began\\r\\nto suspect what you were capable of. If you dare to advance one step, I\\r\\nswear I’ll kill you.” She was frantic.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But your brother? I ask from curiosity,” said Svidrigaïlov, still\\r\\nstanding where he was.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Inform, if you want to! Don’t stir! Don’t come nearer! I’ll shoot! You\\r\\npoisoned your wife, I know; you are a murderer yourself!” She held the\\r\\nrevolver ready.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you so positive I poisoned Marfa Petrovna?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You did! You hinted it yourself; you talked to me of poison.... I know\\r\\nyou went to get it... you had it in readiness.... It was your doing....\\r\\nIt must have been your doing.... Scoundrel!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Even if that were true, it would have been for your sake... you would\\r\\nhave been the cause.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are lying! I hated you always, always....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oho, Avdotya Romanovna! You seem to have forgotten how you softened\\r\\nto me in the heat of propaganda. I saw it in your eyes. Do you remember\\r\\nthat moonlight night, when the nightingale was singing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s a lie,” there was a flash of fury in Dounia’s eyes, “that’s a\\r\\nlie and a libel!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A lie? Well, if you like, it’s a lie. I made it up. Women ought not\\r\\nto be reminded of such things,” he smiled. “I know you will shoot, you\\r\\npretty wild creature. Well, shoot away!”\\r\\n\\r\\nDounia raised the revolver, and deadly pale, gazed at him, measuring the\\r\\ndistance and awaiting the first movement on his part. Her lower lip was\\r\\nwhite and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire. He had\\r\\nnever seen her so handsome. The fire glowing in her eyes at the moment\\r\\nshe raised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there was a pang of\\r\\nanguish in his heart. He took a step forward and a shot rang out. The\\r\\nbullet grazed his hair and flew into the wall behind. He stood still and\\r\\nlaughed softly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The wasp has stung me. She aimed straight at my head. What’s this?\\r\\nBlood?” he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the blood, which flowed\\r\\nin a thin stream down his right temple. The bullet seemed to have just\\r\\ngrazed the skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nDounia lowered the revolver and looked at Svidrigaïlov not so much in\\r\\nterror as in a sort of wild amazement. She seemed not to understand what\\r\\nshe was doing and what was going on.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you missed! Fire again, I’ll wait,” said Svidrigaïlov softly,\\r\\nstill smiling, but gloomily. “If you go on like that, I shall have time\\r\\nto seize you before you cock again.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDounia started, quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me be,” she cried in despair. “I swear I’ll shoot again. I... I’ll\\r\\nkill you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well... at three paces you can hardly help it. But if you don’t...\\r\\nthen.” His eyes flashed and he took two steps forward. Dounia shot\\r\\nagain: it missed fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You haven’t loaded it properly. Never mind, you have another charge\\r\\nthere. Get it ready, I’ll wait.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood facing her, two paces away, waiting and gazing at her with wild\\r\\ndetermination, with feverishly passionate, stubborn, set eyes. Dounia\\r\\nsaw that he would sooner die than let her go. “And... now, of course she\\r\\nwould kill him, at two paces!” Suddenly she flung away the revolver.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She’s dropped it!” said Svidrigaïlov with surprise, and he drew a deep\\r\\nbreath. A weight seemed to have rolled from his heart--perhaps not only\\r\\nthe fear of death; indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment.\\r\\nIt was the deliverance from another feeling, darker and more bitter,\\r\\nwhich he could not himself have defined.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her waist. She did not\\r\\nresist, but, trembling like a leaf, looked at him with suppliant eyes.\\r\\nHe tried to say something, but his lips moved without being able to\\r\\nutter a sound.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me go,” Dounia implored. Svidrigaïlov shuddered. Her voice now was\\r\\nquite different.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you don’t love me?” he asked softly. Dounia shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And... and you can’t? Never?” he whispered in despair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere followed a moment of terrible, dumb struggle in the heart of\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov. He looked at her with an indescribable gaze. Suddenly\\r\\nhe withdrew his arm, turned quickly to the window and stood facing it.\\r\\nAnother moment passed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here’s the key.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table\\r\\nbehind him, without turning or looking at Dounia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Take it! Make haste!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked stubbornly out of the window. Dounia went up to the table to\\r\\ntake the key.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Make haste! Make haste!” repeated Svidrigaïlov, still without turning\\r\\nor moving. But there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that\\r\\n“make haste.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew to the door, unlocked it\\r\\nquickly and rushed out of the room. A minute later, beside herself, she\\r\\nran out on to the canal bank in the direction of X. Bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov remained three minutes standing at the window. At last he\\r\\nslowly turned, looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead. A\\r\\nstrange smile contorted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of\\r\\ndespair. The blood, which was already getting dry, smeared his hand.\\r\\nHe looked angrily at it, then wetted a towel and washed his temple.\\r\\nThe revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly\\r\\ncaught his eye. He picked it up and examined it. It was a little pocket\\r\\nthree-barrel revolver of old-fashioned construction. There were still\\r\\ntwo charges and one capsule left in it. It could be fired again. He\\r\\nthought a little, put the revolver in his pocket, took his hat and went\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\nHe spent that evening till ten o’clock going from one low haunt to\\r\\nanother. Katia too turned up and sang another gutter song, how a certain\\r\\n\\r\\n“villain and tyrant,”\\r\\n\\r\\n“began kissing Katia.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and some singers and\\r\\nthe waiters and two little clerks. He was particularly drawn to these\\r\\nclerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses, one bent to the\\r\\nleft and the other to the right. They took him finally to a pleasure\\r\\ngarden, where he paid for their entrance. There was one lanky\\r\\nthree-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a\\r\\n“Vauxhall,” which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was\\r\\nserved, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it.\\r\\nA chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed\\r\\nGerman clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public. The\\r\\nclerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent.\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov was chosen to decide the dispute. He listened to them for\\r\\na quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that there was no\\r\\npossibility of understanding them. The only fact that seemed certain was\\r\\nthat one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in\\r\\nselling it on the spot to a Jew, but would not share the spoil with his\\r\\ncompanion. Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon\\r\\nbelonging to the Vauxhall. It was missed and the affair began to seem\\r\\ntroublesome. Svidrigaïlov paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out of\\r\\nthe garden. It was about six o’clock. He had not drunk a drop of wine\\r\\nall this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than\\r\\nanything.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a dark and stifling evening. Threatening storm-clouds came over\\r\\nthe sky about ten o’clock. There was a clap of thunder, and the rain\\r\\ncame down like a waterfall. The water fell not in drops, but beat on the\\r\\nearth in streams. There were flashes of lightning every minute and each\\r\\nflash lasted while one could count five.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, opened the\\r\\nbureau, took out all his money and tore up two or three papers. Then,\\r\\nputting the money in his pocket, he was about to change his clothes,\\r\\nbut, looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the\\r\\nrain, he gave up the idea, took up his hat and went out of the room\\r\\nwithout locking the door. He went straight to Sonia. She was at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were with her. She\\r\\nwas giving them tea. She received Svidrigaïlov in respectful silence,\\r\\nlooking wonderingly at his soaking clothes. The children all ran away at\\r\\nonce in indescribable terror.\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him.\\r\\nShe timidly prepared to listen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I may be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna,” said Svidrigaïlov, “and\\r\\nas I am probably seeing you for the last time, I have come to make some\\r\\narrangements. Well, did you see the lady to-day? I know what she said to\\r\\nyou, you need not tell me.” (Sonia made a movement and blushed.) “Those\\r\\npeople have their own way of doing things. As to your sisters and your\\r\\nbrother, they are really provided for and the money assigned to them\\r\\nI’ve put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments. You had\\r\\nbetter take charge of the receipts, in case anything happens. Here, take\\r\\nthem! Well now, that’s settled. Here are three 5-per-cent bonds to the\\r\\nvalue of three thousand roubles. Take those for yourself, entirely for\\r\\nyourself, and let that be strictly between ourselves, so that no one\\r\\nknows of it, whatever you hear. You will need the money, for to go on\\r\\nliving in the old way, Sofya Semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is no\\r\\nneed for it now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am so much indebted to you, and so are the children and my\\r\\nstepmother,” said Sonia hurriedly, “and if I’ve said so little... please\\r\\ndon’t consider...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s enough! that’s enough!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But as for the money, Arkady Ivanovitch, I am very grateful to you,\\r\\nbut I don’t need it now. I can always earn my own living. Don’t think me\\r\\nungrateful. If you are so charitable, that money....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s for you, for you, Sofya Semyonovna, and please don’t waste words\\r\\nover it. I haven’t time for it. You will want it. Rodion Romanovitch\\r\\nhas two alternatives: a bullet in the brain or Siberia.” (Sonia looked\\r\\nwildly at him, and started.) “Don’t be uneasy, I know all about it from\\r\\nhimself and I am not a gossip; I won’t tell anyone. It was good advice\\r\\nwhen you told him to give himself up and confess. It would be much\\r\\nbetter for him. Well, if it turns out to be Siberia, he will go and\\r\\nyou will follow him. That’s so, isn’t it? And if so, you’ll need money.\\r\\nYou’ll need it for him, do you understand? Giving it to you is the same\\r\\nas my giving it to him. Besides, you promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay\\r\\nwhat’s owing. I heard you. How can you undertake such obligations so\\r\\nheedlessly, Sofya Semyonovna? It was Katerina Ivanovna’s debt and not\\r\\nyours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman.\\r\\nYou can’t get through the world like that. If you are ever questioned\\r\\nabout me--to-morrow or the day after you will be asked--don’t say\\r\\nanything about my coming to see you now and don’t show the money to\\r\\nanyone or say a word about it. Well, now good-bye.” (He got up.) “My\\r\\ngreetings to Rodion Romanovitch. By the way, you’d better put the money\\r\\nfor the present in Mr. Razumihin’s keeping. You know Mr. Razumihin? Of\\r\\ncourse you do. He’s not a bad fellow. Take it to him to-morrow or...\\r\\nwhen the time comes. And till then, hide it carefully.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at Svidrigaïlov.\\r\\nShe longed to speak, to ask a question, but for the first moments she\\r\\ndid not dare and did not know how to begin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How can you... how can you be going now, in such rain?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, be starting for America, and be stopped by rain! Ha, ha! Good-bye,\\r\\nSofya Semyonovna, my dear! Live and live long, you will be of use to\\r\\nothers. By the way... tell Mr. Razumihin I send my greetings to him.\\r\\nTell him Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov sends his greetings. Be sure\\r\\nto.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went out, leaving Sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague\\r\\napprehension.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at twenty past eleven,\\r\\nhe made another very eccentric and unexpected visit. The rain still\\r\\npersisted. Drenched to the skin, he walked into the little flat where\\r\\nthe parents of his betrothed lived, in Third Street in Vassilyevsky\\r\\nIsland. He knocked some time before he was admitted, and his visit\\r\\nat first caused great perturbation; but Svidrigaïlov could be\\r\\nvery fascinating when he liked, so that the first, and indeed very\\r\\nintelligent surmise of the sensible parents that Svidrigaïlov had\\r\\nprobably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing\\r\\nvanished immediately. The decrepit father was wheeled in to see\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov by the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the\\r\\nconversation with various irrelevant questions. She never asked a direct\\r\\nquestion, but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then, if she\\r\\nwere obliged to ascertain something--for instance, when Svidrigaïlov\\r\\nwould like to have the wedding--she would begin by interested and\\r\\nalmost eager questions about Paris and the court life there, and only\\r\\nby degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street. On other\\r\\noccasions this had of course been very impressive, but this time Arkady\\r\\nIvanovitch seemed particularly impatient, and insisted on seeing his\\r\\nbetrothed at once, though he had been informed, to begin with, that she\\r\\nhad already gone to bed. The girl of course appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov informed her at once that he was obliged by very important\\r\\naffairs to leave Petersburg for a time, and therefore brought her\\r\\nfifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present from\\r\\nhim, as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present\\r\\nbefore their wedding. The logical connection of the present with his\\r\\nimmediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that\\r\\npurpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear. But it all went\\r\\noff very well; even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret,\\r\\nthe inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained. On the\\r\\nother hand, the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced\\r\\nby tears from the most sensible of mothers. Svidrigaïlov got up,\\r\\nlaughed, kissed his betrothed, patted her cheek, declared he would soon\\r\\ncome back, and noticing in her eyes, together with childish curiosity, a\\r\\nsort of earnest dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her again, though\\r\\nhe felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be\\r\\nimmediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers. He\\r\\nwent away, leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement, but\\r\\nthe tender mamma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of\\r\\nthe most important of their doubts, concluding that Svidrigaïlov was\\r\\na great man, a man of great affairs and connections and of great\\r\\nwealth--there was no knowing what he had in his mind. He would start\\r\\noff on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him, so that\\r\\nthere was nothing surprising about it. Of course it was strange that he\\r\\nwas wet through, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more eccentric,\\r\\nand all these people of high society didn’t think of what was said of\\r\\nthem and didn’t stand on ceremony. Possibly, indeed, he came like that\\r\\non purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone. Above all, not a\\r\\nword should be said about it, for God knows what might come of it, and\\r\\nthe money must be locked up, and it was most fortunate that Fedosya, the\\r\\ncook, had not left the kitchen. And above all not a word must be said\\r\\nto that old cat, Madame Resslich, and so on and so on. They sat up\\r\\nwhispering till two o’clock, but the girl went to bed much earlier,\\r\\namazed and rather sorrowful.\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed the bridge on the\\r\\nway back to the mainland. The rain had ceased and there was a roaring\\r\\nwind. He began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the black\\r\\nwaters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry.\\r\\nBut he soon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he turned and\\r\\nwent towards Y. Prospect. He walked along that endless street for a long\\r\\ntime, almost half an hour, more than once stumbling in the dark on the\\r\\nwooden pavement, but continually looking for something on the right side\\r\\nof the street. He had noticed passing through this street lately that\\r\\nthere was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but fairly\\r\\nlarge, and its name he remembered was something like Adrianople. He was\\r\\nnot mistaken: the hotel was so conspicuous in that God-forsaken place\\r\\nthat he could not fail to see it even in the dark. It was a long,\\r\\nblackened wooden building, and in spite of the late hour there were\\r\\nlights in the windows and signs of life within. He went in and asked\\r\\na ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. The latter,\\r\\nscanning Svidrigaïlov, pulled himself together and led him at once to a\\r\\nclose and tiny room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, under\\r\\nthe stairs. There was no other, all were occupied. The ragged fellow\\r\\nlooked inquiringly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is there tea?” asked Svidrigaïlov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What else is there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Veal, vodka, savouries.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Bring me tea and veal.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you want nothing else?” he asked with apparent surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing, nothing.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ragged man went away, completely disillusioned.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It must be a nice place,” thought Svidrigaïlov. “How was it I didn’t\\r\\nknow it? I expect I look as if I came from a café chantant and have\\r\\nhad some adventure on the way. It would be interesting to know who stayed\\r\\nhere?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully. It was a\\r\\nroom so low-pitched that Svidrigaïlov could only just stand up in it;\\r\\nit had one window; the bed, which was very dirty, and the plain-stained\\r\\nchair and table almost filled it up. The walls looked as though they\\r\\nwere made of planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty\\r\\nthat the pattern was indistinguishable, though the general\\r\\ncolour--yellow--could still be made out. One of the walls was cut short\\r\\nby the sloping ceiling, though the room was not an attic but just under\\r\\nthe stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov set down the candle, sat down on the bed and sank into\\r\\nthought. But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout\\r\\nin the next room attracted his attention. The murmur had not ceased from\\r\\nthe moment he entered the room. He listened: someone was upbraiding and\\r\\nalmost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov got up, shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw\\r\\nlight through a crack in the wall; he went up and peeped through. The\\r\\nroom, which was somewhat larger than his, had two occupants. One of\\r\\nthem, a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing\\r\\nin the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide apart to\\r\\npreserve his balance, and smiting himself on the breast. He reproached\\r\\nthe other with being a beggar, with having no standing whatever. He\\r\\ndeclared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn\\r\\nhim out when he liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees it\\r\\nall. The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and had the\\r\\nair of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but can’t. He sometimes\\r\\nturned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker, but obviously had not\\r\\nthe slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it. A\\r\\ncandle was burning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a nearly\\r\\nempty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses with the dregs\\r\\nof stale tea. After gazing attentively at this, Svidrigaïlov turned away\\r\\nindifferently and sat down on the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not resist asking\\r\\nhim again whether he didn’t want anything more, and again receiving a\\r\\nnegative reply, finally withdrew. Svidrigaïlov made haste to drink a\\r\\nglass of tea to warm himself, but could not eat anything. He began\\r\\nto feel feverish. He took off his coat and, wrapping himself in the\\r\\nblanket, lay down on the bed. He was annoyed. “It would have been better\\r\\nto be well for the occasion,” he thought with a smile. The room was\\r\\nclose, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was roaring outside, he heard\\r\\na mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of\\r\\nleather. He lay in a sort of reverie: one thought followed another. He\\r\\nfelt a longing to fix his imagination on something. “It must be a garden\\r\\nunder the window,” he thought. “There’s a sound of trees. How I dislike\\r\\nthe sound of trees on a stormy night, in the dark! They give one a\\r\\nhorrid feeling.” He remembered how he had disliked it when he passed\\r\\nPetrovsky Park just now. This reminded him of the bridge over the Little\\r\\nNeva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there. “I never have\\r\\nliked water,” he thought, “even in a landscape,” and he suddenly smiled\\r\\nagain at a strange idea: “Surely now all these questions of taste and\\r\\ncomfort ought not to matter, but I’ve become more particular, like an\\r\\nanimal that picks out a special place... for such an occasion. I ought\\r\\nto have gone into the Petrovsky Park! I suppose it seemed dark, cold,\\r\\nha-ha! As though I were seeking pleasant sensations!... By the way, why\\r\\nhaven’t I put out the candle?” he blew it out. “They’ve gone to bed next\\r\\ndoor,” he thought, not seeing the light at the crack. “Well, now, Marfa\\r\\nPetrovna, now is the time for you to turn up; it’s dark, and the very\\r\\ntime and place for you. But now you won’t come!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out his design on\\r\\nDounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov to trust her to Razumihin’s\\r\\nkeeping. “I suppose I really did say it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to\\r\\ntease myself. But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is! He’s gone through a\\r\\ngood deal. He may be a successful rogue in time when he’s got over\\r\\nhis nonsense. But now he’s _too_ eager for life. These young men\\r\\nare contemptible on that point. But, hang the fellow! Let him please\\r\\nhimself, it’s nothing to do with me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could not get to sleep. By degrees Dounia’s image rose before him,\\r\\nand a shudder ran over him. “No, I must give up all that now,” he\\r\\nthought, rousing himself. “I must think of something else. It’s queer\\r\\nand funny. I never had a great hatred for anyone, I never particularly\\r\\ndesired to avenge myself even, and that’s a bad sign, a bad sign, a bad\\r\\nsign. I never liked quarrelling either, and never lost my temper--that’s\\r\\na bad sign too. And the promises I made her just now, too--Damnation!\\r\\nBut--who knows?--perhaps she would have made a new man of me\\r\\nsomehow....”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ground his teeth and sank into silence again. Again Dounia’s image\\r\\nrose before him, just as she was when, after shooting the first time,\\r\\nshe had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him, so that\\r\\nhe might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand\\r\\nto defend herself if he had not reminded her. He recalled how at that\\r\\ninstant he felt almost sorry for her, how he had felt a pang at his\\r\\nheart...\\r\\n\\r\\n“Aïe! Damnation, these thoughts again! I must put it away!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was dozing off; the feverish shiver had ceased, when suddenly\\r\\nsomething seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes. He\\r\\nstarted. “Ugh! hang it! I believe it’s a mouse,” he thought, “that’s the\\r\\nveal I left on the table.” He felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the\\r\\nblanket, get up, get cold, but all at once something unpleasant ran over\\r\\nhis leg again. He pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle. Shaking\\r\\nwith feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed: there was nothing.\\r\\nHe shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet.\\r\\nHe tried to catch it, but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without\\r\\nleaving the bed, slipped between his fingers, ran over his hand and\\r\\nsuddenly darted under the pillow. He threw down the pillow, but in one\\r\\ninstant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down\\r\\nhis back under his shirt. He trembled nervously and woke up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was dark. He was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket\\r\\nas before. The wind was howling under the window. “How disgusting,” he\\r\\nthought with annoyance.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the\\r\\nwindow. “It’s better not to sleep at all,” he decided. There was a cold\\r\\ndamp draught from the window, however; without getting up he drew the\\r\\nblanket over him and wrapped himself in it. He was not thinking of\\r\\nanything and did not want to think. But one image rose after another,\\r\\nincoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through his\\r\\nmind. He sank into drowsiness. Perhaps the cold, or the dampness, or\\r\\nthe dark, or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees\\r\\nroused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic. He kept dwelling\\r\\non images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden, a bright,\\r\\nwarm, almost hot day, a holiday--Trinity day. A fine, sumptuous country\\r\\ncottage in the English taste overgrown with fragrant flowers, with\\r\\nflower beds going round the house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, was\\r\\nsurrounded with beds of roses. A light, cool staircase, carpeted with\\r\\nrich rugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots. He noticed\\r\\nparticularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, heavily fragrant\\r\\nnarcissus bending over their bright, green, thick long stalks. He was\\r\\nreluctant to move away from them, but he went up the stairs and came\\r\\ninto a large, high drawing-room and again everywhere--at the windows,\\r\\nthe doors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself--were flowers.\\r\\nThe floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant hay, the windows\\r\\nwere open, a fresh, cool, light air came into the room. The birds were\\r\\nchirruping under the window, and in the middle of the room, on a table\\r\\ncovered with a white satin shroud, stood a coffin. The coffin was\\r\\ncovered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths of\\r\\nflowers surrounded it on all sides. Among the flowers lay a girl in a\\r\\nwhite muslin dress, with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom, as\\r\\nthough carved out of marble. But her loose fair hair was wet; there was\\r\\na wreath of roses on her head. The stern and already rigid profile of\\r\\nher face looked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on her\\r\\npale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal.\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov knew that girl; there was no holy image, no burning candle\\r\\nbeside the coffin; no sound of prayers: the girl had drowned herself.\\r\\nShe was only fourteen, but her heart was broken. And she had destroyed\\r\\nherself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish\\r\\nsoul, had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn\\r\\nfrom her a last scream of despair, unheeded and brutally disregarded, on\\r\\na dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled....\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov came to himself, got up from the bed and went to the\\r\\nwindow. He felt for the latch and opened it. The wind lashed furiously\\r\\ninto the little room and stung his face and his chest, only covered with\\r\\nhis shirt, as though with frost. Under the window there must have been\\r\\nsomething like a garden, and apparently a pleasure garden. There, too,\\r\\nprobably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime. Now drops of\\r\\nrain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes; it was dark as\\r\\nin a cellar, so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of\\r\\nobjects. Svidrigaïlov, bending down with elbows on the window-sill,\\r\\ngazed for five minutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed\\r\\nby a second one, resounded in the darkness of the night. “Ah, the\\r\\nsignal! The river is overflowing,” he thought. “By morning it will be\\r\\nswirling down the street in the lower parts, flooding the basements and\\r\\ncellars. The cellar rats will swim out, and men will curse in the rain\\r\\nand wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys. What time is\\r\\nit now?” And he had hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock on\\r\\nthe wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Aha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? I’ll go out at once\\r\\nstraight to the park. I’ll choose a great bush there drenched with rain,\\r\\nso that as soon as one’s shoulder touches it, millions of drops drip on\\r\\none’s head.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the candle, put on his\\r\\nwaistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and went out, carrying the candle,\\r\\ninto the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep\\r\\nsomewhere in the midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay\\r\\nhim for the room and leave the hotel. “It’s the best minute; I couldn’t\\r\\nchoose a better.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding\\r\\nanyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corner\\r\\nbetween an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object\\r\\nwhich seemed to be alive. He bent down with the candle and saw a little\\r\\ngirl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her\\r\\nclothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel. She did not seem afraid of\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov, but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big\\r\\nblack eyes. Now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been\\r\\ncrying a long time, but are beginning to be comforted. The child’s face\\r\\nwas pale and tired, she was numb with cold. “How can she have come here?\\r\\nShe must have hidden here and not slept all night.” He began questioning\\r\\nher. The child suddenly becoming animated, chattered away in her baby\\r\\nlanguage, something about “mammy” and that “mammy would beat her,” and\\r\\nabout some cup that she had “bwoken.” The child chattered on without\\r\\nstopping. He could only guess from what she said that she was a\\r\\nneglected child, whose mother, probably a drunken cook, in the service\\r\\nof the hotel, whipped and frightened her; that the child had broken\\r\\na cup of her mother’s and was so frightened that she had run away the\\r\\nevening before, had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the\\r\\nrain, at last had made her way in here, hidden behind the cupboard and\\r\\nspent the night there, crying and trembling from the damp, the darkness\\r\\nand the fear that she would be badly beaten for it. He took her in his\\r\\narms, went back to his room, sat her on the bed, and began undressing\\r\\nher. The torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as\\r\\nwet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night. When he had\\r\\nundressed her, he put her on the bed, covered her up and wrapped her in\\r\\nthe blanket from her head downwards. She fell asleep at once. Then he\\r\\nsank into dreary musing again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What folly to trouble myself,” he decided suddenly with an oppressive\\r\\nfeeling of annoyance. “What idiocy!” In vexation he took up the candle\\r\\nto go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away.\\r\\n“Damn the child!” he thought as he opened the door, but he turned again\\r\\nto see whether the child was asleep. He raised the blanket carefully.\\r\\nThe child was sleeping soundly, she had got warm under the blanket,\\r\\nand her pale cheeks were flushed. But strange to say that flush seemed\\r\\nbrighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood. “It’s a flush\\r\\nof fever,” thought Svidrigaïlov. It was like the flush from drinking, as\\r\\nthough she had been given a full glass to drink. Her crimson lips were\\r\\nhot and glowing; but what was this? He suddenly fancied that her long\\r\\nblack eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids were opening and a\\r\\nsly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink, as though the little\\r\\ngirl were not asleep, but pretending. Yes, it was so. Her lips parted in\\r\\na smile. The corners of her mouth quivered, as though she were trying to\\r\\ncontrol them. But now she quite gave up all effort, now it was a grin,\\r\\na broad grin; there was something shameless, provocative in that quite\\r\\nunchildish face; it was depravity, it was the face of a harlot, the\\r\\nshameless face of a French harlot. Now both eyes opened wide; they\\r\\nturned a glowing, shameless glance upon him; they laughed, invited\\r\\nhim.... There was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that\\r\\nlaugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of a child. “What,\\r\\nat five years old?” Svidrigaïlov muttered in genuine horror. “What does\\r\\nit mean?” And now she turned to him, her little face all aglow, holding\\r\\nout her arms.... “Accursed child!” Svidrigaïlov cried, raising his hand\\r\\nto strike her, but at that moment he woke up.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket. The candle had not\\r\\nbeen lighted, and daylight was streaming in at the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve had nightmare all night!” He got up angrily, feeling utterly\\r\\nshattered; his bones ached. There was a thick mist outside and he could\\r\\nsee nothing. It was nearly five. He had overslept himself! He got up,\\r\\nput on his still damp jacket and overcoat. Feeling the revolver in his\\r\\npocket, he took it out and then he sat down, took a notebook out of his\\r\\npocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few\\r\\nlines in large letters. Reading them over, he sank into thought with his\\r\\nelbows on the table. The revolver and the notebook lay beside him. Some\\r\\nflies woke up and settled on the untouched veal, which was still on\\r\\nthe table. He stared at them and at last with his free right hand began\\r\\ntrying to catch one. He tried till he was tired, but could not catch it.\\r\\nAt last, realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit, he\\r\\nstarted, got up and walked resolutely out of the room. A minute later he\\r\\nwas in the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nA thick milky mist hung over the town. Svidrigaïlov walked along the\\r\\nslippery dirty wooden pavement towards the Little Neva. He was picturing\\r\\nthe waters of the Little Neva swollen in the night, Petrovsky Island,\\r\\nthe wet paths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes and at last the\\r\\nbush.... He began ill-humouredly staring at the houses, trying to think\\r\\nof something else. There was not a cabman or a passer-by in the street.\\r\\nThe bright yellow, wooden, little houses looked dirty and dejected with\\r\\ntheir closed shutters. The cold and damp penetrated his whole body and\\r\\nhe began to shiver. From time to time he came across shop signs and read\\r\\neach carefully. At last he reached the end of the wooden pavement and\\r\\ncame to a big stone house. A dirty, shivering dog crossed his path with\\r\\nits tail between its legs. A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead\\r\\ndrunk, across the pavement. He looked at him and went on. A high tower\\r\\nstood up on the left. “Bah!” he shouted, “here is a place. Why should\\r\\nit be Petrovsky? It will be in the presence of an official witness\\r\\nanyway....”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where\\r\\nthere was the big house with the tower. At the great closed gates of\\r\\nthe house, a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them,\\r\\nwrapped in a grey soldier’s coat, with a copper Achilles helmet on his\\r\\nhead. He cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at Svidrigaïlov. His\\r\\nface wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection, which is so sourly\\r\\nprinted on all faces of Jewish race without exception. They both,\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov and Achilles, stared at each other for a few minutes\\r\\nwithout speaking. At last it struck Achilles as irregular for a man\\r\\nnot drunk to be standing three steps from him, staring and not saying a\\r\\nword.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you want here?” he said, without moving or changing his\\r\\nposition.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing, brother, good morning,” answered Svidrigaïlov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This isn’t the place.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am going to foreign parts, brother.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To foreign parts?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To America.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“America.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov took out the revolver and cocked it. Achilles raised his\\r\\neyebrows.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say, this is not the place for such jokes!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why shouldn’t it be the place?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because it isn’t.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, brother, I don’t mind that. It’s a good place. When you are\\r\\nasked, you just say he was going, he said, to America.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put the revolver to his right temple.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can’t do it here, it’s not the place,” cried Achilles, rousing\\r\\nhimself, his eyes growing bigger and bigger.\\r\\n\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov pulled the trigger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same day, about seven o’clock in the evening, Raskolnikov was on\\r\\nhis way to his mother’s and sister’s lodging--the lodging in Bakaleyev’s\\r\\nhouse which Razumihin had found for them. The stairs went up from\\r\\nthe street. Raskolnikov walked with lagging steps, as though still\\r\\nhesitating whether to go or not. But nothing would have turned him back:\\r\\nhis decision was taken.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Besides, it doesn’t matter, they still know nothing,” he thought, “and\\r\\nthey are used to thinking of me as eccentric.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was appallingly dressed: his clothes torn and dirty, soaked with a\\r\\nnight’s rain. His face was almost distorted from fatigue, exposure, the\\r\\ninward conflict that had lasted for twenty-four hours. He had spent all\\r\\nthe previous night alone, God knows where. But anyway he had reached a\\r\\ndecision.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knocked at the door which was opened by his mother. Dounia was not\\r\\nat home. Even the servant happened to be out. At first Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna was speechless with joy and surprise; then she took him by\\r\\nthe hand and drew him into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here you are!” she began, faltering with joy. “Don’t be angry with\\r\\nme, Rodya, for welcoming you so foolishly with tears: I am laughing not\\r\\ncrying. Did you think I was crying? No, I am delighted, but I’ve got\\r\\ninto such a stupid habit of shedding tears. I’ve been like that ever\\r\\nsince your father’s death. I cry for anything. Sit down, dear boy, you\\r\\nmust be tired; I see you are. Ah, how muddy you are.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was in the rain yesterday, mother....” Raskolnikov began.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly interrupted, “you thought I\\r\\nwas going to cross-question you in the womanish way I used to; don’t be\\r\\nanxious, I understand, I understand it all: now I’ve learned the ways\\r\\nhere and truly I see for myself that they are better. I’ve made up my\\r\\nmind once for all: how could I understand your plans and expect you to\\r\\ngive an account of them? God knows what concerns and plans you may have,\\r\\nor what ideas you are hatching; so it’s not for me to keep nudging your\\r\\nelbow, asking you what you are thinking about? But, my goodness! why\\r\\nam I running to and fro as though I were crazy...? I am reading your\\r\\narticle in the magazine for the third time, Rodya. Dmitri Prokofitch\\r\\nbrought it to me. Directly I saw it I cried out to myself: ‘There,\\r\\nfoolish one,’ I thought, ‘that’s what he is busy about; that’s the\\r\\nsolution of the mystery! Learned people are always like that. He may\\r\\nhave some new ideas in his head just now; he is thinking them over and I\\r\\nworry him and upset him.’ I read it, my dear, and of course there was a\\r\\ngreat deal I did not understand; but that’s only natural--how should I?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Show me, mother.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov took the magazine and glanced at his article. Incongruous\\r\\nas it was with his mood and his circumstances, he felt that strange and\\r\\nbitter sweet sensation that every author experiences the first time he\\r\\nsees himself in print; besides, he was only twenty-three. It lasted only\\r\\na moment. After reading a few lines he frowned and his heart throbbed\\r\\nwith anguish. He recalled all the inward conflict of the preceding\\r\\nmonths. He flung the article on the table with disgust and anger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But, however foolish I may be, Rodya, I can see for myself that you\\r\\nwill very soon be one of the leading--if not the leading man--in the\\r\\nworld of Russian thought. And they dared to think you were mad! You\\r\\ndon’t know, but they really thought that. Ah, the despicable creatures,\\r\\nhow could they understand genius! And Dounia, Dounia was all but\\r\\nbelieving it--what do you say to that? Your father sent twice to\\r\\nmagazines--the first time poems (I’ve got the manuscript and will show\\r\\nyou) and the second time a whole novel (I begged him to let me copy it\\r\\nout) and how we prayed that they should be taken--they weren’t! I was\\r\\nbreaking my heart, Rodya, six or seven days ago over your food and your\\r\\nclothes and the way you are living. But now I see again how foolish\\r\\nI was, for you can attain any position you like by your intellect and\\r\\ntalent. No doubt you don’t care about that for the present and you are\\r\\noccupied with much more important matters....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dounia’s not at home, mother?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, Rodya. I often don’t see her; she leaves me alone. Dmitri\\r\\nProkofitch comes to see me, it’s so good of him, and he always talks\\r\\nabout you. He loves you and respects you, my dear. I don’t say that\\r\\nDounia is very wanting in consideration. I am not complaining. She has\\r\\nher ways and I have mine; she seems to have got some secrets of late and\\r\\nI never have any secrets from you two. Of course, I am sure that Dounia\\r\\nhas far too much sense, and besides she loves you and me... but I don’t\\r\\nknow what it will all lead to. You’ve made me so happy by coming now,\\r\\nRodya, but she has missed you by going out; when she comes in I’ll tell\\r\\nher: ‘Your brother came in while you were out. Where have you been all\\r\\nthis time?’ You mustn’t spoil me, Rodya, you know; come when you can,\\r\\nbut if you can’t, it doesn’t matter, I can wait. I shall know, anyway,\\r\\nthat you are fond of me, that will be enough for me. I shall read what\\r\\nyou write, I shall hear about you from everyone, and sometimes you’ll\\r\\ncome yourself to see me. What could be better? Here you’ve come now to\\r\\ncomfort your mother, I see that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here I am again! Don’t mind my foolishness. My goodness, why am I\\r\\nsitting here?” she cried, jumping up. “There is coffee and I don’t offer\\r\\nyou any. Ah, that’s the selfishness of old age. I’ll get it at once!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mother, don’t trouble, I am going at once. I haven’t come for that.\\r\\nPlease listen to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna went up to him timidly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mother, whatever happens, whatever you hear about me, whatever you are\\r\\ntold about me, will you always love me as you do now?” he asked suddenly\\r\\nfrom the fullness of his heart, as though not thinking of his words and\\r\\nnot weighing them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rodya, Rodya, what is the matter? How can you ask me such a question?\\r\\nWhy, who will tell me anything about you? Besides, I shouldn’t believe\\r\\nanyone, I should refuse to listen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve come to assure you that I’ve always loved you and I am glad\\r\\nthat we are alone, even glad Dounia is out,” he went on with the same\\r\\nimpulse. “I have come to tell you that though you will be unhappy, you\\r\\nmust believe that your son loves you now more than himself, and that all\\r\\nyou thought about me, that I was cruel and didn’t care about you, was\\r\\nall a mistake. I shall never cease to love you.... Well, that’s enough:\\r\\nI thought I must do this and begin with this....”\\r\\n\\r\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna embraced him in silence, pressing him to her\\r\\nbosom and weeping gently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know what is wrong with you, Rodya,” she said at last. “I’ve\\r\\nbeen thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now I see\\r\\nthat there is a great sorrow in store for you, and that’s why you are\\r\\nmiserable. I’ve foreseen it a long time, Rodya. Forgive me for speaking\\r\\nabout it. I keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights. Your sister\\r\\nlay talking in her sleep all last night, talking of nothing but you. I\\r\\ncaught something, but I couldn’t make it out. I felt all the morning\\r\\nas though I were going to be hanged, waiting for something, expecting\\r\\nsomething, and now it has come! Rodya, Rodya, where are you going? You\\r\\nare going away somewhere?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s what I thought! I can come with you, you know, if you need\\r\\nme. And Dounia, too; she loves you, she loves you dearly--and Sofya\\r\\nSemyonovna may come with us if you like. You see, I am glad to look upon\\r\\nher as a daughter even... Dmitri Prokofitch will help us to go together.\\r\\nBut... where... are you going?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-bye, mother.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What, to-day?” she cried, as though losing him for ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t stay, I must go now....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And can’t I come with you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, but kneel down and pray to God for me. Your prayer perhaps will\\r\\nreach Him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me bless you and sign you with the cross. That’s right, that’s\\r\\nright. Oh, God, what are we doing?”\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, he was glad, he was very glad that there was no one there, that\\r\\nhe was alone with his mother. For the first time after all those awful\\r\\nmonths his heart was softened. He fell down before her, he kissed her\\r\\nfeet and both wept, embracing. And she was not surprised and did not\\r\\nquestion him this time. For some days she had realised that something\\r\\nawful was happening to her son and that now some terrible minute had\\r\\ncome for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rodya, my darling, my first born,” she said sobbing, “now you are just\\r\\nas when you were little. You would run like this to me and hug me and\\r\\nkiss me. When your father was living and we were poor, you comforted us\\r\\nsimply by being with us and when I buried your father, how often we\\r\\nwept together at his grave and embraced, as now. And if I’ve been crying\\r\\nlately, it’s that my mother’s heart had a foreboding of trouble. The\\r\\nfirst time I saw you, that evening, you remember, as soon as we arrived\\r\\nhere, I guessed simply from your eyes. My heart sank at once, and to-day\\r\\nwhen I opened the door and looked at you, I thought the fatal hour had\\r\\ncome. Rodya, Rodya, you are not going away to-day?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll come again?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes... I’ll come.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rodya, don’t be angry, I don’t dare to question you. I know I mustn’t.\\r\\nOnly say two words to me--is it far where you are going?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very far.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is awaiting you there? Some post or career for you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What God sends... only pray for me.” Raskolnikov went to the door, but\\r\\nshe clutched him and gazed despairingly into his eyes. Her face worked\\r\\nwith terror.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Enough, mother,” said Raskolnikov, deeply regretting that he had come.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not for ever, it’s not yet for ever? You’ll come, you’ll come\\r\\nto-morrow?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will, I will, good-bye.” He tore himself away at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a warm, fresh, bright evening; it had cleared up in the morning.\\r\\nRaskolnikov went to his lodgings; he made haste. He wanted to finish all\\r\\nbefore sunset. He did not want to meet anyone till then. Going up the\\r\\nstairs he noticed that Nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him\\r\\nintently. “Can anyone have come to see me?” he wondered. He had a\\r\\ndisgusted vision of Porfiry. But opening his door he saw Dounia. She\\r\\nwas sitting alone, plunged in deep thought, and looked as though she had\\r\\nbeen waiting a long time. He stopped short in the doorway. She rose from\\r\\nthe sofa in dismay and stood up facing him. Her eyes, fixed upon him,\\r\\nbetrayed horror and infinite grief. And from those eyes alone he saw at\\r\\nonce that she knew.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Am I to come in or go away?” he asked uncertainly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve been all day with Sofya Semyonovna. We were both waiting for you.\\r\\nWe thought that you would be sure to come there.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I feel weak, Dounia, I am very tired; and I should have liked at this\\r\\nmoment to be able to control myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced at her mistrustfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where were you all night?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t remember clearly. You see, sister, I wanted to make up my mind\\r\\nonce for all, and several times I walked by the Neva, I remember that\\r\\nI wanted to end it all there, but... I couldn’t make up my mind,” he\\r\\nwhispered, looking at her mistrustfully again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank God! That was just what we were afraid of, Sofya Semyonovna and\\r\\nI. Then you still have faith in life? Thank God, thank God!”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov smiled bitterly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I haven’t faith, but I have just been weeping in mother’s arms; I\\r\\nhaven’t faith, but I have just asked her to pray for me. I don’t know\\r\\nhow it is, Dounia, I don’t understand it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you been at mother’s? Have you told her?” cried Dounia,\\r\\nhorror-stricken. “Surely you haven’t done that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I didn’t tell her... in words; but she understood a great deal.\\r\\nShe heard you talking in your sleep. I am sure she half understands it\\r\\nalready. Perhaps I did wrong in going to see her. I don’t know why I did\\r\\ngo. I am a contemptible person, Dounia.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A contemptible person, but ready to face suffering! You are, aren’t\\r\\nyou?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I am going. At once. Yes, to escape the disgrace I thought of\\r\\ndrowning myself, Dounia, but as I looked into the water, I thought that\\r\\nif I had considered myself strong till now I’d better not be afraid of\\r\\ndisgrace,” he said, hurrying on. “It’s pride, Dounia.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pride, Rodya.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes; he seemed to be glad\\r\\nto think that he was still proud.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t think, sister, that I was simply afraid of the water?” he\\r\\nasked, looking into her face with a sinister smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Rodya, hush!” cried Dounia bitterly. Silence lasted for two\\r\\nminutes. He sat with his eyes fixed on the floor; Dounia stood at the\\r\\nother end of the table and looked at him with anguish. Suddenly he got\\r\\nup.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s late, it’s time to go! I am going at once to give myself up. But I\\r\\ndon’t know why I am going to give myself up.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBig tears fell down her cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are crying, sister, but can you hold out your hand to me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You doubted it?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe threw her arms round him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Aren’t you half expiating your crime by facing the suffering?” she\\r\\ncried, holding him close and kissing him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Crime? What crime?” he cried in sudden fury. “That I killed a vile\\r\\nnoxious insect, an old pawnbroker woman, of use to no one!... Killing\\r\\nher was atonement for forty sins. She was sucking the life out of poor\\r\\npeople. Was that a crime? I am not thinking of it and I am not thinking\\r\\nof expiating it, and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides? ‘A\\r\\ncrime! a crime!’ Only now I see clearly the imbecility of my cowardice,\\r\\nnow that I have decided to face this superfluous disgrace. It’s simply\\r\\nbecause I am contemptible and have nothing in me that I have decided to,\\r\\nperhaps too for my advantage, as that... Porfiry... suggested!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Brother, brother, what are you saying? Why, you have shed blood?” cried\\r\\nDounia in despair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Which all men shed,” he put in almost frantically, “which flows and has\\r\\nalways flowed in streams, which is spilt like champagne, and for which\\r\\nmen are crowned in the Capitol and are called afterwards benefactors of\\r\\nmankind. Look into it more carefully and understand it! I too wanted to\\r\\ndo good to men and would have done hundreds, thousands of good deeds\\r\\nto make up for that one piece of stupidity, not stupidity even, simply\\r\\nclumsiness, for the idea was by no means so stupid as it seems now\\r\\nthat it has failed.... (Everything seems stupid when it fails.) By that\\r\\nstupidity I only wanted to put myself into an independent position, to\\r\\ntake the first step, to obtain means, and then everything would have\\r\\nbeen smoothed over by benefits immeasurable in comparison.... But I...\\r\\nI couldn’t carry out even the first step, because I am contemptible,\\r\\nthat’s what’s the matter! And yet I won’t look at it as you do. If I had\\r\\nsucceeded I should have been crowned with glory, but now I’m trapped.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But that’s not so, not so! Brother, what are you saying?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, it’s not picturesque, not æsthetically attractive! I fail to\\r\\nunderstand why bombarding people by regular siege is more honourable.\\r\\nThe fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence. I’ve never,\\r\\nnever recognised this more clearly than now, and I am further than ever\\r\\nfrom seeing that what I did was a crime. I’ve never, never been stronger\\r\\nand more convinced than now.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colour had rushed into his pale exhausted face, but as he uttered\\r\\nhis last explanation, he happened to meet Dounia’s eyes and he saw such\\r\\nanguish in them that he could not help being checked. He felt that he\\r\\nhad, anyway, made these two poor women miserable, that he was, anyway,\\r\\nthe cause...\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dounia darling, if I am guilty forgive me (though I cannot be forgiven\\r\\nif I am guilty). Good-bye! We won’t dispute. It’s time, high time to go.\\r\\nDon’t follow me, I beseech you, I have somewhere else to go.... But you\\r\\ngo at once and sit with mother. I entreat you to! It’s my last request\\r\\nof you. Don’t leave her at all; I left her in a state of anxiety, that\\r\\nshe is not fit to bear; she will die or go out of her mind. Be with\\r\\nher! Razumihin will be with you. I’ve been talking to him.... Don’t cry\\r\\nabout me: I’ll try to be honest and manly all my life, even if I am a\\r\\nmurderer. Perhaps I shall some day make a name. I won’t disgrace you,\\r\\nyou will see; I’ll still show.... Now good-bye for the present,” he\\r\\nconcluded hurriedly, noticing again a strange expression in Dounia’s\\r\\neyes at his last words and promises. “Why are you crying? Don’t cry,\\r\\ndon’t cry: we are not parting for ever! Ah, yes! Wait a minute, I’d\\r\\nforgotten!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went to the table, took up a thick dusty book, opened it and took\\r\\nfrom between the pages a little water-colour portrait on ivory. It was\\r\\nthe portrait of his landlady’s daughter, who had died of fever, that\\r\\nstrange girl who had wanted to be a nun. For a minute he gazed at the\\r\\ndelicate expressive face of his betrothed, kissed the portrait and gave\\r\\nit to Dounia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I used to talk a great deal about it to her, only to her,” he said\\r\\nthoughtfully. “To her heart I confided much of what has since been so\\r\\nhideously realised. Don’t be uneasy,” he returned to Dounia, “she was\\r\\nas much opposed to it as you, and I am glad that she is gone. The great\\r\\npoint is that everything now is going to be different, is going to\\r\\nbe broken in two,” he cried, suddenly returning to his dejection.\\r\\n“Everything, everything, and am I prepared for it? Do I want it myself?\\r\\nThey say it is necessary for me to suffer! What’s the object of these\\r\\nsenseless sufferings? shall I know any better what they are for, when I\\r\\nam crushed by hardships and idiocy, and weak as an old man after twenty\\r\\nyears’ penal servitude? And what shall I have to live for then? Why am I\\r\\nconsenting to that life now? Oh, I knew I was contemptible when I stood\\r\\nlooking at the Neva at daybreak to-day!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last they both went out. It was hard for Dounia, but she loved him.\\r\\nShe walked away, but after going fifty paces she turned round to look\\r\\nat him again. He was still in sight. At the corner he too turned and for\\r\\nthe last time their eyes met; but noticing that she was looking at him,\\r\\nhe motioned her away with impatience and even vexation, and turned the\\r\\ncorner abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am wicked, I see that,” he thought to himself, feeling ashamed a\\r\\nmoment later of his angry gesture to Dounia. “But why are they so fond\\r\\nof me if I don’t deserve it? Oh, if only I were alone and no one loved\\r\\nme and I too had never loved anyone! _Nothing of all this would have\\r\\nhappened._ But I wonder shall I in those fifteen or twenty years grow so\\r\\nmeek that I shall humble myself before people and whimper at every word\\r\\nthat I am a criminal? Yes, that’s it, that’s it, that’s what they are\\r\\nsending me there for, that’s what they want. Look at them running to and\\r\\nfro about the streets, every one of them a scoundrel and a criminal at\\r\\nheart and, worse still, an idiot. But try to get me off and they’d be\\r\\nwild with righteous indignation. Oh, how I hate them all!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe fell to musing by what process it could come to pass, that he could\\r\\nbe humbled before all of them, indiscriminately--humbled by conviction.\\r\\nAnd yet why not? It must be so. Would not twenty years of continual\\r\\nbondage crush him utterly? Water wears out a stone. And why, why should\\r\\nhe live after that? Why should he go now when he knew that it would be\\r\\nso? It was the hundredth time perhaps that he had asked himself that\\r\\nquestion since the previous evening, but still he went.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he went into Sonia’s room, it was already getting dark. All day\\r\\nSonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety. Dounia had been\\r\\nwaiting with her. She had come to her that morning, remembering\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov’s words that Sonia knew. We will not describe the\\r\\nconversation and tears of the two girls, and how friendly they became.\\r\\nDounia gained one comfort at least from that interview, that her\\r\\nbrother would not be alone. He had gone to her, Sonia, first with his\\r\\nconfession; he had gone to her for human fellowship when he needed it;\\r\\nshe would go with him wherever fate might send him. Dounia did not ask,\\r\\nbut she knew it was so. She looked at Sonia almost with reverence and\\r\\nat first almost embarrassed her by it. Sonia was almost on the point\\r\\nof tears. She felt herself, on the contrary, hardly worthy to look at\\r\\nDounia. Dounia’s gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively\\r\\nand respectfully at their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room had\\r\\nremained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life.\\r\\n\\r\\nDounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went to her\\r\\nbrother’s room to await him there; she kept thinking that he would come\\r\\nthere first. When she had gone, Sonia began to be tortured by the dread\\r\\nof his committing suicide, and Dounia too feared it. But they had spent\\r\\nthe day trying to persuade each other that that could not be, and both\\r\\nwere less anxious while they were together. As soon as they parted, each\\r\\nthought of nothing else. Sonia remembered how Svidrigaïlov had said to\\r\\nher the day before that Raskolnikov had two alternatives--Siberia or...\\r\\nBesides she knew his vanity, his pride and his lack of faith.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to\\r\\nmake him live?” she thought at last in despair.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the sun was setting. Sonia was standing in dejection, looking\\r\\nintently out of the window, but from it she could see nothing but the\\r\\nunwhitewashed blank wall of the next house. At last when she began to\\r\\nfeel sure of his death--he walked into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face she turned\\r\\npale.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Raskolnikov, smiling. “I have come for your cross, Sonia. It\\r\\nwas you told me to go to the cross-roads; why is it you are frightened\\r\\nnow it’s come to that?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia gazed at him astonished. His tone seemed strange to her; a cold\\r\\nshiver ran over her, but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the\\r\\nwords were a mask. He spoke to her looking away, as though to avoid\\r\\nmeeting her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You see, Sonia, I’ve decided that it will be better so. There is one\\r\\nfact.... But it’s a long story and there’s no need to discuss it. But\\r\\ndo you know what angers me? It annoys me that all those stupid brutish\\r\\nfaces will be gaping at me directly, pestering me with their stupid\\r\\nquestions, which I shall have to answer--they’ll point their fingers at\\r\\nme.... Tfoo! You know I am not going to Porfiry, I am sick of him. I’d\\r\\nrather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how I shall surprise\\r\\nhim, what a sensation I shall make! But I must be cooler; I’ve become\\r\\ntoo irritable of late. You know I was nearly shaking my fist at my\\r\\nsister just now, because she turned to take a last look at me. It’s\\r\\na brutal state to be in! Ah! what am I coming to! Well, where are the\\r\\ncrosses?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed hardly to know what he was doing. He could not stay still or\\r\\nconcentrate his attention on anything; his ideas seemed to gallop after\\r\\none another, he talked incoherently, his hands trembled slightly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, one of cypress\\r\\nwood and one of copper. She made the sign of the cross over herself and\\r\\nover him, and put the wooden cross on his neck.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s the symbol of my taking up the cross,” he laughed. “As though I\\r\\nhad not suffered much till now! The wooden cross, that is the peasant\\r\\none; the copper one, that is Lizaveta’s--you will wear yourself, show\\r\\nme! So she had it on... at that moment? I remember two things like\\r\\nthese too, a silver one and a little ikon. I threw them back on the old\\r\\nwoman’s neck. Those would be appropriate now, really, those are what I\\r\\nought to put on now.... But I am talking nonsense and forgetting what\\r\\nmatters; I’m somehow forgetful.... You see I have come to warn you,\\r\\nSonia, so that you might know... that’s all--that’s all I came for. But\\r\\nI thought I had more to say. You wanted me to go yourself. Well, now I\\r\\nam going to prison and you’ll have your wish. Well, what are you crying\\r\\nfor? You too? Don’t. Leave off! Oh, how I hate it all!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked at her. “Why\\r\\nis she grieving too?” he thought to himself. “What am I to her? Why does\\r\\nshe weep? Why is she looking after me, like my mother or Dounia? She’ll\\r\\nbe my nurse.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Cross yourself, say at least one prayer,” Sonia begged in a timid\\r\\nbroken voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh certainly, as much as you like! And sincerely, Sonia, sincerely....”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he wanted to say something quite different.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe crossed himself several times. Sonia took up her shawl and put\\r\\nit over her head. It was the green _drap de dames_ shawl of which\\r\\nMarmeladov had spoken, “the family shawl.” Raskolnikov thought of that\\r\\nlooking at it, but he did not ask. He began to feel himself that he\\r\\nwas certainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated. He was\\r\\nfrightened at this. He was suddenly struck too by the thought that Sonia\\r\\nmeant to go with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, stay! I’ll go\\r\\nalone,” he cried in cowardly vexation, and almost resentful, he moved\\r\\ntowards the door. “What’s the use of going in procession?” he muttered\\r\\ngoing out.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia remained standing in the middle of the room. He had not even said\\r\\ngood-bye to her; he had forgotten her. A poignant and rebellious doubt\\r\\nsurged in his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was it right, was it right, all this?” he thought again as he went down\\r\\nthe stairs. “Couldn’t he stop and retract it all... and not go?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut still he went. He felt suddenly once for all that he mustn’t ask\\r\\nhimself questions. As he turned into the street he remembered that he\\r\\nhad not said good-bye to Sonia, that he had left her in the middle of\\r\\nthe room in her green shawl, not daring to stir after he had shouted\\r\\nat her, and he stopped short for a moment. At the same instant, another\\r\\nthought dawned upon him, as though it had been lying in wait to strike\\r\\nhim then.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, with what object did I go to her just now? I told her--on\\r\\nbusiness; on what business? I had no sort of business! To tell her I was\\r\\n_going_; but where was the need? Do I love her? No, no, I drove her away\\r\\njust now like a dog. Did I want her crosses? Oh, how low I’ve sunk! No,\\r\\nI wanted her tears, I wanted to see her terror, to see how her heart\\r\\nached! I had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, some\\r\\nfriendly face to see! And I dared to believe in myself, to dream of what\\r\\nI would do! I am a beggarly contemptible wretch, contemptible!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked along the canal bank, and he had not much further to go. But\\r\\non reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it\\r\\nwent to the Hay Market.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at every object and\\r\\ncould not fix his attention on anything; everything slipped away. “In\\r\\nanother week, another month I shall be driven in a prison van over this\\r\\nbridge, how shall I look at the canal then? I should like to remember\\r\\nthis!” slipped into his mind. “Look at this sign! How shall I read those\\r\\nletters then? It’s written here ‘Campany,’ that’s a thing to remember,\\r\\nthat letter _a_, and to look at it again in a month--how shall I look\\r\\nat it then? What shall I be feeling and thinking then?... How trivial\\r\\nit all must be, what I am fretting about now! Of course it must all be\\r\\ninteresting... in its way... (Ha-ha-ha! What am I thinking about?) I am\\r\\nbecoming a baby, I am showing off to myself; why am I ashamed? Foo! how\\r\\npeople shove! that fat man--a German he must be--who pushed against\\r\\nme, does he know whom he pushed? There’s a peasant woman with a baby,\\r\\nbegging. It’s curious that she thinks me happier than she is. I might\\r\\ngive her something, for the incongruity of it. Here’s a five copeck\\r\\npiece left in my pocket, where did I get it? Here, here... take it, my\\r\\ngood woman!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“God bless you,” the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went into the Hay Market. It was distasteful, very distasteful to be\\r\\nin a crowd, but he walked just where he saw most people. He would have\\r\\ngiven anything in the world to be alone; but he knew himself that he\\r\\nwould not have remained alone for a moment. There was a man drunk and\\r\\ndisorderly in the crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling down. There\\r\\nwas a ring round him. Raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd,\\r\\nstared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short\\r\\njerky laugh. A minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him,\\r\\nthough he still stared. He moved away at last, not remembering where he\\r\\nwas; but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly\\r\\ncame over him, overwhelming him body and mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe suddenly recalled Sonia’s words, “Go to the cross-roads, bow down to\\r\\nthe people, kiss the earth, for you have sinned against it too, and say\\r\\naloud to the whole world, ‘I am a murderer.’” He trembled, remembering\\r\\nthat. And the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especially\\r\\nof the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively\\r\\nclutched at the chance of this new unmixed, complete sensation. It came\\r\\nover him like a fit; it was like a single spark kindled in his soul and\\r\\nspreading fire through him. Everything in him softened at once and the\\r\\ntears started into his eyes. He fell to the earth on the spot....\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down to the earth, and\\r\\nkissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture. He got up and bowed\\r\\ndown a second time.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s boozed,” a youth near him observed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a roar of laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s going to Jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye to his children\\r\\nand his country. He’s bowing down to all the world and kissing the great\\r\\ncity of St. Petersburg and its pavement,” added a workman who was a\\r\\nlittle drunk.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite a young man, too!” observed a third.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And a gentleman,” someone observed soberly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s no knowing who’s a gentleman and who isn’t nowadays.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThese exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, and the words, “I am\\r\\na murderer,” which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lips,\\r\\ndied away. He bore these remarks quietly, however, and, without looking\\r\\nround, he turned down a street leading to the police office. He had a\\r\\nglimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him; he had felt\\r\\nthat it must be so. The second time he bowed down in the Hay Market he\\r\\nsaw, standing fifty paces from him on the left, Sonia. She was hiding\\r\\nfrom him behind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place. She had\\r\\nfollowed him then on his painful way! Raskolnikov at that moment felt\\r\\nand knew once for all that Sonia was with him for ever and would follow\\r\\nhim to the ends of the earth, wherever fate might take him. It wrung his\\r\\nheart... but he was just reaching the fatal place.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went into the yard fairly resolutely. He had to mount to the third\\r\\nstorey. “I shall be some time going up,” he thought. He felt as though\\r\\nthe fateful moment was still far off, as though he had plenty of time\\r\\nleft for consideration.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about on the spiral\\r\\nstairs, again the open doors of the flats, again the same kitchens and\\r\\nthe same fumes and stench coming from them. Raskolnikov had not been\\r\\nhere since that day. His legs were numb and gave way under him, but\\r\\nstill they moved forward. He stopped for a moment to take breath, to\\r\\ncollect himself, so as to enter _like a man_. “But why? what for?” he\\r\\nwondered, reflecting. “If I must drink the cup what difference does it\\r\\nmake? The more revolting the better.” He imagined for an instant the\\r\\nfigure of the “explosive lieutenant,” Ilya Petrovitch. Was he actually\\r\\ngoing to him? Couldn’t he go to someone else? To Nikodim Fomitch?\\r\\nCouldn’t he turn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch’s lodgings?\\r\\nAt least then it would be done privately.... No, no! To the “explosive\\r\\nlieutenant”! If he must drink it, drink it off at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door of the office.\\r\\nThere were very few people in it this time--only a house porter and a\\r\\npeasant. The doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen.\\r\\nRaskolnikov walked into the next room. “Perhaps I still need not speak,”\\r\\n passed through his mind. Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was\\r\\nsettling himself at a bureau to write. In a corner another clerk was\\r\\nseating himself. Zametov was not there, nor, of course, Nikodim Fomitch.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No one in?” Raskolnikov asked, addressing the person at the bureau.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Whom do you want?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A-ah! Not a sound was heard, not a sight was seen, but I scent the\\r\\nRussian... how does it go on in the fairy tale... I’ve forgotten! ‘At\\r\\nyour service!’” a familiar voice cried suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov shuddered. The Explosive Lieutenant stood before him. He\\r\\nhad just come in from the third room. “It is the hand of fate,” thought\\r\\nRaskolnikov. “Why is he here?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ve come to see us? What about?” cried Ilya Petrovitch. He\\r\\nwas obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle\\r\\nexhilarated. “If it’s on business you are rather early.[*] It’s only a\\r\\nchance that I am here... however I’ll do what I can. I must admit, I...\\r\\nwhat is it, what is it? Excuse me....”\\r\\n\\r\\n     [*] Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after\\r\\n     sunset, and that the last time Raskolnikov visited the\\r\\n     police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for\\r\\n     coming too late.--TRANSLATOR.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Raskolnikov.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course, Raskolnikov. You didn’t imagine I’d forgotten? Don’t think I\\r\\nam like that... Rodion Ro--Ro--Rodionovitch, that’s it, isn’t it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rodion Romanovitch.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes, of course, Rodion Romanovitch! I was just getting at it. I\\r\\nmade many inquiries about you. I assure you I’ve been genuinely grieved\\r\\nsince that... since I behaved like that... it was explained to me\\r\\nafterwards that you were a literary man... and a learned one too... and\\r\\nso to say the first steps... Mercy on us! What literary or scientific\\r\\nman does not begin by some originality of conduct! My wife and I have\\r\\nthe greatest respect for literature, in my wife it’s a genuine passion!\\r\\nLiterature and art! If only a man is a gentleman, all the rest can be\\r\\ngained by talents, learning, good sense, genius. As for a hat--well,\\r\\nwhat does a hat matter? I can buy a hat as easily as I can a bun; but\\r\\nwhat’s under the hat, what the hat covers, I can’t buy that! I was even\\r\\nmeaning to come and apologise to you, but thought maybe you’d... But I\\r\\nam forgetting to ask you, is there anything you want really? I hear your\\r\\nfamily have come?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, my mother and sister.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve even had the honour and happiness of meeting your sister--a highly\\r\\ncultivated and charming person. I confess I was sorry I got so hot with\\r\\nyou. There it is! But as for my looking suspiciously at your fainting\\r\\nfit--that affair has been cleared up splendidly! Bigotry and fanaticism!\\r\\nI understand your indignation. Perhaps you are changing your lodging on\\r\\naccount of your family’s arriving?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I only looked in... I came to ask... I thought that I should find\\r\\nZametov here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes! Of course, you’ve made friends, I heard. Well, no, Zametov is\\r\\nnot here. Yes, we’ve lost Zametov. He’s not been here since yesterday...\\r\\nhe quarrelled with everyone on leaving... in the rudest way. He is a\\r\\nfeather-headed youngster, that’s all; one might have expected something\\r\\nfrom him, but there, you know what they are, our brilliant young men.\\r\\nHe wanted to go in for some examination, but it’s only to talk and\\r\\nboast about it, it will go no further than that. Of course it’s a very\\r\\ndifferent matter with you or Mr. Razumihin there, your friend. Your\\r\\ncareer is an intellectual one and you won’t be deterred by failure. For\\r\\nyou, one may say, all the attractions of life _nihil est_--you are an\\r\\nascetic, a monk, a hermit!... A book, a pen behind your ear, a learned\\r\\nresearch--that’s where your spirit soars! I am the same way myself....\\r\\nHave you read Livingstone’s Travels?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I have. There are a great many Nihilists about nowadays, you know,\\r\\nand indeed it is not to be wondered at. What sort of days are they? I\\r\\nask you. But we thought... you are not a Nihilist of course? Answer me\\r\\nopenly, openly!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“N-no...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Believe me, you can speak openly to me as you would to yourself!\\r\\nOfficial duty is one thing but... you are thinking I meant to say\\r\\n_friendship_ is quite another? No, you’re wrong! It’s not friendship,\\r\\nbut the feeling of a man and a citizen, the feeling of humanity and of\\r\\nlove for the Almighty. I may be an official, but I am always bound\\r\\nto feel myself a man and a citizen.... You were asking about Zametov.\\r\\nZametov will make a scandal in the French style in a house of bad\\r\\nreputation, over a glass of champagne... that’s all your Zametov is good\\r\\nfor! While I’m perhaps, so to speak, burning with devotion and lofty\\r\\nfeelings, and besides I have rank, consequence, a post! I am married and\\r\\nhave children, I fulfil the duties of a man and a citizen, but who is\\r\\nhe, may I ask? I appeal to you as a man ennobled by education... Then\\r\\nthese midwives, too, have become extraordinarily numerous.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov raised his eyebrows inquiringly. The words of Ilya\\r\\nPetrovitch, who had obviously been dining, were for the most part a\\r\\nstream of empty sounds for him. But some of them he understood. He\\r\\nlooked at him inquiringly, not knowing how it would end.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I mean those crop-headed wenches,” the talkative Ilya Petrovitch\\r\\ncontinued. “Midwives is my name for them. I think it a very satisfactory\\r\\none, ha-ha! They go to the Academy, study anatomy. If I fall ill, am\\r\\nI to send for a young lady to treat me? What do you say? Ha-ha!” Ilya\\r\\nPetrovitch laughed, quite pleased with his own wit. “It’s an immoderate\\r\\nzeal for education, but once you’re educated, that’s enough. Why abuse\\r\\nit? Why insult honourable people, as that scoundrel Zametov does? Why\\r\\ndid he insult me, I ask you? Look at these suicides, too, how common\\r\\nthey are, you can’t fancy! People spend their last halfpenny and kill\\r\\nthemselves, boys and girls and old people. Only this morning we heard\\r\\nabout a gentleman who had just come to town. Nil Pavlitch, I say, what\\r\\nwas the name of that gentleman who shot himself?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Svidrigaïlov,” someone answered from the other room with drowsy\\r\\nlistlessness.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov started.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Svidrigaïlov! Svidrigaïlov has shot himself!” he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What, do you know Svidrigaïlov?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes... I knew him.... He hadn’t been here long.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, that’s so. He had lost his wife, was a man of reckless habits and\\r\\nall of a sudden shot himself, and in such a shocking way.... He left\\r\\nin his notebook a few words: that he dies in full possession of his\\r\\nfaculties and that no one is to blame for his death. He had money, they\\r\\nsay. How did you come to know him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I... was acquainted... my sister was governess in his family.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Bah-bah-bah! Then no doubt you can tell us something about him. You had\\r\\nno suspicion?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I saw him yesterday... he... was drinking wine; I knew nothing.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov felt as though something had fallen on him and was stifling\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ve turned pale again. It’s so stuffy here...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I must go,” muttered Raskolnikov. “Excuse my troubling you....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, not at all, as often as you like. It’s a pleasure to see you and I\\r\\nam glad to say so.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIlya Petrovitch held out his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I only wanted... I came to see Zametov.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I understand, I understand, and it’s a pleasure to see you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I... am very glad... good-bye,” Raskolnikov smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went out; he reeled, he was overtaken with giddiness and did not know\\r\\nwhat he was doing. He began going down the stairs, supporting himself\\r\\nwith his right hand against the wall. He fancied that a porter pushed\\r\\npast him on his way upstairs to the police office, that a dog in\\r\\nthe lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a\\r\\nrolling-pin at it and shouted. He went down and out into the yard.\\r\\nThere, not far from the entrance, stood Sonia, pale and horror-stricken.\\r\\nShe looked wildly at him. He stood still before her. There was a look of\\r\\npoignant agony, of despair, in her face. She clasped her hands. His lips\\r\\nworked in an ugly, meaningless smile. He stood still a minute, grinned\\r\\nand went back to the police office.\\r\\n\\r\\nIlya Petrovitch had sat down and was rummaging among some papers. Before\\r\\nhim stood the same peasant who had pushed by on the stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hulloa! Back again! have you left something behind? What’s the matter?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov, with white lips and staring eyes, came slowly nearer.\\r\\nHe walked right to the table, leaned his hand on it, tried to say\\r\\nsomething, but could not; only incoherent sounds were audible.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are feeling ill, a chair! Here, sit down! Some water!”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov dropped on to a chair, but he kept his eyes fixed on the\\r\\nface of Ilya Petrovitch, which expressed unpleasant surprise. Both\\r\\nlooked at one another for a minute and waited. Water was brought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was I...” began Raskolnikov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Drink some water.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov refused the water with his hand, and softly and brokenly,\\r\\nbut distinctly said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“_It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with\\r\\nan axe and robbed them._”\\r\\n\\r\\nIlya Petrovitch opened his mouth. People ran up on all sides.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov repeated his statement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEPILOGUE\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nSiberia. On the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town, one of\\r\\nthe administrative centres of Russia; in the town there is a fortress,\\r\\nin the fortress there is a prison. In the prison the second-class\\r\\nconvict Rodion Raskolnikov has been confined for nine months. Almost a\\r\\nyear and a half has passed since his crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere had been little difficulty about his trial. The criminal adhered\\r\\nexactly, firmly, and clearly to his statement. He did not confuse nor\\r\\nmisrepresent the facts, nor soften them in his own interest, nor omit\\r\\nthe smallest detail. He explained every incident of the murder, the\\r\\nsecret of _the pledge_ (the piece of wood with a strip of metal) which\\r\\nwas found in the murdered woman’s hand. He described minutely how he\\r\\nhad taken her keys, what they were like, as well as the chest and its\\r\\ncontents; he explained the mystery of Lizaveta’s murder; described how\\r\\nKoch and, after him, the student knocked, and repeated all they had said\\r\\nto one another; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay\\r\\nand Dmitri shouting; how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards\\r\\ngone home. He ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the\\r\\nVoznesensky Prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found.\\r\\nThe whole thing, in fact, was perfectly clear. The lawyers and the\\r\\njudges were very much struck, among other things, by the fact that he\\r\\nhad hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, without making\\r\\nuse of them, and that, what was more, he did not now remember what the\\r\\ntrinkets were like, or even how many there were. The fact that he had\\r\\nnever opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed\\r\\nincredible. There turned out to be in the purse three hundred and\\r\\nseventeen roubles and sixty copecks. From being so long under the stone,\\r\\nsome of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the\\r\\ndamp. They were a long while trying to discover why the accused man\\r\\nshould tell a lie about this, when about everything else he had made\\r\\na truthful and straightforward confession. Finally some of the lawyers\\r\\nmore versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really\\r\\nnot looked into the purse, and so didn’t know what was in it when he\\r\\nhid it under the stone. But they immediately drew the deduction that\\r\\nthe crime could only have been committed through temporary mental\\r\\nderangement, through homicidal mania, without object or the pursuit of\\r\\ngain. This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary\\r\\ninsanity, so often applied in our days in criminal cases. Moreover\\r\\nRaskolnikov’s hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses, by\\r\\nDr. Zossimov, his former fellow students, his landlady and her servant.\\r\\nAll this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not\\r\\nquite like an ordinary murderer and robber, but that there was another\\r\\nelement in the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion, the\\r\\ncriminal scarcely attempted to defend himself. To the decisive question\\r\\nas to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery, he\\r\\nanswered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was\\r\\nhis miserable position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire to\\r\\nprovide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand\\r\\nroubles he had reckoned on finding. He had been led to the murder\\r\\nthrough his shallow and cowardly nature, exasperated moreover by\\r\\nprivation and failure. To the question what led him to confess, he\\r\\nanswered that it was his heartfelt repentance. All this was almost\\r\\ncoarse....\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected,\\r\\nperhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself,\\r\\nbut had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt. All the strange\\r\\nand peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration.\\r\\nThere could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition\\r\\nof the criminal at the time. The fact that he had made no use of what he\\r\\nhad stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse, partly to his\\r\\nabnormal mental condition at the time of the crime. Incidentally the\\r\\nmurder of Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a man\\r\\ncommits two murders and forgets that the door is open! Finally, the\\r\\nconfession, at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by\\r\\nthe false evidence given by Nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism,\\r\\nand when, moreover, there were no proofs against the real criminal, no\\r\\nsuspicions even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word)--all this did\\r\\nmuch to soften the sentence. Other circumstances, too, in the prisoner’s\\r\\nfavour came out quite unexpectedly. Razumihin somehow discovered and\\r\\nproved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor\\r\\nconsumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting\\r\\nhim for six months, and when this student died, leaving a decrepit\\r\\nold father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year,\\r\\nRaskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral\\r\\nwhen he died. Raskolnikov’s landlady bore witness, too, that when they\\r\\nhad lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskolnikov had rescued two\\r\\nlittle children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so. This was\\r\\ninvestigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses. These facts\\r\\nmade an impression in his favour.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in the end the criminal was, in consideration of extenuating\\r\\ncircumstances, condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a\\r\\nterm of eight years only.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov’s mother fell ill. Dounia\\r\\nand Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the\\r\\ntrial. Razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from Petersburg, so\\r\\nas to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time\\r\\nto see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible. Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s\\r\\nillness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial\\r\\nderangement of her intellect.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Dounia returned from her last interview with her brother, she\\r\\nhad found her mother already ill, in feverish delirium. That evening\\r\\nRazumihin and she agreed what answers they must make to her mother’s\\r\\nquestions about Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her\\r\\nmother’s benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of Russia\\r\\non a business commission, which would bring him in the end money and\\r\\nreputation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna never\\r\\nasked them anything on the subject, neither then nor thereafter. On the\\r\\ncontrary, she had her own version of her son’s sudden departure; she\\r\\ntold them with tears how he had come to say good-bye to her, hinting\\r\\nthat she alone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that Rodya\\r\\nhad many very powerful enemies, so that it was necessary for him to be\\r\\nin hiding. As for his future career, she had no doubt that it would be\\r\\nbrilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed. She assured\\r\\nRazumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman, that his\\r\\narticle and brilliant literary talent proved it. This article she was\\r\\ncontinually reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to bed\\r\\nwith her, but scarcely asked where Rodya was, though the subject was\\r\\nobviously avoided by the others, which might have been enough to awaken\\r\\nher suspicions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s strange\\r\\nsilence on certain subjects. She did not, for instance, complain of\\r\\ngetting no letters from him, though in previous years she had only lived\\r\\non the hope of letters from her beloved Rodya. This was the cause of\\r\\ngreat uneasiness to Dounia; the idea occurred to her that her mother\\r\\nsuspected that there was something terrible in her son’s fate and was\\r\\nafraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still more awful. In any\\r\\ncase, Dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of\\r\\nher faculties.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened once or twice, however, that Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave\\r\\nsuch a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her\\r\\nwithout mentioning where Rodya was, and on receiving unsatisfactory and\\r\\nsuspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent, and this mood\\r\\nlasted for a long time. Dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive\\r\\nher and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely\\r\\nsilent on certain points; but it became more and more evident that\\r\\nthe poor mother suspected something terrible. Dounia remembered her\\r\\nbrother’s telling her that her mother had overheard her talking in her\\r\\nsleep on the night after her interview with Svidrigaïlov and before the\\r\\nfatal day of the confession: had not she made out something from that?\\r\\nSometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be\\r\\nsucceeded by a period of hysterical animation, and the invalid would\\r\\nbegin to talk almost incessantly of her son, of her hopes of his\\r\\nfuture.... Her fancies were sometimes very strange. They humoured her,\\r\\npretended to agree with her (she saw perhaps that they were pretending),\\r\\nbut she still went on talking.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive months after Raskolnikov’s confession, he was sentenced. Razumihin\\r\\nand Sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible. At last\\r\\nthe moment of separation came. Dounia swore to her brother that the\\r\\nseparation should not be for ever, Razumihin did the same. Razumihin, in\\r\\nhis youthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least\\r\\nof a secure livelihood during the next three or four years, and saving\\r\\nup a certain sum, to emigrate to Siberia, a country rich in every\\r\\nnatural resource and in need of workers, active men and capital. There\\r\\nthey would settle in the town where Rodya was and all together would\\r\\nbegin a new life. They all wept at parting.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before. He asked a great\\r\\ndeal about his mother and was constantly anxious about her. He worried\\r\\nso much about her that it alarmed Dounia. When he heard about his\\r\\nmother’s illness he became very gloomy. With Sonia he was particularly\\r\\nreserved all the time. With the help of the money left to her by\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov, Sonia had long ago made her preparations to follow the\\r\\nparty of convicts in which he was despatched to Siberia. Not a word\\r\\npassed between Raskolnikov and her on the subject, but both knew it\\r\\nwould be so. At the final leave-taking he smiled strangely at his\\r\\nsister’s and Razumihin’s fervent anticipations of their happy future\\r\\ntogether when he should come out of prison. He predicted that their\\r\\nmother’s illness would soon have a fatal ending. Sonia and he at last\\r\\nset off.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo months later Dounia was married to Razumihin. It was a quiet and\\r\\nsorrowful wedding; Porfiry Petrovitch and Zossimov were invited however.\\r\\nDuring all this period Razumihin wore an air of resolute determination.\\r\\nDounia put implicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she\\r\\ncould not but believe in him. He displayed a rare strength of will.\\r\\nAmong other things he began attending university lectures again in order\\r\\nto take his degree. They were continually making plans for the future;\\r\\nboth counted on settling in Siberia within five years at least. Till\\r\\nthen they rested their hopes on Sonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to Dounia’s\\r\\nmarriage with Razumihin; but after the marriage she became even more\\r\\nmelancholy and anxious. To give her pleasure Razumihin told her how\\r\\nRaskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father\\r\\nand how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing two\\r\\nlittle children from a fire. These two pieces of news excited Pulcheria\\r\\nAlexandrovna’s disordered imagination almost to ecstasy. She was\\r\\ncontinually talking about them, even entering into conversation with\\r\\nstrangers in the street, though Dounia always accompanied her. In public\\r\\nconveyances and shops, wherever she could capture a listener, she would\\r\\nbegin the discourse about her son, his article, how he had helped the\\r\\nstudent, how he had been burnt at the fire, and so on! Dounia did\\r\\nnot know how to restrain her. Apart from the danger of her morbid\\r\\nexcitement, there was the risk of someone’s recalling Raskolnikov’s name\\r\\nand speaking of the recent trial. Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out the\\r\\naddress of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted\\r\\non going to see her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last her restlessness reached an extreme point. She would sometimes\\r\\nbegin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious. One\\r\\nmorning she declared that by her reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home,\\r\\nthat she remembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they must\\r\\nexpect him back in nine months. She began to prepare for his coming,\\r\\nbegan to do up her room for him, to clean the furniture, to wash and\\r\\nput up new hangings and so on. Dounia was anxious, but said nothing and\\r\\nhelped her to arrange the room. After a fatiguing day spent in continual\\r\\nfancies, in joyful day-dreams and tears, Pulcheria Alexandrovna was\\r\\ntaken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious.\\r\\nIt was brain fever. She died within a fortnight. In her delirium she\\r\\ndropped words which showed that she knew a great deal more about her\\r\\nson’s terrible fate than they had supposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his mother’s death, though\\r\\na regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached\\r\\nSiberia. It was carried on by means of Sonia, who wrote every month\\r\\nto the Razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity. At\\r\\nfirst they found Sonia’s letters dry and unsatisfactory, but later on\\r\\nthey came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better, for\\r\\nfrom these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate\\r\\nbrother’s life. Sonia’s letters were full of the most matter-of-fact\\r\\ndetail, the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikov’s\\r\\nsurroundings as a convict. There was no word of her own hopes, no\\r\\nconjecture as to the future, no description of her feelings. Instead of\\r\\nany attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life, she gave the\\r\\nsimple facts--that is, his own words, an exact account of his health,\\r\\nwhat he asked for at their interviews, what commission he gave her\\r\\nand so on. All these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness. The\\r\\npicture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness\\r\\nand precision. There could be no mistake, because nothing was given but\\r\\nfacts.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news,\\r\\nespecially at first. Sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and not\\r\\nready to talk, that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave\\r\\nhim from their letters, that he sometimes asked after his mother and\\r\\nthat when, seeing that he had guessed the truth, she told him at last\\r\\nof her death, she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly\\r\\naffected by it, not externally at any rate. She told them that, although\\r\\nhe seemed so wrapped up in himself and, as it were, shut himself off\\r\\nfrom everyone--he took a very direct and simple view of his new life;\\r\\nthat he understood his position, expected nothing better for the time,\\r\\nhad no ill-founded hopes (as is so common in his position) and scarcely\\r\\nseemed surprised at anything in his surroundings, so unlike anything he\\r\\nhad known before. She wrote that his health was satisfactory; he did his\\r\\nwork without shirking or seeking to do more; he was almost indifferent\\r\\nabout food, but except on Sundays and holidays the food was so bad that\\r\\nat last he had been glad to accept some money from her, Sonia, to have\\r\\nhis own tea every day. He begged her not to trouble about anything else,\\r\\ndeclaring that all this fuss about him only annoyed him. Sonia wrote\\r\\nfurther that in prison he shared the same room with the rest, that she\\r\\nhad not seen the inside of their barracks, but concluded that they were\\r\\ncrowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he slept on a plank bed with a\\r\\nrug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement. But that\\r\\nhe lived so poorly and roughly, not from any plan or design, but simply\\r\\nfrom inattention and indifference.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits,\\r\\nhad almost been vexed with her indeed for coming, unwilling to talk and\\r\\nrude to her. But that in the end these visits had become a habit and\\r\\nalmost a necessity for him, so that he was positively distressed when\\r\\nshe was ill for some days and could not visit him. She used to see him\\r\\non holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room, to which he was\\r\\nbrought for a few minutes to see her. On working days she would go to\\r\\nsee him at work either at the workshops or at the brick kilns, or at the\\r\\nsheds on the banks of the Irtish.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout herself, Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making some\\r\\nacquaintances in the town, that she did sewing, and, as there\\r\\nwas scarcely a dressmaker in the town, she was looked upon as an\\r\\nindispensable person in many houses. But she did not mention that the\\r\\nauthorities were, through her, interested in Raskolnikov; that his task\\r\\nwas lightened and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the news came (Dounia had indeed noticed signs of alarm and\\r\\nuneasiness in the preceding letters) that he held aloof from everyone,\\r\\nthat his fellow prisoners did not like him, that he kept silent for days\\r\\nat a time and was becoming very pale. In the last letter Sonia wrote\\r\\nthat he had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of\\r\\nthe hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was ill a long time. But it was not the horrors of prison life, not\\r\\nthe hard labour, the bad food, the shaven head, or the patched clothes\\r\\nthat crushed him. What did he care for all those trials and hardships!\\r\\nhe was even glad of the hard work. Physically exhausted, he could at\\r\\nleast reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep. And what was the food to\\r\\nhim--the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it? In the past as a\\r\\nstudent he had often not had even that. His clothes were warm and suited\\r\\nto his manner of life. He did not even feel the fetters. Was he ashamed\\r\\nof his shaven head and parti-coloured coat? Before whom? Before Sonia?\\r\\nSonia was afraid of him, how could he be ashamed before her? And yet he\\r\\nwas ashamed even before Sonia, whom he tortured because of it with\\r\\nhis contemptuous rough manner. But it was not his shaven head and his\\r\\nfetters he was ashamed of: his pride had been stung to the quick. It was\\r\\nwounded pride that made him ill. Oh, how happy he would have been if he\\r\\ncould have blamed himself! He could have borne anything then, even\\r\\nshame and disgrace. But he judged himself severely, and his exasperated\\r\\nconscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past, except\\r\\na simple _blunder_ which might happen to anyone. He was ashamed just\\r\\nbecause he, Raskolnikov, had so hopelessly, stupidly come to grief\\r\\nthrough some decree of blind fate, and must humble himself and submit to\\r\\n“the idiocy” of a sentence, if he were anyhow to be at peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nVague and objectless anxiety in the present, and in the future a\\r\\ncontinual sacrifice leading to nothing--that was all that lay before\\r\\nhim. And what comfort was it to him that at the end of eight years he\\r\\nwould only be thirty-two and able to begin a new life! What had he to\\r\\nlive for? What had he to look forward to? Why should he strive? To live\\r\\nin order to exist? Why, he had been ready a thousand times before to\\r\\ngive up existence for the sake of an idea, for a hope, even for a fancy.\\r\\nMere existence had always been too little for him; he had always wanted\\r\\nmore. Perhaps it was just because of the strength of his desires that he\\r\\nhad thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than to others.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if only fate would have sent him repentance--burning repentance that\\r\\nwould have torn his heart and robbed him of sleep, that repentance, the\\r\\nawful agony of which brings visions of hanging or drowning! Oh, he would\\r\\nhave been glad of it! Tears and agonies would at least have been life.\\r\\nBut he did not repent of his crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity, as he\\r\\nhad raged at the grotesque blunders that had brought him to prison.\\r\\nBut now in prison, _in freedom_, he thought over and criticised all his\\r\\nactions again and by no means found them so blundering and so grotesque\\r\\nas they had seemed at the fatal time.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In what way,” he asked himself, “was my theory stupider than others\\r\\nthat have swarmed and clashed from the beginning of the world? One has\\r\\nonly to look at the thing quite independently, broadly, and uninfluenced\\r\\nby commonplace ideas, and my idea will by no means seem so... strange.\\r\\nOh, sceptics and halfpenny philosophers, why do you halt half-way!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why does my action strike them as so horrible?” he said to himself. “Is\\r\\nit because it was a crime? What is meant by crime? My conscience is at\\r\\nrest. Of course, it was a legal crime, of course, the letter of the law\\r\\nwas broken and blood was shed. Well, punish me for the letter of the\\r\\nlaw... and that’s enough. Of course, in that case many of the\\r\\nbenefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of\\r\\ninheriting it ought to have been punished at their first steps. But\\r\\nthose men succeeded and so _they were right_, and I didn’t, and so I\\r\\nhad no right to have taken that step.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was only in that that he recognised his criminality, only in the fact\\r\\nthat he had been unsuccessful and had confessed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe suffered too from the question: why had he not killed himself? Why\\r\\nhad he stood looking at the river and preferred to confess? Was the\\r\\ndesire to live so strong and was it so hard to overcome it? Had not\\r\\nSvidrigaïlov overcome it, although he was afraid of death?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn misery he asked himself this question, and could not understand that,\\r\\nat the very time he had been standing looking into the river, he had\\r\\nperhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and\\r\\nhis convictions. He didn’t understand that that consciousness might be\\r\\nthe promise of a future crisis, of a new view of life and of his future\\r\\nresurrection.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he\\r\\ncould not step over, again through weakness and meanness. He looked at\\r\\nhis fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and\\r\\nprized it. It seemed to him that they loved and valued life more in\\r\\nprison than in freedom. What terrible agonies and privations some of\\r\\nthem, the tramps for instance, had endured! Could they care so much for\\r\\na ray of sunshine, for the primeval forest, the cold spring hidden away\\r\\nin some unseen spot, which the tramp had marked three years before, and\\r\\nlonged to see again, as he might to see his sweetheart, dreaming of the\\r\\ngreen grass round it and the bird singing in the bush? As he went on he\\r\\nsaw still more inexplicable examples.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn prison, of course, there was a great deal he did not see and did not\\r\\nwant to see; he lived as it were with downcast eyes. It was loathsome\\r\\nand unbearable for him to look. But in the end there was much that\\r\\nsurprised him and he began, as it were involuntarily, to notice much\\r\\nthat he had not suspected before. What surprised him most of all was\\r\\nthe terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest. They\\r\\nseemed to be a different species, and he looked at them and they at\\r\\nhim with distrust and hostility. He felt and knew the reasons of his\\r\\nisolation, but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons\\r\\nwere so deep and strong. There were some Polish exiles, political\\r\\nprisoners, among them. They simply looked down upon all the rest as\\r\\nignorant churls; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them like that.\\r\\nHe saw that these ignorant men were in many respects far wiser than the\\r\\nPoles. There were some Russians who were just as contemptuous, a former\\r\\nofficer and two seminarists. Raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly.\\r\\nHe was disliked and avoided by everyone; they even began to hate him at\\r\\nlast--why, he could not tell. Men who had been far more guilty despised\\r\\nand laughed at his crime.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re a gentleman,” they used to say. “You shouldn’t hack about with\\r\\nan axe; that’s not a gentleman’s work.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second week in Lent, his turn came to take the sacrament with his\\r\\ngang. He went to church and prayed with the others. A quarrel broke out\\r\\none day, he did not know how. All fell on him at once in a fury.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re an infidel! You don’t believe in God,” they shouted. “You ought\\r\\nto be killed.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had never talked to them about God nor his belief, but they wanted to\\r\\nkill him as an infidel. He said nothing. One of the prisoners rushed at\\r\\nhim in a perfect frenzy. Raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently;\\r\\nhis eyebrows did not quiver, his face did not flinch. The guard\\r\\nsucceeded in intervening between him and his assailant, or there would\\r\\nhave been bloodshed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was another question he could not decide: why were they all so\\r\\nfond of Sonia? She did not try to win their favour; she rarely met\\r\\nthem, sometimes only she came to see him at work for a moment. And yet\\r\\neverybody knew her, they knew that she had come out to follow _him_,\\r\\nknew how and where she lived. She never gave them money, did them no\\r\\nparticular services. Only once at Christmas she sent them all presents\\r\\nof pies and rolls. But by degrees closer relations sprang up between\\r\\nthem and Sonia. She would write and post letters for them to their\\r\\nrelations. Relations of the prisoners who visited the town, at their\\r\\ninstructions, left with Sonia presents and money for them. Their wives\\r\\nand sweethearts knew her and used to visit her. And when she visited\\r\\nRaskolnikov at work, or met a party of the prisoners on the road, they\\r\\nall took off their hats to her. “Little mother Sofya Semyonovna, you\\r\\nare our dear, good little mother,” coarse branded criminals said to that\\r\\nfrail little creature. She would smile and bow to them and everyone was\\r\\ndelighted when she smiled. They even admired her gait and turned round\\r\\nto watch her walking; they admired her too for being so little, and, in\\r\\nfact, did not know what to admire her most for. They even came to her\\r\\nfor help in their illnesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was in the hospital from the middle of Lent till after Easter. When\\r\\nhe was better, he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish\\r\\nand delirious. He dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a\\r\\nterrible new strange plague that had come to Europe from the depths of\\r\\nAsia. All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen. Some new sorts\\r\\nof microbes were attacking the bodies of men, but these microbes were\\r\\nendowed with intelligence and will. Men attacked by them became at once\\r\\nmad and furious. But never had men considered themselves so intellectual\\r\\nand so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers, never\\r\\nhad they considered their decisions, their scientific conclusions, their\\r\\nmoral convictions so infallible. Whole villages, whole towns and peoples\\r\\nwent mad from the infection. All were excited and did not understand\\r\\none another. Each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched\\r\\nlooking at the others, beat himself on the breast, wept, and wrung\\r\\nhis hands. They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to\\r\\nconsider evil and what good; they did not know whom to blame, whom\\r\\nto justify. Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite. They\\r\\ngathered together in armies against one another, but even on the march\\r\\nthe armies would begin attacking each other, the ranks would be broken\\r\\nand the soldiers would fall on each other, stabbing and cutting, biting\\r\\nand devouring each other. The alarm bell was ringing all day long in\\r\\nthe towns; men rushed together, but why they were summoned and who was\\r\\nsummoning them no one knew. The most ordinary trades were abandoned,\\r\\nbecause everyone proposed his own ideas, his own improvements, and they\\r\\ncould not agree. The land too was abandoned. Men met in groups, agreed\\r\\non something, swore to keep together, but at once began on something\\r\\nquite different from what they had proposed. They accused one another,\\r\\nfought and killed each other. There were conflagrations and famine. All\\r\\nmen and all things were involved in destruction. The plague spread and\\r\\nmoved further and further. Only a few men could be saved in the whole\\r\\nworld. They were a pure chosen people, destined to found a new race and\\r\\na new life, to renew and purify the earth, but no one had seen these\\r\\nmen, no one had heard their words and their voices.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory so\\r\\nmiserably, the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long.\\r\\nThe second week after Easter had come. There were warm bright spring\\r\\ndays; in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel\\r\\npaced were opened. Sonia had only been able to visit him twice during\\r\\nhis illness; each time she had to obtain permission, and it was\\r\\ndifficult. But she often used to come to the hospital yard, especially\\r\\nin the evening, sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the\\r\\nwindows of the ward.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening, when he was almost well again, Raskolnikov fell asleep. On\\r\\nwaking up he chanced to go to the window, and at once saw Sonia in the\\r\\ndistance at the hospital gate. She seemed to be waiting for someone.\\r\\nSomething stabbed him to the heart at that minute. He shuddered and\\r\\nmoved away from the window. Next day Sonia did not come, nor the day\\r\\nafter; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily. At last he was\\r\\ndischarged. On reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that\\r\\nSofya Semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her; he soon learnt that\\r\\nher illness was not dangerous. Hearing that he was anxious about her,\\r\\nSonia sent him a pencilled note, telling him that she was much better,\\r\\nthat she had a slight cold and that she would soon, very soon come and\\r\\nsee him at his work. His heart throbbed painfully as he read it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain it was a warm bright day. Early in the morning, at six o’clock, he\\r\\nwent off to work on the river bank, where they used to pound alabaster\\r\\nand where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed. There were only\\r\\nthree of them sent. One of the convicts went with the guard to the\\r\\nfortress to fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and\\r\\nlaying it in the kiln. Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river\\r\\nbank, sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the\\r\\nwide deserted river. From the high bank a broad landscape opened before\\r\\nhim, the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank.\\r\\nIn the vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black\\r\\nspecks, the nomads’ tents. There there was freedom, there other men were\\r\\nliving, utterly unlike those here; there time itself seemed to stand\\r\\nstill, as though the age of Abraham and his flocks had not passed.\\r\\nRaskolnikov sat gazing, his thoughts passed into day-dreams, into\\r\\ncontemplation; he thought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited\\r\\nand troubled him. Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she had come up\\r\\nnoiselessly and sat down at his side. It was still quite early; the\\r\\nmorning chill was still keen. She wore her poor old burnous and the\\r\\ngreen shawl; her face still showed signs of illness, it was thinner and\\r\\npaler. She gave him a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her hand\\r\\nwith her usual timidity. She was always timid of holding out her hand\\r\\nto him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as though afraid he would\\r\\nrepel it. He always took her hand as though with repugnance, always\\r\\nseemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout\\r\\nher visit. Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply\\r\\ngrieved. But now their hands did not part. He stole a rapid glance\\r\\nat her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking. They were\\r\\nalone, no one had seen them. The guard had turned away for the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow it happened he did not know. But all at once something seemed to\\r\\nseize him and fling him at her feet. He wept and threw his arms round\\r\\nher knees. For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she\\r\\nturned pale. She jumped up and looked at him trembling. But at the same\\r\\nmoment she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her\\r\\neyes. She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and\\r\\nthat at last the moment had come....\\r\\n\\r\\nThey wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their eyes. They\\r\\nwere both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with the\\r\\ndawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life. They were\\r\\nrenewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the\\r\\nheart of the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey resolved to wait and be patient. They had another seven years to\\r\\nwait, and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before\\r\\nthem! But he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his\\r\\nbeing, while she--she only lived in his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the evening of the same day, when the barracks were locked,\\r\\nRaskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of her. He had even fancied\\r\\nthat day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him\\r\\ndifferently; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered\\r\\nhim in a friendly way. He remembered that now, and thought it was bound\\r\\nto be so. Wasn’t everything now bound to be changed?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought of her. He remembered how continually he had tormented her\\r\\nand wounded her heart. He remembered her pale and thin little face.\\r\\nBut these recollections scarcely troubled him now; he knew with what\\r\\ninfinite love he would now repay all her sufferings. And what were all,\\r\\n_all_ the agonies of the past! Everything, even his crime, his sentence\\r\\nand imprisonment, seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an\\r\\nexternal, strange fact with which he had no concern. But he could not\\r\\nthink for long together of anything that evening, and he could not have\\r\\nanalysed anything consciously; he was simply feeling. Life had stepped\\r\\ninto the place of theory and something quite different would work itself\\r\\nout in his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder his pillow lay the New Testament. He took it up mechanically.\\r\\nThe book belonged to Sonia; it was the one from which she had read the\\r\\nraising of Lazarus to him. At first he was afraid that she would worry\\r\\nhim about religion, would talk about the gospel and pester him with\\r\\nbooks. But to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject\\r\\nand had not even offered him the Testament. He had asked her for it\\r\\nhimself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without\\r\\na word. Till now he had not opened it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not open it now, but one thought passed through his mind: “Can\\r\\nher convictions not be mine now? Her feelings, her aspirations at\\r\\nleast....”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe too had been greatly agitated that day, and at night she was taken\\r\\nill again. But she was so happy--and so unexpectedly happy--that she was\\r\\nalmost frightened of her happiness. Seven years, _only_ seven years! At\\r\\nthe beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both ready\\r\\nto look on those seven years as though they were seven days. He did not\\r\\nknow that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he would\\r\\nhave to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving, great\\r\\nsuffering.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that is the beginning of a new story--the story of the gradual\\r\\nrenewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing\\r\\nfrom one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life.\\r\\nThat might be the subject of a new story, but our present story is\\r\\nended.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CRIME AND PUNISHMENT ***\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\\r\\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\r\\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\\r\\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

Far from it. As touching the\\r\\n        ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these\\r\\n        extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing\\r\\n        bird&rsquo;s eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied,\\r\\n        and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our\\r\\n        own.\\r\\n      </p>\\r\\n      <p>\\r\\n        So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am.

For by how much the more pains ye take to please the\\r\\n        world, by so much the more shall ye for ever go thankless!

Loomings.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Call me Ishmael. Some years ago&mdash;never mind how long precisely&mdash;having\\r\\n      little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on\\r\\n      shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of\\r\\n      the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the\\r\\n      circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever\\r\\n      it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself\\r\\n      involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear\\r\\n      of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an\\r\\n      upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me\\r\\n      from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking\\r\\n      people&rsquo;s hats off&mdash;then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon\\r\\n      as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical\\r\\n      flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship.\\r\\n      There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men\\r\\n      in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings\\r\\n      towards the ocean with me.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves\\r\\n      as Indian isles by coral reefs&mdash;commerce surrounds it with her surf.\\r\\n      Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is\\r\\n      the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by\\r\\n      breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the\\r\\n      crowds of water-gazers there.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears\\r\\n      Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do\\r\\n      you see?&mdash;Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand\\r\\n      thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some\\r\\n      leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking\\r\\n      over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as\\r\\n      if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all\\r\\n      landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster&mdash;tied to counters,\\r\\n      nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green\\r\\n      fields gone? What do they here?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and\\r\\n      seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the\\r\\n      extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder\\r\\n      warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as\\r\\n      they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand&mdash;miles of\\r\\n      them&mdash;leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys,\\r\\n      streets and avenues&mdash;north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all\\r\\n      unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses\\r\\n      of all those ships attract them thither?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take\\r\\n      almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale,\\r\\n      and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let\\r\\n      the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries&mdash;stand\\r\\n      that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead\\r\\n      you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be\\r\\n      athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan\\r\\n      happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one\\r\\n      knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,\\r\\n      quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of\\r\\n      the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees,\\r\\n      each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and\\r\\n      here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder\\r\\n      cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way,\\r\\n      reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue.\\r\\n      But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes\\r\\n      down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd&rsquo;s head, yet all were vain,\\r\\n      unless the shepherd&rsquo;s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go\\r\\n      visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade\\r\\n      knee-deep among Tiger-lilies&mdash;what is the one charm wanting?&mdash;Water&mdash;there\\r\\n      is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would\\r\\n      you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of\\r\\n      Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate\\r\\n      whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a\\r\\n      pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy\\r\\n      with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to\\r\\n      sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such\\r\\n      a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out\\r\\n      of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the\\r\\n      Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this\\r\\n      is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of\\r\\n      Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he\\r\\n      saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image,\\r\\n      we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the\\r\\n      ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to\\r\\n      grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do\\r\\n      not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to\\r\\n      go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag\\r\\n      unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick&mdash;grow\\r\\n      quarrelsome&mdash;don&rsquo;t sleep of nights&mdash;do not enjoy themselves\\r\\n      much, as a general thing;&mdash;no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though\\r\\n      I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a\\r\\n      Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to\\r\\n      those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable\\r\\n      toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as\\r\\n      much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships,\\r\\n      barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,&mdash;though\\r\\n      I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of\\r\\n      officer on ship-board&mdash;yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;&mdash;though\\r\\n      once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered,\\r\\n      there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say\\r\\n      reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous\\r\\n      dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse,\\r\\n      that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the\\r\\n      pyramids.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,\\r\\n      plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True,\\r\\n      they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like\\r\\n      a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is\\r\\n      unpleasant enough. It touches one&rsquo;s sense of honor, particularly if you\\r\\n      come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or\\r\\n      Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting\\r\\n      your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country\\r\\n      schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition\\r\\n      is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires\\r\\n      a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear\\r\\n      it. But even this wears off in time.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom\\r\\n      and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I\\r\\n      mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel\\r\\n      Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and\\r\\n      respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain&rsquo;t a\\r\\n      slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me\\r\\n      about&mdash;however they may thump and punch me about, I have the\\r\\n      satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one\\r\\n      way or other served in much the same way&mdash;either in a physical or\\r\\n      metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed\\r\\n      round, and all hands should rub each other&rsquo;s shoulder-blades, and be\\r\\n      content.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying\\r\\n      me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I\\r\\n      ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there\\r\\n      is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act\\r\\n      of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two\\r\\n      orchard thieves entailed upon us. But <i>being paid</i>,&mdash;what will compare\\r\\n      with it? The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really\\r\\n      marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root\\r\\n      of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.\\r\\n      Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise\\r\\n      and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are\\r\\n      far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate\\r\\n      the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the\\r\\n      quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the\\r\\n      forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same\\r\\n      way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same\\r\\n      time that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that after\\r\\n      having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it\\r\\n      into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer\\r\\n      of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs\\r\\n      me, and influences me in some unaccountable way&mdash;he can better answer\\r\\n      than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed\\r\\n      part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time\\r\\n      ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more\\r\\n      extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run\\r\\n      something like this:\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;<i>Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States.</i>\\r\\n      &ldquo;WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. &ldquo;BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the\\r\\n      Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others\\r\\n      were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy\\r\\n      parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces&mdash;though I cannot\\r\\n      tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I\\r\\n      think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being\\r\\n      cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about\\r\\n      performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it\\r\\n      was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating\\r\\n      judgment.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale\\r\\n      himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity.\\r\\n      Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the\\r\\n      undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending\\r\\n      marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to\\r\\n      my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been\\r\\n      inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for\\r\\n      things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous\\r\\n      coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and\\r\\n      could still be social with it&mdash;would they let me&mdash;since it is\\r\\n      but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one\\r\\n      lodges in.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great\\r\\n      flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that\\r\\n      swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul,\\r\\n      endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand\\r\\n      hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0002\" id=\"link2HCH0002\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm,\\r\\n      and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city of old\\r\\n      Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in\\r\\n      December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for\\r\\n      Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching that place would\\r\\n      offer, till the following Monday.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at\\r\\n      this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be\\r\\n      related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was made up\\r\\n      to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a fine,\\r\\n      boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old\\r\\n      island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has of late\\r\\n      been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though in this\\r\\n      matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her\\r\\n      great original&mdash;the Tyre of this Carthage;&mdash;the place where the\\r\\n      first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket did\\r\\n      those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give\\r\\n      chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first\\r\\n      adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported\\r\\n      cobblestones&mdash;so goes the story&mdash;to throw at the whales, in\\r\\n      order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the\\r\\n      bowsprit?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in\\r\\n      New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter\\r\\n      of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very\\r\\n      dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and\\r\\n      cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had sounded\\r\\n      my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,&mdash;So, wherever\\r\\n      you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary\\r\\n      street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with\\r\\n      the darkness towards the south&mdash;wherever in your wisdom you may\\r\\n      conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the\\r\\n      price, and don&rsquo;t be too particular.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of &ldquo;The\\r\\n      Crossed Harpoons&rdquo;&mdash;but it looked too expensive and jolly there.\\r\\n      Further on, from the bright red windows of the &ldquo;Sword-Fish Inn,&rdquo; there\\r\\n      came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and\\r\\n      ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten\\r\\n      inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,&mdash;rather weary for me,\\r\\n      when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard,\\r\\n      remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight.\\r\\n      Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the\\r\\n      broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses\\r\\n      within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don&rsquo;t you hear? get away from\\r\\n      before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way. So on I went. I\\r\\n      now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for there,\\r\\n      doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand, and\\r\\n      here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At this\\r\\n      hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of the town\\r\\n      proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding\\r\\n      from a low, wide building, the door of which stood invitingly open. It had\\r\\n      a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the public; so,\\r\\n      entering, the first thing I did was to stumble over an ash-box in the\\r\\n      porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying particles almost choked me, are\\r\\n      these ashes from that destroyed city, Gomorrah? But &ldquo;The Crossed\\r\\n      Harpoons,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Sword-Fish?&rdquo;&mdash;this, then must needs be the sign\\r\\n      of &ldquo;The Trap.&rdquo; However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice\\r\\n      within, pushed on and opened a second, interior door.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black\\r\\n      faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of\\r\\n      Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the\\r\\n      preacher&rsquo;s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and\\r\\n      wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out,\\r\\n      Wretched entertainment at the sign of &lsquo;The Trap!&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks,\\r\\n      and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging\\r\\n      sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a\\r\\n      tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneath&mdash;&ldquo;The\\r\\n      Spouter Inn:&mdash;Peter Coffin.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Coffin?&mdash;Spouter?&mdash;Rather ominous in that particular connexion,\\r\\n      thought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose\\r\\n      this Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and\\r\\n      the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little\\r\\n      wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the\\r\\n      ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a\\r\\n      poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very\\r\\n      spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was a queer sort of place&mdash;a gable-ended old house, one side\\r\\n      palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak\\r\\n      corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling\\r\\n      than ever it did about poor Paul&rsquo;s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless,\\r\\n      is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob\\r\\n      quietly toasting for bed. &ldquo;In judging of that tempestuous wind called\\r\\n      Euroclydon,&rdquo; says an old writer&mdash;of whose works I possess the only\\r\\n      copy extant&mdash;&ldquo;it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest\\r\\n      out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or\\r\\n      whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on\\r\\n      both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.&rdquo; True\\r\\n      enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind&mdash;old\\r\\n      black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this\\r\\n      body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn&rsquo;t stop up the chinks and\\r\\n      the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. But it&rsquo;s\\r\\n      too late to make any improvements now. The universe is finished; the\\r\\n      copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago. Poor\\r\\n      Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow,\\r\\n      and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both\\r\\n      ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not\\r\\n      keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his\\r\\n      red silken wrapper&mdash;(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What\\r\\n      a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them\\r\\n      talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give\\r\\n      me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to\\r\\n      the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than\\r\\n      here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of\\r\\n      the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to\\r\\n      keep out this frost?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the\\r\\n      door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be\\r\\n      moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a Czar\\r\\n      in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a\\r\\n      temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is\\r\\n      plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet,\\r\\n      and see what sort of a place this &ldquo;Spouter&rdquo; may be.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0003\" id=\"link2HCH0003\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low,\\r\\n      straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of the\\r\\n      bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large\\r\\n      oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the\\r\\n      unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent study\\r\\n      and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of the\\r\\n      neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its\\r\\n      purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first\\r\\n      you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New\\r\\n      England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint of\\r\\n      much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and\\r\\n      especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the\\r\\n      entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild,\\r\\n      might not be altogether unwarranted.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous,\\r\\n      black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three\\r\\n      blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy,\\r\\n      soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted.\\r\\n      Yet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity\\r\\n      about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily took an oath\\r\\n      with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant. Ever and\\r\\n      anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.&mdash;It&rsquo;s\\r\\n      the Black Sea in a midnight gale.&mdash;It&rsquo;s the unnatural combat of the\\r\\n      four primal elements.&mdash;It&rsquo;s a blasted heath.&mdash;It&rsquo;s a Hyperborean\\r\\n      winter scene.&mdash;It&rsquo;s the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time.\\r\\n      But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in\\r\\n      the picture&rsquo;s midst. <i>That</i> once found out, and all the rest were plain. But\\r\\n      stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the\\r\\n      great leviathan himself?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In fact, the artist&rsquo;s design seemed this: a final theory of my own, partly\\r\\n      based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I\\r\\n      conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a\\r\\n      great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three\\r\\n      dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to\\r\\n      spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself\\r\\n      upon the three mast-heads.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array\\r\\n      of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with glittering teeth\\r\\n      resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of human hair; and\\r\\n      one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment\\r\\n      made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower. You shuddered as you\\r\\n      gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have\\r\\n      gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying implement. Mixed\\r\\n      with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and\\r\\n      deformed. Some were storied weapons. With this once long lance, now wildly\\r\\n      elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a\\r\\n      sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon&mdash;so like a corkscrew now&mdash;was\\r\\n      flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards slain\\r\\n      off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like\\r\\n      a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty\\r\\n      feet, and at last was found imbedded in the hump.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way&mdash;cut\\r\\n      through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with\\r\\n      fireplaces all round&mdash;you enter the public room. A still duskier\\r\\n      place is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled\\r\\n      planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft&rsquo;s\\r\\n      cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored\\r\\n      old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like\\r\\n      table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities\\r\\n      gathered from this wide world&rsquo;s remotest nooks. Projecting from the\\r\\n      further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den&mdash;the bar&mdash;a\\r\\n      rude attempt at a right whale&rsquo;s head. Be that how it may, there stands the\\r\\n      vast arched bone of the whale&rsquo;s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive\\r\\n      beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters,\\r\\n      bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction, like another\\r\\n      cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him), bustles a little\\r\\n      withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums\\r\\n      and death.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true\\r\\n      cylinders without&mdash;within, the villanous green goggling glasses\\r\\n      deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians\\r\\n      rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads&rsquo; goblets. Fill to\\r\\n      <i>this</i> mark, and your charge is but a penny; to <i>this</i> a penny more; and so on\\r\\n      to the full glass&mdash;the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp down for\\r\\n      a shilling.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a\\r\\n      table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of <i>skrimshander</i>. I sought\\r\\n      the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room,\\r\\n      received for answer that his house was full&mdash;not a bed unoccupied.\\r\\n      &ldquo;But avast,&rdquo; he added, tapping his forehead, &ldquo;you haint no objections to\\r\\n      sharing a harpooneer&rsquo;s blanket, have ye? I s&rsquo;pose you are goin&rsquo; a-whalin&rsquo;,\\r\\n      so you&rsquo;d better get used to that sort of thing.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should ever\\r\\n      do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that if he\\r\\n      (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the harpooneer was\\r\\n      not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander further about a\\r\\n      strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with the half of any\\r\\n      decent man&rsquo;s blanket.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?&mdash;you want supper?\\r\\n      Supper&rsquo;ll be ready directly.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the\\r\\n      Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with\\r\\n      his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space\\r\\n      between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he\\r\\n      didn&rsquo;t make much headway, I thought.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining\\r\\n      room. It was cold as Iceland&mdash;no fire at all&mdash;the landlord said\\r\\n      he couldn&rsquo;t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a\\r\\n      winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold to\\r\\n      our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the fare\\r\\n      was of the most substantial kind&mdash;not only meat and potatoes, but\\r\\n      dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a green\\r\\n      box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have the nightmare to a dead\\r\\n      sartainty.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Landlord,&rdquo; I whispered, &ldquo;that aint the harpooneer is it?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, &ldquo;the harpooneer\\r\\n      is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he don&rsquo;t&mdash;he\\r\\n      eats nothing but steaks, and he likes &rsquo;em rare.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The devil he does,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be here afore long,&rdquo; was the answer.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this &ldquo;dark\\r\\n      complexioned&rdquo; harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so\\r\\n      turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into bed\\r\\n      before I did.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not what\\r\\n      else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a\\r\\n      looker on.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord\\r\\n      cried, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Grampus&rsquo;s crew. I seed her reported in the offing this\\r\\n      morning; a three years&rsquo; voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now we&rsquo;ll\\r\\n      have the latest news from the Feegees.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open,\\r\\n      and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy\\r\\n      watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all\\r\\n      bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an\\r\\n      eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from their boat, and\\r\\n      this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then, that they made a\\r\\n      straight wake for the whale&rsquo;s mouth&mdash;the bar&mdash;when the wrinkled\\r\\n      little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all\\r\\n      round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed\\r\\n      him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a\\r\\n      sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how\\r\\n      long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the\\r\\n      weather side of an ice-island.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even with\\r\\n      the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began capering about\\r\\n      most obstreperously.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though he\\r\\n      seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own\\r\\n      sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as\\r\\n      the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods had\\r\\n      ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though but a\\r\\n      sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will here\\r\\n      venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six feet in\\r\\n      height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have seldom\\r\\n      seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt, making his\\r\\n      white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep shadows of his\\r\\n      eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.\\r\\n      His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine\\r\\n      stature, I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the\\r\\n      Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry of his companions had\\r\\n      mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more\\r\\n      of him till he became my comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he\\r\\n      was missed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge\\r\\n      favourite with them, they raised a cry of &ldquo;Bulkington! Bulkington! where&rsquo;s\\r\\n      Bulkington?&rdquo; and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was now about nine o&rsquo;clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally\\r\\n      quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little\\r\\n      plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal\\r\\n      rather not sleep with your own brother. I don&rsquo;t know how it is, but people\\r\\n      like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to sleeping\\r\\n      with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that\\r\\n      stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely multiply. Nor was\\r\\n      there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more\\r\\n      than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than\\r\\n      bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all sleep together in one\\r\\n      apartment, but you have your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own\\r\\n      blanket, and sleep in your own skin.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\\r\\n      thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a\\r\\n      harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of\\r\\n      the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.\\r\\n      Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home\\r\\n      and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at midnight&mdash;how\\r\\n      could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Landlord! I&rsquo;ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.&mdash;I shan&rsquo;t\\r\\n      sleep with him. I&rsquo;ll try the bench here.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Just as you please; I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t spare ye a tablecloth for a\\r\\n      mattress, and it&rsquo;s a plaguy rough board here&rdquo;&mdash;feeling of the knots\\r\\n      and notches. &ldquo;But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I&rsquo;ve got a carpenter&rsquo;s plane\\r\\n      there in the bar&mdash;wait, I say, and I&rsquo;ll make ye snug enough.&rdquo; So\\r\\n      saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first\\r\\n      dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while\\r\\n      grinning like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the\\r\\n      plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was near\\r\\n      spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven&rsquo;s sake to quit&mdash;the\\r\\n      bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing in\\r\\n      the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the\\r\\n      shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in the\\r\\n      middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a brown\\r\\n      study.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\\r\\n      short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too\\r\\n      narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than\\r\\n      the planed one&mdash;so there was no yoking them. I then placed the first\\r\\n      bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall, leaving a\\r\\n      little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I soon found\\r\\n      that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of\\r\\n      the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially as another\\r\\n      current from the rickety door met the one from the window, and both\\r\\n      together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of\\r\\n      the spot where I had thought to spend the night.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn&rsquo;t I steal a\\r\\n      march on him&mdash;bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be\\r\\n      wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon\\r\\n      second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next\\r\\n      morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be\\r\\n      standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending a\\r\\n      sufferable night unless in some other person&rsquo;s bed, I began to think that\\r\\n      after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this\\r\\n      unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I&rsquo;ll wait awhile; he must be dropping in\\r\\n      before long. I&rsquo;ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may become\\r\\n      jolly good bedfellows after all&mdash;there&rsquo;s no telling.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,\\r\\n      and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Landlord!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what sort of a chap is he&mdash;does he always keep\\r\\n      such late hours?&rdquo; It was now hard upon twelve o&rsquo;clock.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be\\r\\n      mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered,\\r\\n      &ldquo;generally he&rsquo;s an early bird&mdash;airley to bed and airley to rise&mdash;yes,\\r\\n      he&rsquo;s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out a peddling,\\r\\n      you see, and I don&rsquo;t see what on airth keeps him so late, unless, may be,\\r\\n      he can&rsquo;t sell his head.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t sell his head?&mdash;What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you\\r\\n      are telling me?&rdquo; getting into a towering rage. &ldquo;Do you pretend to say,\\r\\n      landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday\\r\\n      night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s precisely it,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;and I told him he couldn&rsquo;t sell\\r\\n      it here, the market&rsquo;s overstocked.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;With what?&rdquo; shouted I.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;With heads to be sure; ain&rsquo;t there too many heads in the world?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I tell you what it is, landlord,&rdquo; said I quite calmly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better stop\\r\\n      spinning that yarn to me&mdash;I&rsquo;m not green.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;May be not,&rdquo; taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, &ldquo;but I rayther\\r\\n      guess you&rsquo;ll be done <i>brown</i> if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin&rsquo;\\r\\n      his head.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll break it for him,&rdquo; said I, now flying into a passion again at this\\r\\n      unaccountable farrago of the landlord&rsquo;s.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s broke a&rsquo;ready,&rdquo; said he.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Broke,&rdquo; said I&mdash;&ldquo;<i>broke</i>, do you mean?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Sartain, and that&rsquo;s the very reason he can&rsquo;t sell it, I guess.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Landlord,&rdquo; said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a snow-storm&mdash;&ldquo;landlord,\\r\\n      stop whittling. You and I must understand one another, and that too\\r\\n      without delay. I come to your house and want a bed; you tell me you can\\r\\n      only give me half a one; that the other half belongs to a certain\\r\\n      harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have not yet seen, you\\r\\n      persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending\\r\\n      to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design\\r\\n      for my bedfellow&mdash;a sort of connexion, landlord, which is an intimate\\r\\n      and confidential one in the highest degree. I now demand of you to speak\\r\\n      out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in\\r\\n      all respects safe to spend the night with him. And in the first place, you\\r\\n      will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if\\r\\n      true I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and\\r\\n      I&rsquo;ve no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, <i>you</i> I mean,\\r\\n      landlord, <i>you</i>, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would\\r\\n      thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Wall,&rdquo; said the landlord, fetching a long breath, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a purty long\\r\\n      sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be easy,\\r\\n      this here harpooneer I have been tellin&rsquo; you of has just arrived from the\\r\\n      south seas, where he bought up a lot of &rsquo;balmed New Zealand heads (great\\r\\n      curios, you know), and he&rsquo;s sold all on &rsquo;em but one, and that one he&rsquo;s\\r\\n      trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow&rsquo;s Sunday, and it would not do to\\r\\n      be sellin&rsquo; human heads about the streets when folks is goin&rsquo; to churches.\\r\\n      He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was goin&rsquo; out of\\r\\n      the door with four heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a\\r\\n      string of inions.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed\\r\\n      that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me&mdash;but at\\r\\n      the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a\\r\\n      Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal\\r\\n      business as selling the heads of dead idolators?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He pays reg&rsquo;lar,&rdquo; was the rejoinder. &ldquo;But come, it&rsquo;s getting dreadful\\r\\n      late, you had better be turning flukes&mdash;it&rsquo;s a nice bed; Sal and me\\r\\n      slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There&rsquo;s plenty of room\\r\\n      for two to kick about in that bed; it&rsquo;s an almighty big bed that. Why,\\r\\n      afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot\\r\\n      of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and somehow,\\r\\n      Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm. Arter that,\\r\\n      Sal said it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Come along here, I&rsquo;ll give ye a glim in a jiffy;&rdquo;\\r\\n       and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead\\r\\n      the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he\\r\\n      exclaimed &ldquo;I vum it&rsquo;s Sunday&mdash;you won&rsquo;t see that harpooneer to-night;\\r\\n      he&rsquo;s come to anchor somewhere&mdash;come along then; <i>do</i> come; <i>won&rsquo;t</i> ye\\r\\n      come?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was\\r\\n      ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,\\r\\n      with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers\\r\\n      to sleep abreast.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest\\r\\n      that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; &ldquo;there, make\\r\\n      yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.&rdquo; I turned round from\\r\\n      eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the\\r\\n      most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced\\r\\n      round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no\\r\\n      other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls,\\r\\n      and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of things not\\r\\n      properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown\\r\\n      upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman&rsquo;s bag, containing the\\r\\n      harpooneer&rsquo;s wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there\\r\\n      was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the\\r\\n      fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the\\r\\n      light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive\\r\\n      at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to nothing\\r\\n      but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags\\r\\n      something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin.\\r\\n      There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same in\\r\\n      South American ponchos. But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer\\r\\n      would get into a door mat, and parade the streets of any Christian town in\\r\\n      that sort of guise? I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a\\r\\n      hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as\\r\\n      though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I\\r\\n      went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw\\r\\n      such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I\\r\\n      gave myself a kink in the neck.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\\r\\n      head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on\\r\\n      the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in\\r\\n      the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a\\r\\n      little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now, half\\r\\n      undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about the\\r\\n      harpooneer&rsquo;s not coming home at all that night, it being so very late, I\\r\\n      made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and then\\r\\n      blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care\\r\\n      of heaven.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery, there\\r\\n      is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a\\r\\n      long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly\\r\\n      made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall\\r\\n      in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under\\r\\n      the door.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\\r\\n      head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word\\r\\n      till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New\\r\\n      Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without\\r\\n      looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the\\r\\n      floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords of\\r\\n      the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all eagerness\\r\\n      to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in\\r\\n      unlacing the bag&rsquo;s mouth. This accomplished, however, he turned round&mdash;when,\\r\\n      good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark, purplish,\\r\\n      yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking\\r\\n      squares. Yes, it&rsquo;s just as I thought, he&rsquo;s a terrible bedfellow; he&rsquo;s been\\r\\n      in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon. But\\r\\n      at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I\\r\\n      plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black\\r\\n      squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At first I\\r\\n      knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred\\r\\n      to me. I remembered a story of a white man&mdash;a whaleman too&mdash;who,\\r\\n      falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that\\r\\n      this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with\\r\\n      a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! It&rsquo;s only his\\r\\n      outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make\\r\\n      of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about,\\r\\n      and completely independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it\\r\\n      might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of\\r\\n      a hot sun&rsquo;s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had\\r\\n      never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these\\r\\n      extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were\\r\\n      passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at\\r\\n      all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced\\r\\n      fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a\\r\\n      seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in the\\r\\n      middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head&mdash;a ghastly\\r\\n      thing enough&mdash;and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his\\r\\n      hat&mdash;a new beaver hat&mdash;when I came nigh singing out with fresh\\r\\n      surprise. There was no hair on his head&mdash;none to speak of at least&mdash;nothing\\r\\n      but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head\\r\\n      now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger\\r\\n      stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than\\r\\n      ever I bolted a dinner.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it\\r\\n      was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this\\r\\n      head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance\\r\\n      is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded\\r\\n      about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was\\r\\n      the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night.\\r\\n      In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to\\r\\n      address him, and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed\\r\\n      inexplicable in him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his\\r\\n      chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with\\r\\n      the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same dark\\r\\n      squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years&rsquo; War, and just escaped\\r\\n      from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were\\r\\n      marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of\\r\\n      young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage\\r\\n      or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in\\r\\n      this Christian country. I quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too&mdash;perhaps\\r\\n      the heads of his own brothers. He might take a fancy to mine&mdash;heavens!\\r\\n      look at that tomahawk!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\\r\\n      something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that\\r\\n      he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or\\r\\n      dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the\\r\\n      pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a\\r\\n      hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days&rsquo; old Congo baby.\\r\\n      Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black\\r\\n      manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But seeing that\\r\\n      it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished\\r\\n      ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed\\r\\n      it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and\\r\\n      removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image,\\r\\n      like a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks\\r\\n      inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very\\r\\n      appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill\\r\\n      at ease meantime&mdash;to see what was next to follow. First he takes\\r\\n      about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places\\r\\n      them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top\\r\\n      and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a\\r\\n      sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and\\r\\n      still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be\\r\\n      scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit;\\r\\n      then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it\\r\\n      to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry\\r\\n      sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange antics\\r\\n      were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who\\r\\n      seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or\\r\\n      other, during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.\\r\\n      At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously,\\r\\n      and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a\\r\\n      sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him\\r\\n      now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and\\r\\n      jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before\\r\\n      the light was put out, to break the spell in which I had so long been\\r\\n      bound.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.\\r\\n      Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an\\r\\n      instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle,\\r\\n      he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was\\r\\n      extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang\\r\\n      into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving a sudden\\r\\n      grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him against\\r\\n      the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep\\r\\n      quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural\\r\\n      responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Who-e debel you?&rdquo;&mdash;he at last said&mdash;&ldquo;you no speak-e, dam-me, I\\r\\n      kill-e.&rdquo; And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in\\r\\n      the dark.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Landlord, for God&rsquo;s sake, Peter Coffin!&rdquo; shouted I. &ldquo;Landlord! Watch!\\r\\n      Coffin! Angels! save me!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!&rdquo; again growled the\\r\\n      cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot\\r\\n      tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire. But\\r\\n      thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light in\\r\\n      hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid now,&rdquo; said he, grinning again, &ldquo;Queequeg here wouldn&rsquo;t\\r\\n      harm a hair of your head.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Stop your grinning,&rdquo; shouted I, &ldquo;and why didn&rsquo;t you tell me that that\\r\\n      infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I thought ye know&rsquo;d it;&mdash;didn&rsquo;t I tell ye, he was a peddlin&rsquo; heads\\r\\n      around town?&mdash;but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look\\r\\n      here&mdash;you sabbee me, I sabbee&mdash;you this man sleepe you&mdash;you\\r\\n      sabbee?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Me sabbee plenty&rdquo;&mdash;grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and\\r\\n      sitting up in bed.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;You gettee in,&rdquo; he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and throwing\\r\\n      the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil but a\\r\\n      really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment. For all\\r\\n      his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal.\\r\\n      What&rsquo;s all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to myself&mdash;the\\r\\n      man&rsquo;s a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason to fear me,\\r\\n      as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a\\r\\n      drunken Christian.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Landlord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or\\r\\n      whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will turn\\r\\n      in with him. But I don&rsquo;t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me. It&rsquo;s\\r\\n      dangerous. Besides, I ain&rsquo;t insured.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely\\r\\n      motioned me to get into bed&mdash;rolling over to one side as much as to\\r\\n      say&mdash;&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t touch a leg of ye.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Good night, landlord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you may go.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I turned in, and never slept better in my life.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0004\" id=\"link2HCH0004\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 4. The Counterpane.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg&rsquo;s arm thrown\\r\\n      over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost thought\\r\\n      I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little\\r\\n      parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all\\r\\n      over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of\\r\\n      which were of one precise shade&mdash;owing I suppose to his keeping his\\r\\n      arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly\\r\\n      rolled up at various times&mdash;this same arm of his, I say, looked for\\r\\n      all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly\\r\\n      lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from\\r\\n      the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the\\r\\n      sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging\\r\\n      me.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a\\r\\n      child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;\\r\\n      whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The\\r\\n      circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other&mdash;I\\r\\n      think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little sweep\\r\\n      do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other, was all\\r\\n      the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,&mdash;my mother\\r\\n      dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed, though\\r\\n      it was only two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of the 21st June, the longest day\\r\\n      in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But there was no help\\r\\n      for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor,\\r\\n      undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a\\r\\n      bitter sigh got between the sheets.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse\\r\\n      before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small of\\r\\n      my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun shining in\\r\\n      at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the streets, and the\\r\\n      sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse and worse&mdash;at\\r\\n      last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my stockinged feet,\\r\\n      sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at her feet,\\r\\n      beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my\\r\\n      misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an\\r\\n      unendurable length of time. But she was the best and most conscientious of\\r\\n      stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For several hours I lay\\r\\n      there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since,\\r\\n      even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes. At last I must have fallen\\r\\n      into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it&mdash;half\\r\\n      steeped in dreams&mdash;I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was\\r\\n      now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a shock running through\\r\\n      all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a\\r\\n      supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung over the counterpane,\\r\\n      and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which the hand\\r\\n      belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled\\r\\n      on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag\\r\\n      away my hand; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single\\r\\n      inch, the horrid spell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness\\r\\n      at last glided away from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly\\r\\n      remembered it all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost\\r\\n      myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very\\r\\n      hour, I often puzzle myself with it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\\r\\n      supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to\\r\\n      those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg&rsquo;s pagan arm\\r\\n      thrown round me. But at length all the past night&rsquo;s events soberly\\r\\n      recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to the\\r\\n      comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm&mdash;unlock his\\r\\n      bridegroom clasp&mdash;yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me\\r\\n      tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to\\r\\n      rouse him&mdash;&ldquo;Queequeg!&rdquo;&mdash;but his only answer was a snore. I then\\r\\n      rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly\\r\\n      felt a slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the\\r\\n      tomahawk sleeping by the savage&rsquo;s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced\\r\\n      baby. A pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in\\r\\n      the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! &ldquo;Queequeg!&mdash;in the\\r\\n      name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!&rdquo; At length, by dint of much wriggling,\\r\\n      and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his\\r\\n      hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in\\r\\n      extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all\\r\\n      over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff\\r\\n      as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not\\r\\n      altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim consciousness of\\r\\n      knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him. Meanwhile, I\\r\\n      lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon\\r\\n      narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at last, his mind seemed\\r\\n      made up touching the character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it\\r\\n      were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain\\r\\n      signs and sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would\\r\\n      dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole\\r\\n      apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances, this is\\r\\n      a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages have an innate\\r\\n      sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous how essentially\\r\\n      polite they are. I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg, because he\\r\\n      treated me with so much civility and consideration, while I was guilty of\\r\\n      great rudeness; staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette\\r\\n      motions; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding.\\r\\n      Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don&rsquo;t see every day, he and his ways\\r\\n      were well worth unusual regarding.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one,\\r\\n      by the by, and then&mdash;still minus his trowsers&mdash;he hunted up his\\r\\n      boots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next\\r\\n      movement was to crush himself&mdash;boots in hand, and hat on&mdash;under\\r\\n      the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he\\r\\n      was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I\\r\\n      ever heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his\\r\\n      boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition stage&mdash;neither\\r\\n      caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized to show off his\\r\\n      outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His education was not\\r\\n      yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not been a small degree\\r\\n      civilized, he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at\\r\\n      all; but then, if he had not been still a savage, he never would have\\r\\n      dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At last, he emerged with\\r\\n      his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began\\r\\n      creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed to\\r\\n      boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones&mdash;probably not made to\\r\\n      order either&mdash;rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of\\r\\n      a bitter cold morning.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\\r\\n      street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view into\\r\\n      the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg\\r\\n      made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on; I begged\\r\\n      him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and\\r\\n      particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He complied,\\r\\n      and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the morning any\\r\\n      Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my amazement,\\r\\n      contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest, arms, and\\r\\n      hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on\\r\\n      the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering\\r\\n      his face. I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and\\r\\n      behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long\\r\\n      wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and\\r\\n      striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous\\r\\n      scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this is\\r\\n      using Rogers&rsquo;s best cutlery with a vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the\\r\\n      less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of\\r\\n      a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are\\r\\n      always kept.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of\\r\\n      the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his\\r\\n      harpoon like a marshal&rsquo;s baton.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0005\" id=\"link2HCH0005\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 5. Breakfast.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the\\r\\n      grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him,\\r\\n      though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my\\r\\n      bedfellow.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a good\\r\\n      thing; the more&rsquo;s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper person,\\r\\n      afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be backward, but let\\r\\n      him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way. And the\\r\\n      man that has anything bountifully laughable about him, be sure there is\\r\\n      more in that man than you perhaps think for.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the\\r\\n      night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were\\r\\n      nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and\\r\\n      sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and\\r\\n      ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an unshorn,\\r\\n      shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This\\r\\n      young fellow&rsquo;s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and would\\r\\n      seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days landed from\\r\\n      his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades lighter; you might\\r\\n      say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the complexion of a third still\\r\\n      lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached withal; <i>he</i> doubtless has\\r\\n      tarried whole weeks ashore. But who could show a cheek like Queequeg?\\r\\n      which, barred with various tints, seemed like the Andes&rsquo; western slope, to\\r\\n      show forth in one array, contrasting climates, zone by zone.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Grub, ho!&rdquo; now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we went\\r\\n      to breakfast.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease in\\r\\n      manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though: Ledyard, the\\r\\n      great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch one; of all men,\\r\\n      they possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But perhaps the mere\\r\\n      crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the\\r\\n      taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart of\\r\\n      Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo&rsquo;s performances&mdash;this kind of\\r\\n      travel, I say, may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social\\r\\n      polish. Still, for the most part, that sort of thing is to be had\\r\\n      anywhere.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after\\r\\n      we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some good\\r\\n      stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man\\r\\n      maintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked\\r\\n      embarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the\\r\\n      slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas&mdash;entire\\r\\n      strangers to them&mdash;and duelled them dead without winking; and yet,\\r\\n      here they sat at a social breakfast table&mdash;all of the same calling,\\r\\n      all of kindred tastes&mdash;looking round as sheepishly at each other as\\r\\n      though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green\\r\\n      Mountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior\\r\\n      whalemen!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But as for Queequeg&mdash;why, Queequeg sat there among them&mdash;at the\\r\\n      head of the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I\\r\\n      cannot say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have\\r\\n      cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and\\r\\n      using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it, to the\\r\\n      imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks towards him.\\r\\n      But <i>that</i> was certainly very coolly done by him, and every one knows that\\r\\n      in most people&rsquo;s estimation, to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      We will not speak of all Queequeg&rsquo;s peculiarities here; how he eschewed\\r\\n      coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks,\\r\\n      done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest\\r\\n      into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there\\r\\n      quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on, when I sallied\\r\\n      out for a stroll.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0006\" id=\"link2HCH0006\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 6. The Street.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an\\r\\n      individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized\\r\\n      town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll\\r\\n      through the streets of New Bedford.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will frequently\\r\\n      offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts. Even\\r\\n      in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners will sometimes\\r\\n      jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and\\r\\n      Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live Yankees have often scared\\r\\n      the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping. In these\\r\\n      last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual\\r\\n      cannibals stand chatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom\\r\\n      yet carry on their bones unholy flesh. It makes a stranger stare.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,\\r\\n      and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft\\r\\n      which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still\\r\\n      more curious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town\\r\\n      scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and\\r\\n      glory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows\\r\\n      who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the\\r\\n      whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came. In\\r\\n      some things you would think them but a few hours old. Look there! that\\r\\n      chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat and swallow-tailed\\r\\n      coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife. Here comes another with\\r\\n      a sou&rsquo;-wester and a bombazine cloak.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one&mdash;I mean a\\r\\n      downright bumpkin dandy&mdash;a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his\\r\\n      two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a\\r\\n      country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished\\r\\n      reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the comical\\r\\n      things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his sea-outfit, he\\r\\n      orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his canvas trowsers. Ah,\\r\\n      poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling\\r\\n      gale, when thou art driven, straps, buttons, and all, down the throat of\\r\\n      the tempest.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and\\r\\n      bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a queer\\r\\n      place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this day\\r\\n      perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador. As it\\r\\n      is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten one, they look so\\r\\n      bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in, in all New\\r\\n      England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not like Canaan; a land,\\r\\n      also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run with milk; nor in the\\r\\n      spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs. Yet, in spite of this,\\r\\n      nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and\\r\\n      gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came they? how planted\\r\\n      upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty\\r\\n      mansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses\\r\\n      and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans.\\r\\n      One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of\\r\\n      the sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their\\r\\n      daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece. You\\r\\n      must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they\\r\\n      have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly burn\\r\\n      their lengths in spermaceti candles.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples&mdash;long\\r\\n      avenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful and\\r\\n      bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by their\\r\\n      tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is art;\\r\\n      which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces\\r\\n      of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation&rsquo;s final\\r\\n      day.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But\\r\\n      roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is\\r\\n      perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that bloom\\r\\n      of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young girls\\r\\n      breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore, as\\r\\n      though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the\\r\\n      Puritanic sands.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0007\" id=\"link2HCH0007\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 7. The Chapel.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman&rsquo;s Chapel, and few are the\\r\\n      moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who fail\\r\\n      to make a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure that I did not.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this\\r\\n      special errand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving\\r\\n      sleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called\\r\\n      bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found a\\r\\n      small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors&rsquo; wives and widows. A\\r\\n      muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm.\\r\\n      Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other, as\\r\\n      if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable. The chaplain had not\\r\\n      yet arrived; and there these silent islands of men and women sat\\r\\n      steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned\\r\\n      into the wall on either side the pulpit. Three of them ran something like\\r\\n      the following, but I do not pretend to quote:&mdash;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who, at the age of eighteen, was lost\\r\\n      overboard, Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia, <i>November</i> 1<i>st</i>, 1836.\\r\\n      THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS SISTER.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN, WALTER\\r\\n      CANNY, SETH MACY, AND SAMUEL GLEIG, Forming one of the boats&rsquo; crews OF THE\\r\\n      SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale, On the Off-shore Ground\\r\\n      in the PACIFIC, <i>December</i> 31<i>st</i>, 1839. THIS MARBLE Is here placed by their\\r\\n      surviving SHIPMATES.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY, Who in the bows of\\r\\n      his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan, <i>August</i> 3<i>d</i>,\\r\\n      1833. THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS WIDOW.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated myself\\r\\n      near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me.\\r\\n      Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gaze of\\r\\n      incredulous curiosity in his countenance. This savage was the only person\\r\\n      present who seemed to notice my entrance; because he was the only one who\\r\\n      could not read, and, therefore, was not reading those frigid inscriptions\\r\\n      on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names\\r\\n      appeared there were now among the congregation, I knew not; but so many\\r\\n      are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery, and so plainly did several\\r\\n      women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing\\r\\n      grief, that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those, in whose\\r\\n      unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused\\r\\n      the old wounds to bleed afresh.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing among\\r\\n      flowers can say&mdash;here, <i>here</i> lies my beloved; ye know not the\\r\\n      desolation that broods in bosoms like these. What bitter blanks in those\\r\\n      black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes! What despair in those\\r\\n      immovable inscriptions! What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the\\r\\n      lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse resurrections to the\\r\\n      beings who have placelessly perished without a grave. As well might those\\r\\n      tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included; why\\r\\n      it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no tales,\\r\\n      though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it is that to\\r\\n      his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix so\\r\\n      significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if he but\\r\\n      embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth; why the Life\\r\\n      Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals; in what eternal,\\r\\n      unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam\\r\\n      who died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we still refuse to be\\r\\n      comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in\\r\\n      unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all the dead;\\r\\n      wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city.\\r\\n      All these things are not without their meanings.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead\\r\\n      doubts she gathers her most vital hope.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a\\r\\n      Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky light\\r\\n      of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone\\r\\n      before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But somehow I grew\\r\\n      merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine chance for promotion,\\r\\n      it seems&mdash;aye, a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet. Yes,\\r\\n      there is death in this business of whaling&mdash;a speechlessly quick\\r\\n      chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what then? Methinks we have\\r\\n      hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death. Methinks that what they\\r\\n      call my shadow here on earth is my true substance. Methinks that in\\r\\n      looking at things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the\\r\\n      sun through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.\\r\\n      Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being. In fact take my body\\r\\n      who will, take it I say, it is not me. And therefore three cheers for\\r\\n      Nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove body when they will, for stave\\r\\n      my soul, Jove himself cannot.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0008\" id=\"link2HCH0008\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 8. The Pulpit.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable\\r\\n      robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon\\r\\n      admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,\\r\\n      sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it was\\r\\n      the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he was a\\r\\n      very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth,\\r\\n      but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry. At the\\r\\n      time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy\\r\\n      old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering\\r\\n      youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain\\r\\n      mild gleams of a newly developing bloom&mdash;the spring verdure peeping\\r\\n      forth even beneath February&rsquo;s snow. No one having previously heard his\\r\\n      history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost\\r\\n      interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities\\r\\n      about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led. When he\\r\\n      entered I observed that he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come\\r\\n      in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and\\r\\n      his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with\\r\\n      the weight of the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and\\r\\n      overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an\\r\\n      adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the\\r\\n      pulpit.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\\r\\n      regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor,\\r\\n      seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the architect, it\\r\\n      seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit\\r\\n      without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like those\\r\\n      used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling captain\\r\\n      had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for\\r\\n      this ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with a\\r\\n      mahogany colour, the whole contrivance, considering what manner of chapel\\r\\n      it was, seemed by no means in bad taste. Halting for an instant at the\\r\\n      foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of\\r\\n      the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly\\r\\n      sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the\\r\\n      steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case with\\r\\n      swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood,\\r\\n      so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of the\\r\\n      pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship, these\\r\\n      joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not prepared\\r\\n      to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn round, and\\r\\n      stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder step by step,\\r\\n      till the whole was deposited within, leaving him impregnable in his little\\r\\n      Quebec.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\\r\\n      Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity,\\r\\n      that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of\\r\\n      the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober reason for this thing;\\r\\n      furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen. Can it be, then, that by\\r\\n      that act of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for\\r\\n      the time, from all outward worldly ties and connexions? Yes, for\\r\\n      replenished with the meat and wine of the word, to the faithful man of\\r\\n      God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing stronghold&mdash;a lofty\\r\\n      Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water within the walls.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\\r\\n      borrowed from the chaplain&rsquo;s former sea-farings. Between the marble\\r\\n      cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was\\r\\n      adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against\\r\\n      a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers. But\\r\\n      high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there floated a little\\r\\n      isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel&rsquo;s face; and this bright\\r\\n      face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship&rsquo;s tossed deck,\\r\\n      something like that silver plate now inserted into the Victory&rsquo;s plank\\r\\n      where Nelson fell. &ldquo;Ah, noble ship,&rdquo; the angel seemed to say, &ldquo;beat on,\\r\\n      beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is\\r\\n      breaking through; the clouds are rolling off&mdash;serenest azure is at\\r\\n      hand.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had\\r\\n      achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the\\r\\n      likeness of a ship&rsquo;s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a projecting\\r\\n      piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship&rsquo;s fiddle-headed beak.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      What could be more full of meaning?&mdash;for the pulpit is ever this\\r\\n      earth&rsquo;s foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads\\r\\n      the world. From thence it is the storm of God&rsquo;s quick wrath is first\\r\\n      descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is the\\r\\n      God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds. Yes,\\r\\n      the world&rsquo;s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete; and the\\r\\n      pulpit is its prow.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0009\" id=\"link2HCH0009\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 9. The Sermon.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered\\r\\n      the scattered people to condense. &ldquo;Starboard gangway, there! side away to\\r\\n      larboard&mdash;larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a still\\r\\n      slighter shuffling of women&rsquo;s shoes, and all was quiet again, and every\\r\\n      eye on the preacher.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit&rsquo;s bows, folded his large\\r\\n      brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and offered a\\r\\n      prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom\\r\\n      of the sea.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a\\r\\n      bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog&mdash;in such tones he\\r\\n      commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards the\\r\\n      concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy&mdash;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n<pre xml:space=\"preserve\">\\r\\n     &ldquo;The ribs and terrors in the whale,\\r\\n     Arched over me a dismal gloom,\\r\\n     While all God&rsquo;s sun-lit waves rolled by,\\r\\n     And lift me deepening down to doom.\\r\\n\\r\\n     &ldquo;I saw the opening maw of hell,\\r\\n     With endless pains and sorrows there;\\r\\n     Which none but they that feel can tell&mdash;\\r\\n     Oh, I was plunging to despair.\\r\\n\\r\\n     &ldquo;In black distress, I called my God,\\r\\n     When I could scarce believe him mine,\\r\\n     He bowed his ear to my complaints&mdash;\\r\\n     No more the whale did me confine.\\r\\n\\r\\n     &ldquo;With speed he flew to my relief,\\r\\n     As on a radiant dolphin borne;\\r\\n     Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone\\r\\n     The face of my Deliverer God.\\r\\n\\r\\n     &ldquo;My song for ever shall record\\r\\n     That terrible, that joyful hour;\\r\\n     I give the glory to my God,\\r\\n     His all the mercy and the power.&rdquo;\\r\\n </pre>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the\\r\\n      howling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned\\r\\n      over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the\\r\\n      proper page, said: &ldquo;Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the first\\r\\n      chapter of Jonah&mdash;&lsquo;And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up\\r\\n      Jonah.&rsquo;&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters&mdash;four yarns&mdash;is\\r\\n      one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet\\r\\n      what depths of the soul does Jonah&rsquo;s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant\\r\\n      lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in the\\r\\n      fish&rsquo;s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the floods\\r\\n      surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters;\\r\\n      sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But <i>what</i> is this lesson\\r\\n      that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a\\r\\n      lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the\\r\\n      living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story\\r\\n      of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift\\r\\n      punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of\\r\\n      Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was\\r\\n      in his wilful disobedience of the command of God&mdash;never mind now what\\r\\n      that command was, or how conveyed&mdash;which he found a hard command. But\\r\\n      all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do&mdash;remember\\r\\n      that&mdash;and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade.\\r\\n      And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this\\r\\n      disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at God,\\r\\n      by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men will carry\\r\\n      him into countries where God does not reign, but only the Captains of this\\r\\n      earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that&rsquo;s bound\\r\\n      for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By\\r\\n      all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz.\\r\\n      That&rsquo;s the opinion of learned men. And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is\\r\\n      in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed\\r\\n      in those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.\\r\\n      Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast\\r\\n      of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two\\r\\n      thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the Straits of\\r\\n      Gibraltar. See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee\\r\\n      world-wide from God? Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of\\r\\n      all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God;\\r\\n      prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the\\r\\n      seas. So disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been\\r\\n      policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong,\\r\\n      had been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he&rsquo;s a fugitive! no\\r\\n      baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,&mdash;no friends accompany\\r\\n      him to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he\\r\\n      finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he\\r\\n      steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the\\r\\n      moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger&rsquo;s evil eye.\\r\\n      Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence; in\\r\\n      vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure the\\r\\n      mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but still serious way,\\r\\n      one whispers to the other&mdash;&ldquo;Jack, he&rsquo;s robbed a widow;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Joe, do\\r\\n      you mark him; he&rsquo;s a bigamist;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Harry lad, I guess he&rsquo;s the adulterer\\r\\n      that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing murderers\\r\\n      from Sodom.&rdquo; Another runs to read the bill that&rsquo;s stuck against the spile\\r\\n      upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold\\r\\n      coins for the apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of\\r\\n      his person. He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his\\r\\n      sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands\\r\\n      upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his boldness to his\\r\\n      face, only looks so much the more a coward. He will not confess himself\\r\\n      suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of\\r\\n      it; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised,\\r\\n      they let him pass, and he descends into the cabin.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making out\\r\\n      his papers for the Customs&mdash;&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; Oh! how that harmless\\r\\n      question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again. But\\r\\n      he rallies. &lsquo;I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon sail ye,\\r\\n      sir?&rsquo; Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah, though the man\\r\\n      now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice, than\\r\\n      he darts a scrutinizing glance. &lsquo;We sail with the next coming tide,&rsquo; at\\r\\n      last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing him. &lsquo;No sooner, sir?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Soon\\r\\n      enough for any honest man that goes a passenger.&rsquo; Ha! Jonah, that&rsquo;s\\r\\n      another stab. But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll\\r\\n      sail with ye,&rsquo;&mdash;he says,&mdash;&lsquo;the passage money how much is that?&mdash;I&rsquo;ll\\r\\n      pay now.&rsquo; For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing\\r\\n      not to be overlooked in this history, &lsquo;that he paid the fare thereof&rsquo; ere\\r\\n      the craft did sail. And taken with the context, this is full of meaning.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Now Jonah&rsquo;s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects crime\\r\\n      in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In this\\r\\n      world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without a\\r\\n      passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers. So\\r\\n      Jonah&rsquo;s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah&rsquo;s purse, ere he judge\\r\\n      him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum; and it&rsquo;s assented to.\\r\\n      Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same time\\r\\n      resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold. Yet when Jonah\\r\\n      fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still molest the Captain.\\r\\n      He rings every coin to find a counterfeit. Not a forger, any way, he\\r\\n      mutters; and Jonah is put down for his passage. &lsquo;Point out my state-room,\\r\\n      Sir,&rsquo; says Jonah now, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m travel-weary; I need sleep.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thou lookest like\\r\\n      it,&rsquo; says the Captain, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s thy room.&rsquo; Jonah enters, and would lock\\r\\n      the door, but the lock contains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling\\r\\n      there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about\\r\\n      the doors of convicts&rsquo; cells being never allowed to be locked within. All\\r\\n      dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds\\r\\n      the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is\\r\\n      close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath\\r\\n      the ship&rsquo;s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that\\r\\n      stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his\\r\\n      bowels&rsquo; wards.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly oscillates\\r\\n      in Jonah&rsquo;s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf with the\\r\\n      weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in\\r\\n      slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the\\r\\n      room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it but made obvious\\r\\n      the false, lying levels among which it hung. The lamp alarms and frightens\\r\\n      Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and\\r\\n      this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance.\\r\\n      But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor,\\r\\n      the ceiling, and the side, are all awry. &lsquo;Oh! so my conscience hangs in\\r\\n      me!&rsquo; he groans, &lsquo;straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my\\r\\n      soul are all in crookedness!&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still\\r\\n      reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the\\r\\n      Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as\\r\\n      one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish,\\r\\n      praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid the\\r\\n      whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the man who\\r\\n      bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and there&rsquo;s naught to\\r\\n      staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, Jonah&rsquo;s prodigy of\\r\\n      ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and\\r\\n      from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,\\r\\n      glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers!\\r\\n      the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not bear the wicked\\r\\n      burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to break. But now when\\r\\n      the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars\\r\\n      are clattering overboard; when the wind is shrieking, and the men are\\r\\n      yelling, and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah&rsquo;s\\r\\n      head; in all this raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees\\r\\n      no black sky and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little\\r\\n      hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with\\r\\n      open mouth is cleaving the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone\\r\\n      down into the sides of the ship&mdash;a berth in the cabin as I have taken\\r\\n      it, and was fast asleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and\\r\\n      shrieks in his dead ear, &lsquo;What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!&rsquo; Startled\\r\\n      from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and\\r\\n      stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at\\r\\n      that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the\\r\\n      bulwarks. Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy\\r\\n      vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning\\r\\n      while yet afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face\\r\\n      from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the\\r\\n      rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again\\r\\n      towards the tormented deep.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his cringing\\r\\n      attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The sailors mark\\r\\n      him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last,\\r\\n      fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to high Heaven,\\r\\n      they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this great tempest was\\r\\n      upon them. The lot is Jonah&rsquo;s; that discovered, then how furiously they\\r\\n      mob him with their questions. &lsquo;What is thine occupation? Whence comest\\r\\n      thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior\\r\\n      of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from;\\r\\n      whereas, they not only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise\\r\\n      another answer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer\\r\\n      is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am a Hebrew,&rsquo; he cries&mdash;and then&mdash;&lsquo;I fear the Lord the God\\r\\n      of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!&rsquo; Fear him, O Jonah? Aye,\\r\\n      well mightest thou fear the Lord God <i>then!</i> Straightway, he now goes on to\\r\\n      make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more\\r\\n      appalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating God\\r\\n      for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts,&mdash;when\\r\\n      wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the\\r\\n      sea, for he knew that for <i>his</i> sake this great tempest was upon them; they\\r\\n      mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means to save the ship. But\\r\\n      all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder; then, with one hand raised\\r\\n      invokingly to God, with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of\\r\\n      Jonah.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea; when\\r\\n      instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea is still,\\r\\n      as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water behind. He\\r\\n      goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he\\r\\n      scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws\\r\\n      awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth, like so many\\r\\n      white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the\\r\\n      fish&rsquo;s belly. But observe his prayer, and learn a weighty lesson. For\\r\\n      sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance. He\\r\\n      feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He leaves all his deliverance\\r\\n      to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his pains and\\r\\n      pangs, he will still look towards His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is\\r\\n      true and faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for\\r\\n      punishment. And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in\\r\\n      the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I\\r\\n      do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him\\r\\n      before you as a model for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to\\r\\n      repent of it like Jonah.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking, slanting\\r\\n      storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who, when\\r\\n      describing Jonah&rsquo;s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself. His deep\\r\\n      chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed the warring\\r\\n      elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy\\r\\n      brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his simple hearers look\\r\\n      on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the leaves\\r\\n      of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with closed\\r\\n      eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly,\\r\\n      with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these words:\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press upon\\r\\n      me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah\\r\\n      teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me, for I\\r\\n      am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come down from\\r\\n      this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit, and listen as\\r\\n      you listen, while some one of you reads <i>me</i> that other and more awful\\r\\n      lesson which Jonah teaches to <i>me</i>, as a pilot of the living God. How being\\r\\n      an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true things, and bidden by the\\r\\n      Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh,\\r\\n      Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled from his mission,\\r\\n      and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa. But God\\r\\n      is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we have seen, God came upon\\r\\n      him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom, and with\\r\\n      swift slantings tore him along &lsquo;into the midst of the seas,&rsquo; where the\\r\\n      eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and &lsquo;the weeds were\\r\\n      wrapped about his head,&rsquo; and all the watery world of woe bowled over him.\\r\\n      Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet&mdash;&lsquo;out of the belly of\\r\\n      hell&rsquo;&mdash;when the whale grounded upon the ocean&rsquo;s utmost bones, even\\r\\n      then, God heard the engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God\\r\\n      spake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the\\r\\n      sea, the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and\\r\\n      all the delights of air and earth; and &lsquo;vomited out Jonah upon the dry\\r\\n      land;&rsquo; when the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised\\r\\n      and beaten&mdash;his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously\\r\\n      murmuring of the ocean&mdash;Jonah did the Almighty&rsquo;s bidding. And what\\r\\n      was that, shipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That\\r\\n      was it!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of the\\r\\n      living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from Gospel\\r\\n      duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed\\r\\n      them into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal! Woe\\r\\n      to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe to him who, in\\r\\n      this world, courts not dishonor! Woe to him who would not be true, even\\r\\n      though to be false were salvation! Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot\\r\\n      Paul has it, while preaching to others is himself a castaway!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his face\\r\\n      to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with a\\r\\n      heavenly enthusiasm,&mdash;&ldquo;But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of\\r\\n      every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight,\\r\\n      than the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the main-truck higher than the\\r\\n      kelson is low? Delight is to him&mdash;a far, far upward, and inward\\r\\n      delight&mdash;who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth,\\r\\n      ever stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong\\r\\n      arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has\\r\\n      gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the\\r\\n      truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from\\r\\n      under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,&mdash;top-gallant delight\\r\\n      is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is\\r\\n      only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the\\r\\n      billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure\\r\\n      Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his, who\\r\\n      coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath&mdash;O Father!&mdash;chiefly\\r\\n      known to me by Thy rod&mdash;mortal or immortal, here I die. I have\\r\\n      striven to be Thine, more than to be this world&rsquo;s, or mine own. Yet this\\r\\n      is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is man that he should live\\r\\n      out the lifetime of his God?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with\\r\\n      his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed, and\\r\\n      he was left alone in the place.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0010\" id=\"link2HCH0010\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 10. A Bosom Friend.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there quite\\r\\n      alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time. He was\\r\\n      sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove hearth, and\\r\\n      in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of\\r\\n      his; peering hard into its face, and with a jack-knife gently whittling\\r\\n      away at its nose, meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going to\\r\\n      the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap began\\r\\n      counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth page&mdash;as\\r\\n      I fancied&mdash;stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and giving\\r\\n      utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He would then\\r\\n      begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number one each\\r\\n      time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was only by\\r\\n      such a large number of fifties being found together, that his astonishment\\r\\n      at the multitude of pages was excited.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      With much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and hideously\\r\\n      marred about the face&mdash;at least to my taste&mdash;his countenance yet\\r\\n      had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You cannot hide\\r\\n      the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces\\r\\n      of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and\\r\\n      bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils.\\r\\n      And besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan,\\r\\n      which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim. He looked like a man\\r\\n      who had never cringed and never had had a creditor. Whether it was, too,\\r\\n      that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and\\r\\n      brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would, this I\\r\\n      will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was\\r\\n      phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded\\r\\n      me of General Washington&rsquo;s head, as seen in the popular busts of him. It\\r\\n      had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows,\\r\\n      which were likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly\\r\\n      wooded on top. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be\\r\\n      looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my presence,\\r\\n      never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but appeared\\r\\n      wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book.\\r\\n      Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous,\\r\\n      and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown over me\\r\\n      upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference of his very\\r\\n      strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do not know exactly\\r\\n      how to take them. At first they are overawing; their calm\\r\\n      self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had noticed\\r\\n      also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the\\r\\n      other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to have no\\r\\n      desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this struck me as\\r\\n      mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost\\r\\n      sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the\\r\\n      way of Cape Horn, that is&mdash;which was the only way he could get there&mdash;thrown\\r\\n      among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter;\\r\\n      and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the utmost serenity;\\r\\n      content with his own companionship; always equal to himself. Surely this\\r\\n      was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there\\r\\n      was such a thing as that. But, perhaps, to be true philosophers, we\\r\\n      mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving. So soon as I\\r\\n      hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher, I\\r\\n      conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he must have &ldquo;broken his\\r\\n      digester.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that mild\\r\\n      stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then only\\r\\n      glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the\\r\\n      casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the storm\\r\\n      booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of strange\\r\\n      feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart and maddened\\r\\n      hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing savage had\\r\\n      redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a nature in\\r\\n      which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits. Wild he\\r\\n      was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to feel myself\\r\\n      mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that would have\\r\\n      repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus drew me. I&rsquo;ll\\r\\n      try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but\\r\\n      hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some friendly signs\\r\\n      and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At first he little\\r\\n      noticed these advances; but presently, upon my referring to his last\\r\\n      night&rsquo;s hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be\\r\\n      bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased, perhaps a\\r\\n      little complimented.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to him\\r\\n      the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures that were\\r\\n      in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we went to\\r\\n      jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in\\r\\n      this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and, producing his pouch\\r\\n      and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And then we sat exchanging\\r\\n      puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it regularly passing between\\r\\n      us.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan&rsquo;s\\r\\n      breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and left\\r\\n      us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I\\r\\n      to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead against mine,\\r\\n      clasped me round the waist, and said that henceforth we were married;\\r\\n      meaning, in his country&rsquo;s phrase, that we were bosom friends; he would\\r\\n      gladly die for me, if need should be. In a countryman, this sudden flame\\r\\n      of friendship would have seemed far too premature, a thing to be much\\r\\n      distrusted; but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room\\r\\n      together. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his enormous\\r\\n      tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some thirty\\r\\n      dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and mechanically\\r\\n      dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them towards me, and\\r\\n      said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he silenced me by\\r\\n      pouring them into my trowsers&rsquo; pockets. I let them stay. He then went\\r\\n      about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed the paper\\r\\n      fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious for\\r\\n      me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a\\r\\n      moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible\\r\\n      Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in\\r\\n      worshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you\\r\\n      suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth&mdash;pagans\\r\\n      and all included&mdash;can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of\\r\\n      black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?&mdash;to do the will of God&mdash;<i>that</i>\\r\\n      is worship. And what is the will of God?&mdash;to do to my fellow man what\\r\\n      I would have my fellow man to do to me&mdash;<i>that</i> is the will of God. Now,\\r\\n      Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do\\r\\n      to me? Why, unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship.\\r\\n      Consequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn\\r\\n      idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent little\\r\\n      idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before him twice or\\r\\n      thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and went to bed, at\\r\\n      peace with our own consciences and all the world. But we did not go to\\r\\n      sleep without some little chat.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential\\r\\n      disclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the very\\r\\n      bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often lie and\\r\\n      chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our hearts&rsquo;\\r\\n      honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg&mdash;a cosy, loving pair.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0011\" id=\"link2HCH0011\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 11. Nightgown.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and\\r\\n      Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over\\r\\n      mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free and easy\\r\\n      were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what little\\r\\n      nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like getting\\r\\n      up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position began\\r\\n      to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up;\\r\\n      the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the head-board with our\\r\\n      four knees drawn up close together, and our two noses bending over them,\\r\\n      as if our kneepans were warming-pans. We felt very nice and snug, the more\\r\\n      so since it was so chilly out of doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too,\\r\\n      seeing that there was no fire in the room. The more so, I say, because\\r\\n      truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for\\r\\n      there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by\\r\\n      contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If you flatter yourself that you are\\r\\n      all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be\\r\\n      said to be comfortable any more. But if, like Queequeg and me in the bed,\\r\\n      the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled, why\\r\\n      then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and\\r\\n      unmistakably warm. For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be\\r\\n      furnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the\\r\\n      rich. For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but\\r\\n      the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air.\\r\\n      Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic\\r\\n      crystal.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at\\r\\n      once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether by\\r\\n      day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always\\r\\n      keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of\\r\\n      being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except\\r\\n      his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our\\r\\n      essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey part. Upon opening\\r\\n      my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and self-created darkness\\r\\n      into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated\\r\\n      twelve-o&rsquo;clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable revulsion. Nor did I\\r\\n      at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to\\r\\n      strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a\\r\\n      strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk. Be it said,\\r\\n      that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed\\r\\n      the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love\\r\\n      once comes to bend them. For now I liked nothing better than to have\\r\\n      Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such\\r\\n      serene household joy then. I no more felt unduly concerned for the\\r\\n      landlord&rsquo;s policy of insurance. I was only alive to the condensed\\r\\n      confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real\\r\\n      friend. With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed\\r\\n      the Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue\\r\\n      hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far\\r\\n      distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island; and,\\r\\n      eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He gladly\\r\\n      complied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his\\r\\n      words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar with\\r\\n      his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story such as\\r\\n      it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0012\" id=\"link2HCH0012\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 12. Biographical.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and\\r\\n      South. It is not down in any map; true places never are.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a\\r\\n      grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green\\r\\n      sapling; even then, in Queequeg&rsquo;s ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire\\r\\n      to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two. His\\r\\n      father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and on the\\r\\n      maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable\\r\\n      warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins&mdash;royal stuff; though\\r\\n      sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his\\r\\n      untutored youth.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      A Sag Harbor ship visited his father&rsquo;s bay, and Queequeg sought a passage\\r\\n      to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of seamen,\\r\\n      spurned his suit; and not all the King his father&rsquo;s influence could\\r\\n      prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled off to a\\r\\n      distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted\\r\\n      the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a low tongue of\\r\\n      land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water. Hiding\\r\\n      his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with its prow seaward, he\\r\\n      sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the ship was gliding\\r\\n      by, like a flash he darted out; gained her side; with one backward dash of\\r\\n      his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains; and throwing\\r\\n      himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and\\r\\n      swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a cutlass\\r\\n      over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and Queequeg budged\\r\\n      not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his wild desire to visit\\r\\n      Christendom, the captain at last relented, and told him he might make\\r\\n      himself at home. But this fine young savage&mdash;this sea Prince of\\r\\n      Wales, never saw the Captain&rsquo;s cabin. They put him down among the sailors,\\r\\n      and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter content to toil in the\\r\\n      shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if\\r\\n      thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored\\r\\n      countrymen. For at bottom&mdash;so he told me&mdash;he was actuated by a\\r\\n      profound desire to learn among the Christians, the arts whereby to make\\r\\n      his people still happier than they were; and more than that, still better\\r\\n      than they were. But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him\\r\\n      that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked; infinitely more\\r\\n      so, than all his father&rsquo;s heathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and\\r\\n      seeing what the sailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and\\r\\n      seeing how they spent their wages in <i>that</i> place also, poor Queequeg gave\\r\\n      it up for lost. Thought he, it&rsquo;s a wicked world in all meridians; I&rsquo;ll die\\r\\n      a pagan.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians,\\r\\n      wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer\\r\\n      ways about him, though now some time from home.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having a\\r\\n      coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he being\\r\\n      very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not yet; and\\r\\n      added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians, had unfitted\\r\\n      him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings\\r\\n      before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,&mdash;as soon as he\\r\\n      felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he proposed to sail\\r\\n      about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They had made a\\r\\n      harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future\\r\\n      movements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon\\r\\n      this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my\\r\\n      intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port for\\r\\n      an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to accompany\\r\\n      me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same watch,\\r\\n      the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my every hap; with\\r\\n      both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds. To all\\r\\n      this I joyously assented; for besides the affection I now felt for\\r\\n      Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not fail to\\r\\n      be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant of the\\r\\n      mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as known to\\r\\n      merchant seamen.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      His story being ended with his pipe&rsquo;s last dying puff, Queequeg embraced\\r\\n      me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the light, we\\r\\n      rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon were\\r\\n      sleeping.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0013\" id=\"link2HCH0013\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 13. Wheelbarrow.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber,\\r\\n      for a block, I settled my own and comrade&rsquo;s bill; using, however, my\\r\\n      comrade&rsquo;s money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed\\r\\n      amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me\\r\\n      and Queequeg&mdash;especially as Peter Coffin&rsquo;s cock and bull stories\\r\\n      about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person\\r\\n      whom I now companied with.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own poor\\r\\n      carpet-bag, and Queequeg&rsquo;s canvas sack and hammock, away we went down to\\r\\n      &ldquo;the Moss,&rdquo; the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf. As\\r\\n      we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so much&mdash;for\\r\\n      they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets,&mdash;but at\\r\\n      seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we heeded them not,\\r\\n      going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg now and then\\r\\n      stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I asked him why he\\r\\n      carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and whether all whaling\\r\\n      ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in substance, he replied,\\r\\n      that though what I hinted was true enough, yet he had a particular\\r\\n      affection for his own harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried\\r\\n      in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales. In\\r\\n      short, like many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmers&rsquo;\\r\\n      meadows armed with their own scythes&mdash;though in no wise obliged to\\r\\n      furnish them&mdash;even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons,\\r\\n      preferred his own harpoon.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about\\r\\n      the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The owners\\r\\n      of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his heavy chest\\r\\n      to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the thing&mdash;though\\r\\n      in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in which to manage\\r\\n      the barrow&mdash;Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it fast; and then\\r\\n      shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Queequeg,\\r\\n      you might have known better than that, one would think. Didn&rsquo;t the people\\r\\n      laugh?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of Rokovoko,\\r\\n      it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young\\r\\n      cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and this\\r\\n      punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where\\r\\n      the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at\\r\\n      Rokovoko, and its commander&mdash;from all accounts, a very stately\\r\\n      punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain&mdash;this commander was\\r\\n      invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg&rsquo;s sister, a pretty young princess\\r\\n      just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding guests were assembled at\\r\\n      the bride&rsquo;s bamboo cottage, this Captain marches in, and being assigned\\r\\n      the post of honor, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between\\r\\n      the High Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg&rsquo;s father. Grace being\\r\\n      said,&mdash;for those people have their grace as well as we&mdash;though\\r\\n      Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such times look downwards to our\\r\\n      platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks, glance upwards to the\\r\\n      great Giver of all feasts&mdash;Grace, I say, being said, the High Priest\\r\\n      opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island; that is,\\r\\n      dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the\\r\\n      blessed beverage circulates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and\\r\\n      noting the ceremony, and thinking himself&mdash;being Captain of a ship&mdash;as\\r\\n      having plain precedence over a mere island King, especially in the King&rsquo;s\\r\\n      own house&mdash;the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the\\r\\n      punchbowl;&mdash;taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said\\r\\n      Queequeg, &ldquo;what you tink now?&mdash;Didn&rsquo;t our people laugh?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner.\\r\\n      Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one side, New Bedford\\r\\n      rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all glittering in the\\r\\n      clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled\\r\\n      upon her wharves, and side by side the world-wandering whale ships lay\\r\\n      silent and safely moored at last; while from others came a sound of\\r\\n      carpenters and coopers, with blended noises of fires and forges to melt\\r\\n      the pitch, all betokening that new cruises were on the start; that one\\r\\n      most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second\\r\\n      ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever and for aye. Such is the\\r\\n      endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little\\r\\n      Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his snortings.\\r\\n      How I snuffed that Tartar air!&mdash;how I spurned that turnpike earth!&mdash;that\\r\\n      common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs;\\r\\n      and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no\\r\\n      records.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me. His\\r\\n      dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed teeth. On,\\r\\n      on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the blast;\\r\\n      ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan. Sideways leaning,\\r\\n      we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire; the two tall\\r\\n      masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes. So full of this\\r\\n      reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that for some\\r\\n      time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a\\r\\n      lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so\\r\\n      companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a\\r\\n      whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by\\r\\n      their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all\\r\\n      verdure. Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind\\r\\n      his back. I thought the bumpkin&rsquo;s hour of doom was come. Dropping his\\r\\n      harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost\\r\\n      miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air;\\r\\n      then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with\\r\\n      bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his back upon him,\\r\\n      lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Capting! Capting!&rdquo; yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;\\r\\n      &ldquo;Capting, Capting, here&rsquo;s the devil.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Hallo, <i>you</i> sir,&rdquo; cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea,\\r\\n      stalking up to Queequeg, &ldquo;what in thunder do you mean by that? Don&rsquo;t you\\r\\n      know you might have killed that chap?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What him say?&rdquo; said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He say,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that you came near kill-e that man there,&rdquo; pointing to\\r\\n      the still shivering greenhorn.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Kill-e,&rdquo; cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly\\r\\n      expression of disdain, &ldquo;ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e so\\r\\n      small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Look you,&rdquo; roared the Captain, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill-e <i>you</i>, you cannibal, if you try\\r\\n      any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to\\r\\n      mind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted the\\r\\n      weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side,\\r\\n      completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor fellow\\r\\n      whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all hands were\\r\\n      in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed\\r\\n      madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in one ticking\\r\\n      of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into\\r\\n      splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of being done;\\r\\n      those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it\\r\\n      were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the midst of this\\r\\n      consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under\\r\\n      the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the\\r\\n      bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the\\r\\n      boom as it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that\\r\\n      way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was run into the wind, and\\r\\n      while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to\\r\\n      the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap. For\\r\\n      three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing his long\\r\\n      arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders\\r\\n      through the freezing foam. I looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but\\r\\n      saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself\\r\\n      perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now took an instant&rsquo;s glance\\r\\n      around him, and seeming to see just how matters were, dived down and\\r\\n      disappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again, one arm still striking\\r\\n      out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked\\r\\n      them up. The poor bumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble\\r\\n      trump; the captain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg\\r\\n      like a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Was there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he at\\r\\n      all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He only\\r\\n      asked for water&mdash;fresh water&mdash;something to wipe the brine off;\\r\\n      that done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against\\r\\n      the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to\\r\\n      himself&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We\\r\\n      cannibals must help these Christians.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0014\" id=\"link2HCH0014\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 14. Nantucket.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a\\r\\n      fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of the\\r\\n      world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely than\\r\\n      the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it&mdash;a mere hillock, and elbow of\\r\\n      sand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than you\\r\\n      would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some\\r\\n      gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they\\r\\n      don&rsquo;t grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have to\\r\\n      send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that pieces of\\r\\n      wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome;\\r\\n      that people there plant toadstools before their houses, to get under the\\r\\n      shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an oasis, three blades\\r\\n      in a day&rsquo;s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes, something like\\r\\n      Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up, belted about, every way\\r\\n      inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island of by the ocean, that to\\r\\n      their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering,\\r\\n      as to the backs of sea turtles. But these extravaganzas only show that\\r\\n      Nantucket is no Illinois.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled\\r\\n      by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle swooped down\\r\\n      upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant Indian in his\\r\\n      talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight\\r\\n      over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the same direction.\\r\\n      Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage they discovered the\\r\\n      island, and there they found an empty ivory casket,&mdash;the poor little\\r\\n      Indian&rsquo;s skeleton.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take\\r\\n      to the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs in the\\r\\n      sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more\\r\\n      experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,\\r\\n      launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;\\r\\n      put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at\\r\\n      Behring&rsquo;s Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting\\r\\n      war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood; most\\r\\n      monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea Mastodon,\\r\\n      clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very\\r\\n      panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious\\r\\n      assaults!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from\\r\\n      their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like so\\r\\n      many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and\\r\\n      Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America add\\r\\n      Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English overswarm all\\r\\n      India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun; two thirds of this\\r\\n      terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer&rsquo;s. For the sea is his; he owns it,\\r\\n      as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a right of way through\\r\\n      it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but floating\\r\\n      forts; even pirates and privateers, though following the sea as highwaymen\\r\\n      the road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of the land like\\r\\n      themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep\\r\\n      itself. The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea; he alone,\\r\\n      in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro ploughing it as\\r\\n      his own special plantation. <i>There</i> is his home; <i>there</i> lies his business,\\r\\n      which a Noah&rsquo;s flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the\\r\\n      millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie;\\r\\n      he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the\\r\\n      Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at\\r\\n      last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to\\r\\n      an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and\\r\\n      is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out\\r\\n      of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under\\r\\n      his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0015\" id=\"link2HCH0015\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 15. Chowder.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to\\r\\n      anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business\\r\\n      that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the\\r\\n      Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots,\\r\\n      whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in\\r\\n      all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he\\r\\n      called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that\\r\\n      we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the\\r\\n      directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our\\r\\n      starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then\\r\\n      keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to\\r\\n      the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the\\r\\n      place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first,\\r\\n      especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse&mdash;our\\r\\n      first point of departure&mdash;must be left on the larboard hand, whereas\\r\\n      I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, by\\r\\n      dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a\\r\\n      peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something\\r\\n      which there was no mistaking.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses&rsquo; ears,\\r\\n      swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old\\r\\n      doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so\\r\\n      that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was\\r\\n      over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help\\r\\n      staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my\\r\\n      neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, <i>two</i> of them, one for\\r\\n      Queequeg, and one for me. It&rsquo;s ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper\\r\\n      upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the\\r\\n      whalemen&rsquo;s chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots\\r\\n      too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with\\r\\n      yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a\\r\\n      dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and\\r\\n      carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Get along with ye,&rdquo; said she to the man, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll be combing ye!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Come on, Queequeg,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;all right. There&rsquo;s Mrs. Hussey.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs.\\r\\n      Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon making known\\r\\n      our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further\\r\\n      scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at\\r\\n      a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned\\r\\n      round to us and said&mdash;&ldquo;Clam or Cod?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that about Cods, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; said I, with much politeness.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Clam or Cod?&rdquo; she repeated.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;A clam for supper? a cold clam; is <i>that</i> what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?&rdquo; says\\r\\n      I, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time,\\r\\n      ain&rsquo;t it, Mrs. Hussey?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt,\\r\\n      who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the\\r\\n      word &ldquo;clam,&rdquo; Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the\\r\\n      kitchen, and bawling out &ldquo;clam for two,&rdquo; disappeared.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Queequeg,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do you think that we can make out a supper for us\\r\\n      both on one clam?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the\\r\\n      apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder\\r\\n      came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!\\r\\n      hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than\\r\\n      hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into\\r\\n      little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned\\r\\n      with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage,\\r\\n      and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him,\\r\\n      and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great\\r\\n      expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey&rsquo;s\\r\\n      clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment.\\r\\n      Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word &ldquo;cod&rdquo; with great\\r\\n      emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam came\\r\\n      forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine\\r\\n      cod-chowder was placed before us.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to\\r\\n      myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What&rsquo;s that\\r\\n      stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? &ldquo;But look, Queequeg, ain&rsquo;t\\r\\n      that a live eel in your bowl? Where&rsquo;s your harpoon?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its\\r\\n      name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for\\r\\n      breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began\\r\\n      to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before the\\r\\n      house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of\\r\\n      codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior\\r\\n      old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could\\r\\n      not at all account for, till one morning happening to take a stroll along\\r\\n      the beach among some fishermen&rsquo;s boats, I saw Hosea&rsquo;s brindled cow feeding\\r\\n      on fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod&rsquo;s\\r\\n      decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey\\r\\n      concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede\\r\\n      me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his\\r\\n      harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;every\\r\\n      true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon&mdash;but why not?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s\\r\\n      dangerous,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort&rsquo;nt\\r\\n      v&rsquo;y&rsquo;ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with only three\\r\\n      barrels of <i>ile</i>, was found dead in my first floor back, with his\\r\\n      harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich\\r\\n      dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg&rdquo; (for she had\\r\\n      learned his name), &ldquo;I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you\\r\\n      till morning.

But to my surprise and no\\r\\n      small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been\\r\\n      diligently consulting Yojo&mdash;the name of his black little god&mdash;and\\r\\n      Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it\\r\\n      everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in\\r\\n      harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo\\r\\n      earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with\\r\\n      me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to do so, had\\r\\n      already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael,\\r\\n      should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned\\r\\n      out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the\\r\\n      present irrespective of Queequeg.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great\\r\\n      confidence in the excellence of Yojo&rsquo;s judgment and surprising forecast of\\r\\n      things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort\\r\\n      of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did\\r\\n      not succeed in his benevolent designs.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, this plan of Queequeg&rsquo;s, or rather Yojo&rsquo;s, touching the selection of\\r\\n      our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon\\r\\n      Queequeg&rsquo;s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and\\r\\n      our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon\\r\\n      Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set\\r\\n      about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor,\\r\\n      that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning\\r\\n      early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom&mdash;for\\r\\n      it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting,\\r\\n      humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; <i>how</i> it was I\\r\\n      never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I\\r\\n      never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles&mdash;leaving\\r\\n      Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at\\r\\n      his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After\\r\\n      much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there\\r\\n      were three ships up for three-years&rsquo; voyages&mdash;The Devil-dam, the\\r\\n      Tit-bit, and the Pequod. <i>Devil-Dam</i>, I do not know the origin of; <i>Tit-bit</i>\\r\\n      is obvious; <i>Pequod</i>, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a\\r\\n      celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient\\r\\n      Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to\\r\\n      the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for\\r\\n      a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;&mdash;square-toed\\r\\n      luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not;\\r\\n      but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same\\r\\n      rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if\\r\\n      anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned\\r\\n      and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old\\r\\n      hull&rsquo;s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier&rsquo;s, who has alike\\r\\n      fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts&mdash;cut\\r\\n      somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost\\r\\n      overboard in a gale&mdash;her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of\\r\\n      the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled,\\r\\n      like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where\\r\\n      Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and\\r\\n      marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than\\r\\n      half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her\\r\\n      chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a\\r\\n      retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,&mdash;this\\r\\n      old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her\\r\\n      original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of\\r\\n      material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake&rsquo;s\\r\\n      carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian\\r\\n      emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing\\r\\n      of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased\\r\\n      bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were\\r\\n      garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm\\r\\n      whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons\\r\\n      to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly\\r\\n      travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her\\r\\n      reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one\\r\\n      mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary\\r\\n      foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the\\r\\n      Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble\\r\\n      craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched with\\r\\n      that.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority,\\r\\n      in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw\\r\\n      nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather\\r\\n      wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary\\r\\n      erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high;\\r\\n      consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the\\r\\n      middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale. Planted with their\\r\\n      broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together, mutually\\r\\n      sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where\\r\\n      the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old\\r\\n      Pottowottamie Sachem&rsquo;s head. A triangular opening faced towards the bows\\r\\n      of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by\\r\\n      his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the\\r\\n      ship&rsquo;s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of\\r\\n      command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over\\r\\n      with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout\\r\\n      interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the\\r\\n      elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and\\r\\n      heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there\\r\\n      was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles\\r\\n      interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual\\r\\n      sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;&mdash;for\\r\\n      this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together. Such\\r\\n      eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Is this the Captain of the Pequod?&rdquo; said I, advancing to the door of the\\r\\n      tent.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?&rdquo;\\r\\n       he demanded.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I was thinking of shipping.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer&mdash;ever been in a\\r\\n      stove boat?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;No, Sir, I never have.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say&mdash;eh?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I&rsquo;ve been several\\r\\n      voyages in the merchant service, and I think that&mdash;&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg?&mdash;I&rsquo;ll\\r\\n      take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant\\r\\n      service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel\\r\\n      considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships. But flukes!\\r\\n      man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?&mdash;it looks a little\\r\\n      suspicious, don&rsquo;t it, eh?&mdash;Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?&mdash;Didst\\r\\n      not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?&mdash;Dost not think of murdering\\r\\n      the officers when thou gettest to sea?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of\\r\\n      these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish\\r\\n      Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of\\r\\n      all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of\\r\\n      shipping ye.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Who is Captain Ahab, sir?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg&mdash;that&rsquo;s who ye are speaking to,\\r\\n      young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted\\r\\n      out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We\\r\\n      are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to\\r\\n      know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of\\r\\n      finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye\\r\\n      on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed\\r\\n      up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!&mdash;ah,\\r\\n      ah!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the\\r\\n      hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could,\\r\\n      &ldquo;What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there was\\r\\n      any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have\\r\\n      inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d&rsquo;ye see; thou dost\\r\\n      not talk shark a bit. <i>Sure</i>, ye&rsquo;ve been to sea before now; sure of that?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the\\r\\n      merchant&mdash;&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service&mdash;don&rsquo;t\\r\\n      aggravate me&mdash;I won&rsquo;t have it. But let us understand each other. I\\r\\n      have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for\\r\\n      it?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I do, sir.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale&rsquo;s\\r\\n      throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be\\r\\n      got rid of, that is; which I don&rsquo;t take to be the fact.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out\\r\\n      by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the\\r\\n      world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step\\r\\n      forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me\\r\\n      and tell me what ye see there.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing\\r\\n      exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But\\r\\n      concentrating all his crow&rsquo;s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me\\r\\n      on the errand.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship\\r\\n      swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing\\r\\n      towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly\\r\\n      monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the report?&rdquo; said Peleg when I came back; &ldquo;what did ye see?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; I replied&mdash;&ldquo;nothing but water; considerable horizon\\r\\n      though, and there&rsquo;s a squall coming up, I think.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go\\r\\n      round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can&rsquo;t ye see the world where\\r\\n      you stand?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the\\r\\n      Pequod was as good a ship as any&mdash;I thought the best&mdash;and all\\r\\n      this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his\\r\\n      willingness to ship me.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,&rdquo; he added&mdash;&ldquo;come\\r\\n      along with ye.&rdquo; And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising\\r\\n      figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg\\r\\n      was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is\\r\\n      sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old\\r\\n      annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning\\r\\n      about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in\\r\\n      the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the\\r\\n      same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good\\r\\n      interest.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker,\\r\\n      the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day\\r\\n      its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities\\r\\n      of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things\\r\\n      altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the\\r\\n      most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting\\r\\n      Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture\\r\\n      names&mdash;a singularly common fashion on the island&mdash;and in\\r\\n      childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the\\r\\n      Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure\\r\\n      of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown\\r\\n      peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a\\r\\n      Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things\\r\\n      unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain\\r\\n      and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many\\r\\n      long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations\\r\\n      never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and\\r\\n      independently; receiving all nature&rsquo;s sweet or savage impressions fresh\\r\\n      from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly,\\r\\n      but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous\\r\\n      lofty language&mdash;that man makes one in a whole nation&rsquo;s census&mdash;a\\r\\n      mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all\\r\\n      detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other\\r\\n      circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at\\r\\n      the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through\\r\\n      a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal\\r\\n      greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one,\\r\\n      but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only\\r\\n      results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual\\r\\n      circumstances.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But\\r\\n      unlike Captain Peleg&mdash;who cared not a rush for what are called\\r\\n      serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the\\r\\n      veriest of all trifles&mdash;Captain Bildad had not only been originally\\r\\n      educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all\\r\\n      his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island\\r\\n      creatures, round the Horn&mdash;all that had not moved this native born\\r\\n      Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest.\\r\\n      Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common\\r\\n      consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from\\r\\n      conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself\\r\\n      had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe\\r\\n      to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns\\r\\n      upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his\\r\\n      days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do\\r\\n      not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he\\r\\n      had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man&rsquo;s\\r\\n      religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This world\\r\\n      pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the\\r\\n      drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from\\r\\n      that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship\\r\\n      owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by\\r\\n      wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty, and\\r\\n      dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned\\r\\n      income.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\\r\\n      incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\\r\\n      task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\\r\\n      curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,\\r\\n      upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore\\r\\n      exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was\\r\\n      certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear,\\r\\n      though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity\\r\\n      of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate,\\r\\n      to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made you feel\\r\\n      completely nervous, till you could clutch something&mdash;a hammer or a\\r\\n      marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind\\r\\n      what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own person was the\\r\\n      exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he\\r\\n      carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft,\\r\\n      economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\\r\\n      followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks\\r\\n      was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and\\r\\n      never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was placed\\r\\n      beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned\\r\\n      up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from\\r\\n      a ponderous volume.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Bildad,&rdquo; cried Captain Peleg, &ldquo;at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been\\r\\n      studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain\\r\\n      knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad,\\r\\n      without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing\\r\\n      me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He says he&rsquo;s our man, Bildad,&rdquo; said Peleg, &ldquo;he wants to ship.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Dost thee?&rdquo; said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I <i>dost</i>,&rdquo; said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What do ye think of him, Bildad?&rdquo; said Peleg.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his\\r\\n      book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his\\r\\n      friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only\\r\\n      looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth\\r\\n      the ship&rsquo;s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at\\r\\n      a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at\\r\\n      what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already\\r\\n      aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands,\\r\\n      including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called <i>lays</i>,\\r\\n      and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance\\r\\n      pertaining to the respective duties of the ship&rsquo;s company. I was also\\r\\n      aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very\\r\\n      large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship,\\r\\n      splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I\\r\\n      should be offered at least the 275th lay&mdash;that is, the 275th part of\\r\\n      the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually\\r\\n      amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather <i>long lay</i>,\\r\\n      yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty\\r\\n      nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my\\r\\n      three years&rsquo; beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\\r\\n      fortune&mdash;and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those\\r\\n      that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the\\r\\n      world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim\\r\\n      sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay\\r\\n      would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I\\r\\n      been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\\r\\n      receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard\\r\\n      something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;\\r\\n      how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the\\r\\n      other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole\\r\\n      management of the ship&rsquo;s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what\\r\\n      the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping\\r\\n      hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home\\r\\n      there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now\\r\\n      while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old\\r\\n      Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an\\r\\n      interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on\\r\\n      mumbling to himself out of his book, &ldquo;<i>Lay</i> not up for yourselves treasures\\r\\n      upon earth, where moth&mdash;&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Well, Captain Bildad,&rdquo; interrupted Peleg, &ldquo;what d&rsquo;ye say, what lay shall\\r\\n      we give this young man?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Thou knowest best,&rdquo; was the sepulchral reply, &ldquo;the seven hundred and\\r\\n      seventy-seventh wouldn&rsquo;t be too much, would it?&mdash;&lsquo;where moth and rust\\r\\n      do corrupt, but <i>lay</i>&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <i>Lay</i>, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\\r\\n      seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,\\r\\n      shall not <i>lay</i> up many <i>lays</i> here below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It\\r\\n      was an exceedingly <i>long lay</i> that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of\\r\\n      the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest\\r\\n      consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a\\r\\n      pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a <i>teenth</i> of it, you will\\r\\n      then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a\\r\\n      farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold\\r\\n      doubloons; and so I thought at the time.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,&rdquo; cried Peleg, &ldquo;thou dost not want to\\r\\n      swindle this young man! he must have more than that.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,&rdquo; again said Bildad, without lifting\\r\\n      his eyes; and then went on mumbling&mdash;&ldquo;for where your treasure is,\\r\\n      there will your heart be also.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,&rdquo; said Peleg, &ldquo;do ye\\r\\n      hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, &ldquo;Captain\\r\\n      Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou\\r\\n      owest to the other owners of this ship&mdash;widows and orphans, many of\\r\\n      them&mdash;and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young\\r\\n      man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The\\r\\n      seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Thou Bildad!&rdquo; roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin.\\r\\n      &ldquo;Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters,\\r\\n      I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough\\r\\n      to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Captain Peleg,&rdquo; said Bildad steadily, &ldquo;thy conscience may be drawing ten\\r\\n      inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can&rsquo;t tell; but as thou art still an\\r\\n      impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a\\r\\n      leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit,\\r\\n      Captain Peleg.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye\\r\\n      insult me. It&rsquo;s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he&rsquo;s\\r\\n      bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and start\\r\\n      my soul-bolts, but I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;ll swallow a live goat\\r\\n      with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting,\\r\\n      drab-coloured son of a wooden gun&mdash;a straight wake with ye!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous\\r\\n      oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\\r\\n      responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all\\r\\n      idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\\r\\n      commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I\\r\\n      made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath\\r\\n      of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very\\r\\n      quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing. He\\r\\n      seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after\\r\\n      letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he,\\r\\n      too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still\\r\\n      nervously agitated. &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he whistled at last&mdash;&ldquo;the squall&rsquo;s gone\\r\\n      off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a\\r\\n      lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone.\\r\\n      That&rsquo;s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael&rsquo;s thy name,\\r\\n      didn&rsquo;t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three\\r\\n      hundredth lay.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Captain Peleg,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have a friend with me who wants to ship too&mdash;shall\\r\\n      I bring him down to-morrow?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said Peleg. &ldquo;Fetch him along, and we&rsquo;ll look at him.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What lay does he want?&rdquo; groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in\\r\\n      which he had again been burying himself.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,&rdquo; said Peleg. &ldquo;Has he ever whaled\\r\\n      it any?&rdquo; turning to me.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Well, bring him along then.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had\\r\\n      done a good morning&rsquo;s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship\\r\\n      that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain\\r\\n      with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many\\r\\n      cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her\\r\\n      crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take\\r\\n      command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore\\r\\n      intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family,\\r\\n      or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself\\r\\n      much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till all is\\r\\n      ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at him before\\r\\n      irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted\\r\\n      Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It&rsquo;s all right enough; thou art\\r\\n      shipped.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Yes, but I should like to see him.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don&rsquo;t know exactly\\r\\n      what&rsquo;s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of\\r\\n      sick, and yet he don&rsquo;t look so. In fact, he ain&rsquo;t sick; but no, he isn&rsquo;t\\r\\n      well either. Any how, young man, he won&rsquo;t always see me, so I don&rsquo;t\\r\\n      suppose he will thee. He&rsquo;s a queer man, Captain Ahab&mdash;so some think&mdash;but\\r\\n      a good one. Oh, thou&rsquo;lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He&rsquo;s a\\r\\n      grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn&rsquo;t speak much; but, when\\r\\n      he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab&rsquo;s\\r\\n      above the common; Ahab&rsquo;s been in colleges, as well as &rsquo;mong the cannibals;\\r\\n      been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in\\r\\n      mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the\\r\\n      surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain&rsquo;t Captain Bildad; no, and he\\r\\n      ain&rsquo;t Captain Peleg; <i>he&rsquo;s Ahab</i>, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a\\r\\n      crowned king!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they\\r\\n      not lick his blood?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Come hither to me&mdash;hither, hither,&rdquo; said Peleg, with a significance\\r\\n      in his eye that almost startled me. &ldquo;Look ye, lad; never say that on board\\r\\n      the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself.\\r\\n      &rsquo;Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when\\r\\n      he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead,\\r\\n      said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other\\r\\n      fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It&rsquo;s a lie. I\\r\\n      know Captain Ahab well; I&rsquo;ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know\\r\\n      what he is&mdash;a good man&mdash;not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but\\r\\n      a swearing good man&mdash;something like me&mdash;only there&rsquo;s a good deal\\r\\n      more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know\\r\\n      that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but\\r\\n      it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that\\r\\n      about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg\\r\\n      last voyage by that accursed whale, he&rsquo;s been a kind of moody&mdash;desperate\\r\\n      moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all,\\r\\n      let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it&rsquo;s better to sail with a\\r\\n      moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee&mdash;and\\r\\n      wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides,\\r\\n      my boy, he has a wife&mdash;not three voyages wedded&mdash;a sweet,\\r\\n      resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child:\\r\\n      hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my\\r\\n      lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been incidentally\\r\\n      revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain wild vagueness of\\r\\n      painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time, I felt a sympathy\\r\\n      and a sorrow for him, but for I don&rsquo;t know what, unless it was the cruel\\r\\n      loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange awe of him; but that sort\\r\\n      of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was not exactly awe; I do not know\\r\\n      what it was. But I felt it; and it did not disincline me towards him;\\r\\n      though I felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him, so\\r\\n      imperfectly as he was known to me then. However, my thoughts were at\\r\\n      length carried in other directions, so that for the present dark Ahab\\r\\n      slipped my mind.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0017\" id=\"link2HCH0017\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 17. The Ramadan.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As Queequeg&rsquo;s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all\\r\\n      day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I\\r\\n      cherish the greatest respect towards everybody&rsquo;s religious obligations,\\r\\n      never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue\\r\\n      even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other\\r\\n      creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of footmanism\\r\\n      quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the torso of a\\r\\n      deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions\\r\\n      yet owned and rented in his name.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these\\r\\n      things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,\\r\\n      pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these\\r\\n      subjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most absurd\\r\\n      notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;&mdash;but what of that? Queequeg\\r\\n      thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content; and\\r\\n      there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail; let him be,\\r\\n      I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all&mdash;Presbyterians and Pagans\\r\\n      alike&mdash;for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and\\r\\n      sadly need mending.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals\\r\\n      must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door; but no\\r\\n      answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside. &ldquo;Queequeg,&rdquo; said I\\r\\n      softly through the key-hole:&mdash;all silent. &ldquo;I say, Queequeg! why don&rsquo;t\\r\\n      you speak? It&rsquo;s I&mdash;Ishmael.&rdquo; But all remained still as before. I\\r\\n      began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant time; I thought he\\r\\n      might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked through the key-hole; but the\\r\\n      door opening into an odd corner of the room, the key-hole prospect was but\\r\\n      a crooked and sinister one. I could only see part of the foot-board of the\\r\\n      bed and a line of the wall, but nothing more. I was surprised to behold\\r\\n      resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg&rsquo;s harpoon, which the\\r\\n      landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting to\\r\\n      the chamber. That&rsquo;s strange, thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon\\r\\n      stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he\\r\\n      must be inside here, and no possible mistake.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Queequeg!&mdash;Queequeg!&rdquo;&mdash;all still. Something must have happened.\\r\\n      Apoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.\\r\\n      Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person I\\r\\n      met&mdash;the chamber-maid. &ldquo;La! la!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I thought something must\\r\\n      be the matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was\\r\\n      locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it&rsquo;s been just so silent ever\\r\\n      since. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your\\r\\n      baggage in for safe keeping. La! la, ma&rsquo;am!&mdash;Mistress! murder! Mrs.\\r\\n      Hussey! apoplexy!&rdquo;&mdash;and with these cries, she ran towards the\\r\\n      kitchen, I following.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a\\r\\n      vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation of\\r\\n      attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy meantime.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Wood-house!&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;which way to it? Run for God&rsquo;s sake, and fetch\\r\\n      something to pry open the door&mdash;the axe!&mdash;the axe! he&rsquo;s had a\\r\\n      stroke; depend upon it!&rdquo;&mdash;and so saying I was unmethodically rushing\\r\\n      up stairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot\\r\\n      and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, young man?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Get the axe! For God&rsquo;s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I pry it\\r\\n      open!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet, so\\r\\n      as to have one hand free; &ldquo;look here; are you talking about prying open\\r\\n      any of my doors?&rdquo;&mdash;and with that she seized my arm. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the\\r\\n      matter with you? What&rsquo;s the matter with you, shipmate?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand the\\r\\n      whole case. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of her\\r\\n      nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;No! I haven&rsquo;t\\r\\n      seen it since I put it there.&rdquo; Running to a little closet under the\\r\\n      landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that\\r\\n      Queequeg&rsquo;s harpoon was missing. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s killed himself,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s\\r\\n      unfort&rsquo;nate Stiggs done over again&mdash;there goes another counterpane&mdash;God\\r\\n      pity his poor mother!&mdash;it will be the ruin of my house. Has the poor\\r\\n      lad a sister? Where&rsquo;s that girl?&mdash;there, Betty, go to Snarles the\\r\\n      Painter, and tell him to paint me a sign, with&mdash;&ldquo;no suicides\\r\\n      permitted here, and no smoking in the parlor;&rdquo;&mdash;might as well kill\\r\\n      both birds at once. Kill? The Lord be merciful to his ghost! What&rsquo;s that\\r\\n      noise there? You, young man, avast there!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force open\\r\\n      the door.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t allow it; I won&rsquo;t have my premises spoiled. Go for the locksmith,\\r\\n      there&rsquo;s one about a mile from here. But avast!&rdquo; putting her hand in her\\r\\n      side-pocket, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a key that&rsquo;ll fit, I guess; let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo; And with\\r\\n      that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas! Queequeg&rsquo;s supplemental bolt\\r\\n      remained unwithdrawn within.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Have to burst it open,&rdquo; said I, and was running down the entry a little,\\r\\n      for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing I should\\r\\n      not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a sudden bodily\\r\\n      rush dashed myself full against the mark.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming against\\r\\n      the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good heavens! there\\r\\n      sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right in the middle of\\r\\n      the room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on top of his head. He\\r\\n      looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat like a carved image with\\r\\n      scarce a sign of active life.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Queequeg,&rdquo; said I, going up to him, &ldquo;Queequeg, what&rsquo;s the matter with\\r\\n      you?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He hain&rsquo;t been a sittin&rsquo; so all day, has he?&rdquo; said the landlady.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt like\\r\\n      pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost\\r\\n      intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;\\r\\n      especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of\\r\\n      eight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Mrs. Hussey,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s <i>alive</i> at all events; so leave us, if you\\r\\n      please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg\\r\\n      to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could do&mdash;for\\r\\n      all my polite arts and blandishments&mdash;he would not move a peg, nor\\r\\n      say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in the\\r\\n      slightest way.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do\\r\\n      they fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so; yes,\\r\\n      it&rsquo;s part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he&rsquo;ll get up\\r\\n      sooner or later, no doubt. It can&rsquo;t last for ever, thank God, and his\\r\\n      Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s very punctual\\r\\n      then.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long\\r\\n      stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as\\r\\n      they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig,\\r\\n      confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after\\r\\n      listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock, I went up\\r\\n      stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must\\r\\n      certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there he was\\r\\n      just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began to grow\\r\\n      vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting\\r\\n      there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room, holding a\\r\\n      piece of wood on his head.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and have\\r\\n      some supper. You&rsquo;ll starve; you&rsquo;ll kill yourself, Queequeg.&rdquo; But not a\\r\\n      word did he reply.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep; and\\r\\n      no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to\\r\\n      turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as it\\r\\n      promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary\\r\\n      round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not get into the\\r\\n      faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere thought of\\r\\n      Queequeg&mdash;not four feet off&mdash;sitting there in that uneasy\\r\\n      position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched.\\r\\n      Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan\\r\\n      on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of\\r\\n      day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he had\\r\\n      been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of sun\\r\\n      entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but with a\\r\\n      cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his forehead again\\r\\n      against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person&rsquo;s religion, be\\r\\n      it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any other\\r\\n      person, because that other person don&rsquo;t believe it also. But when a man&rsquo;s\\r\\n      religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment to him;\\r\\n      and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in;\\r\\n      then I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the\\r\\n      point with him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And just so I now did with Queequeg. &ldquo;Queequeg,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;get into bed\\r\\n      now, and lie and listen to me.&rdquo; I then went on, beginning with the rise\\r\\n      and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various\\r\\n      religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show\\r\\n      Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in\\r\\n      cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health; useless for\\r\\n      the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common\\r\\n      sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such an extremely\\r\\n      sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see\\r\\n      him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.\\r\\n      Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves\\r\\n      in; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved. This\\r\\n      is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy\\r\\n      notions about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg, said I, rather\\r\\n      digressively; hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling;\\r\\n      and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by\\r\\n      Ramadans.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia;\\r\\n      expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it in. He said no;\\r\\n      only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great feast given by his\\r\\n      father the king, on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the\\r\\n      enemy had been killed by about two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and all\\r\\n      cooked and eaten that very evening.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;No more, Queequeg,&rdquo; said I, shuddering; &ldquo;that will do;&rdquo; for I knew the\\r\\n      inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who had\\r\\n      visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when a\\r\\n      great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the yard\\r\\n      or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were placed in great\\r\\n      wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with breadfruit and\\r\\n      cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths, were sent round with the\\r\\n      victor&rsquo;s compliments to all his friends, just as though these presents\\r\\n      were so many Christmas turkeys.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\\r\\n      impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed\\r\\n      dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered from his own\\r\\n      point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more than one third\\r\\n      understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and, finally, he no doubt\\r\\n      thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did. He\\r\\n      looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion, as\\r\\n      though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be\\r\\n      so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty\\r\\n      breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not make\\r\\n      much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the Pequod,\\r\\n      sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0018\" id=\"link2HCH0018\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 18. His Mark.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg\\r\\n      carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us\\r\\n      from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and\\r\\n      furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft,\\r\\n      unless they previously produced their papers.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?&rdquo; said I, now jumping on the\\r\\n      bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;he must show his papers.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from\\r\\n      behind Peleg&rsquo;s, out of the wigwam. &ldquo;He must show that he&rsquo;s converted. Son\\r\\n      of darkness,&rdquo; he added, turning to Queequeg, &ldquo;art thou at present in\\r\\n      communion with any Christian church?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a member of the first Congregational Church.&rdquo; Here be\\r\\n      it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last\\r\\n      come to be converted into the churches.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;First Congregational Church,&rdquo; cried Bildad, &ldquo;what! that worships in\\r\\n      Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman&rsquo;s meeting-house?&rdquo; and so saying, taking out his\\r\\n      spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief, and\\r\\n      putting them on very carefully, came out of the wigwam, and leaning\\r\\n      stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at Queequeg.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;How long hath he been a member?&rdquo; he then said, turning to me; &ldquo;not very\\r\\n      long, I rather guess, young man.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Peleg, &ldquo;and he hasn&rsquo;t been baptized right either, or it would\\r\\n      have washed some of that devil&rsquo;s blue off his face.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Do tell, now,&rdquo; cried Bildad, &ldquo;is this Philistine a regular member of\\r\\n      Deacon Deuteronomy&rsquo;s meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass it\\r\\n      every Lord&rsquo;s day.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,&rdquo; said I;\\r\\n      &ldquo;all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First\\r\\n      Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said Bildad sternly, &ldquo;thou art skylarking with me&mdash;explain\\r\\n      thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. &ldquo;I mean, sir, the same ancient\\r\\n      Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg\\r\\n      here, and all of us, and every mother&rsquo;s son and soul of us belong; the\\r\\n      great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world;\\r\\n      we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no\\r\\n      ways touching the grand belief; in <i>that</i> we all join hands.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Splice, thou mean&rsquo;st <i>splice</i> hands,&rdquo; cried Peleg, drawing nearer. &ldquo;Young\\r\\n      man, you&rsquo;d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast hand; I\\r\\n      never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy&mdash;why Father Mapple\\r\\n      himself couldn&rsquo;t beat it, and he&rsquo;s reckoned something. Come aboard, come\\r\\n      aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog there&mdash;what&rsquo;s\\r\\n      that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By the great anchor, what a\\r\\n      harpoon he&rsquo;s got there! looks like good stuff that; and he handles it\\r\\n      about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand\\r\\n      in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon the\\r\\n      bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to\\r\\n      the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his harpoon, cried\\r\\n      out in some such way as this:&mdash;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well,\\r\\n      spose him one whale eye, well, den!&rdquo; and taking sharp aim at it, he darted\\r\\n      the iron right over old Bildad&rsquo;s broad brim, clean across the ship&rsquo;s\\r\\n      decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, &ldquo;spos-ee him whale-e\\r\\n      eye; why, dad whale dead.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Quick, Bildad,&rdquo; said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close\\r\\n      vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangway.\\r\\n      &ldquo;Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship&rsquo;s papers. We must have\\r\\n      Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye, Quohog, we&rsquo;ll\\r\\n      give ye the ninetieth lay, and that&rsquo;s more than ever was given a\\r\\n      harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon\\r\\n      enrolled among the same ship&rsquo;s company to which I myself belonged.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for\\r\\n      signing, he turned to me and said, &ldquo;I guess, Quohog there don&rsquo;t know how\\r\\n      to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name or\\r\\n      make thy mark?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken part\\r\\n      in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the offered pen,\\r\\n      copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact counterpart of a\\r\\n      queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so that through\\r\\n      Captain Peleg&rsquo;s obstinate mistake touching his appellative, it stood\\r\\n      something like this:&mdash;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Quohog. his X mark.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg,\\r\\n      and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his\\r\\n      broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one\\r\\n      entitled &ldquo;The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,&rdquo; placed it in\\r\\n      Queequeg&rsquo;s hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,\\r\\n      looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, &ldquo;Son of darkness, I must do my\\r\\n      duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for the\\r\\n      souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways, which I\\r\\n      sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial bondsman. Spurn\\r\\n      the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind\\r\\n      thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery pit!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad&rsquo;s language,\\r\\n      heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,&rdquo;\\r\\n       cried Peleg. &ldquo;Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers&mdash;it takes the shark out of &rsquo;em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish.\\r\\n      There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out of all\\r\\n      Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never came to good.\\r\\n      He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered\\r\\n      away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case he got stove and went\\r\\n      to Davy Jones.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Peleg! Peleg!&rdquo; said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, &ldquo;thou thyself, as\\r\\n      I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what it is\\r\\n      to have the fear of death; how, then, can&rsquo;st thou prate in this ungodly\\r\\n      guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this same Pequod\\r\\n      here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan, that same\\r\\n      voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did&rsquo;st thou not think of\\r\\n      Death and the Judgment then?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Hear him, hear him now,&rdquo; cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and\\r\\n      thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,&mdash;&ldquo;hear him, all of ye.\\r\\n      Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death and\\r\\n      the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an everlasting\\r\\n      thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over us, fore and aft.\\r\\n      Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to think about Death\\r\\n      then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of; and how to save\\r\\n      all hands&mdash;how to rig jury-masts&mdash;how to get into the nearest\\r\\n      port; that was what I was thinking of.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where we\\r\\n      followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who\\r\\n      were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he stooped to pick up a\\r\\n      patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which otherwise might have been\\r\\n      wasted.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0019\" id=\"link2HCH0019\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 19.

A confluent small-pox had in all\\r\\n      directions flowed over his face, and left it like the complicated ribbed\\r\\n      bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried up.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Have ye shipped in her?&rdquo; he repeated.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,&rdquo; said I, trying to gain a little\\r\\n      more time for an uninterrupted look at him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, the Pequod&mdash;that ship there,&rdquo; he said, drawing back his whole\\r\\n      arm, and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed\\r\\n      bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we have just signed the articles.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Anything down there about your souls?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;About what?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oh, perhaps you hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got any,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;No matter though, I\\r\\n      know many chaps that hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got any,&mdash;good luck to &rsquo;em; and they are\\r\\n      all the better off for it. A soul&rsquo;s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What are you jabbering about, shipmate?&rdquo; said I.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s</i> got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in\\r\\n      other chaps,&rdquo; abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous emphasis upon\\r\\n      the word <i>he</i>.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Queequeg,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go; this fellow has broken loose from\\r\\n      somewhere; he&rsquo;s talking about something and somebody we don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried the stranger. &ldquo;Ye said true&mdash;ye hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t seen Old\\r\\n      Thunder yet, have ye?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Old Thunder?&rdquo; said I, again riveted with the insane earnestness of\\r\\n      his manner.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Captain Ahab.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t\\r\\n      seen him yet, have ye?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;No, we hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s sick they say, but is getting better, and will be\\r\\n      all right again before long.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;All right again before long!&rdquo; laughed the stranger, with a solemnly\\r\\n      derisive sort of laugh. &ldquo;Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then\\r\\n      this left arm of mine will be all right; not before.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What do you know about him?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What did they <i>tell</i> you about him? Say that!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t tell much of anything about him; only I&rsquo;ve heard that he&rsquo;s a\\r\\n      good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, that&rsquo;s true&mdash;yes, both true enough. But you must jump\\r\\n      when he gives an order. Step and growl; growl and go&mdash;that&rsquo;s the word\\r\\n      with Captain Ahab. But nothing about that thing that happened to him off\\r\\n      Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights;\\r\\n      nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in\\r\\n      Santa?&mdash;heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing about the silver\\r\\n      calabash he spat into? And nothing about his losing his leg last voyage,\\r\\n      according to the prophecy. Didn&rsquo;t ye hear a word about them matters and\\r\\n      something more, eh? No, I don&rsquo;t think ye did; how could ye? Who knows it?\\r\\n      Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows&rsquo;ever, mayhap, ye&rsquo;ve heard tell about\\r\\n      the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say. Oh\\r\\n      yes, <i>that</i> every one knows a&rsquo;most&mdash;I mean they know he&rsquo;s only one leg;\\r\\n      and that a parmacetti took the other off.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what all this gibberish of yours is about, I don&rsquo;t\\r\\n      know, and I don&rsquo;t much care; for it seems to me that you must be a little\\r\\n      damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab, of that ship\\r\\n      there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all about the loss of\\r\\n      his leg.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;<i>All</i> about it, eh&mdash;sure you do?&mdash;all?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Pretty sure.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like\\r\\n      stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a\\r\\n      little, turned and said:&mdash;&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve shipped, have ye? Names down on the\\r\\n      papers? Well, well, what&rsquo;s signed, is signed; and what&rsquo;s to be, will be;\\r\\n      and then again, perhaps it won&rsquo;t be, after all. Anyhow, it&rsquo;s all fixed and\\r\\n      arranged a&rsquo;ready; and some sailors or other must go with him, I suppose;\\r\\n      as well these as any other men, God pity &rsquo;em! Morning to ye, shipmates,\\r\\n      morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I&rsquo;m sorry I stopped ye.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Look here, friend,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you have anything important to tell us,\\r\\n      out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are mistaken\\r\\n      in your game; that&rsquo;s all I have to say.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way; you\\r\\n      are just the man for him&mdash;the likes of ye. Morning to ye, shipmates,\\r\\n      morning! Oh! when ye get there, tell &rsquo;em I&rsquo;ve concluded not to make one of\\r\\n      &rsquo;em.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Ah, my dear fellow, you can&rsquo;t fool us that way&mdash;you can&rsquo;t fool us.\\r\\n      It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a\\r\\n      great secret in him.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Morning to ye, shipmates, morning.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Morning it is,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Come along, Queequeg, let&rsquo;s leave this crazy\\r\\n      man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Elijah.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each other&rsquo;s\\r\\n      fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was nothing but a\\r\\n      humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had not gone perhaps above a\\r\\n      hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and looking back as I did\\r\\n      so, who should be seen but Elijah following us, though at a distance.\\r\\n      Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of\\r\\n      his being behind, but passed on with my comrade, anxious to see whether\\r\\n      the stranger would turn the same corner that we did. He did; and then it\\r\\n      seemed to me that he was dogging us, but with what intent I could not for\\r\\n      the life of me imagine. This circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous,\\r\\n      half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all\\r\\n      kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all connected with\\r\\n      the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn\\r\\n      fit; and the silver calabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when\\r\\n      I left the ship the day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig;\\r\\n      and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy\\r\\n      things.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really\\r\\n      dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg, and\\r\\n      on that side of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on, without\\r\\n      seeming to notice us. This relieved me; and once more, and finally as it\\r\\n      seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0020\" id=\"link2HCH0020\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 20. All Astir.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod. Not\\r\\n      only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on board,\\r\\n      and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything betokened\\r\\n      that the ship&rsquo;s preparations were hurrying to a close. Captain Peleg\\r\\n      seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp\\r\\n      look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing and providing at\\r\\n      the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were\\r\\n      working till long after night-fall.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      On the day following Queequeg&rsquo;s signing the articles, word was given at\\r\\n      all the inns where the ship&rsquo;s company were stopping, that their chests\\r\\n      must be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon the\\r\\n      vessel might be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps, resolving,\\r\\n      however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they always give very\\r\\n      long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail for several days.\\r\\n      But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and there is no telling\\r\\n      how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod was fully equipped.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Every one knows what a multitude of things&mdash;beds, sauce-pans, knives\\r\\n      and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are\\r\\n      indispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling, which\\r\\n      necessitates a three-years&rsquo; housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far from all\\r\\n      grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And though this also\\r\\n      holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means to the same extent as\\r\\n      with whalemen. For besides the great length of the whaling voyage, the\\r\\n      numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery, and the\\r\\n      impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented,\\r\\n      it must be remembered, that of all ships, whaling vessels are the most\\r\\n      exposed to accidents of all kinds, and especially to the destruction and\\r\\n      loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends.\\r\\n      Hence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare lines and harpoons, and\\r\\n      spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain and duplicate ship.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the\\r\\n      Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water, fuel,\\r\\n      and iron hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time there was\\r\\n      a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of\\r\\n      things, both large and small.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain Bildad&rsquo;s\\r\\n      sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit, but\\r\\n      withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if <i>she</i> could help it,\\r\\n      nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after once fairly getting\\r\\n      to sea. At one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the\\r\\n      steward&rsquo;s pantry; another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate&rsquo;s\\r\\n      desk, where he kept his log; a third time with a roll of flannel for the\\r\\n      small of some one&rsquo;s rheumatic back. Never did any woman better deserve her\\r\\n      name, which was Charity&mdash;Aunt Charity, as everybody called her. And\\r\\n      like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about\\r\\n      hither and thither, ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that\\r\\n      promised to yield safety, comfort, and consolation to all on board a ship\\r\\n      in which her beloved brother Bildad was concerned, and in which she\\r\\n      herself owned a score or two of well-saved dollars.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on\\r\\n      board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and a\\r\\n      still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor\\r\\n      Captain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him a\\r\\n      long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down went\\r\\n      his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a while Peleg\\r\\n      came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men down the\\r\\n      hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and then concluded\\r\\n      by roaring back into his wigwam.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the craft,\\r\\n      and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and when he was\\r\\n      going to come on board his ship. To these questions they would answer,\\r\\n      that he was getting better and better, and was expected aboard every day;\\r\\n      meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend to everything\\r\\n      necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I had been downright honest\\r\\n      with myself, I would have seen very plainly in my heart that I did but\\r\\n      half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage, without once\\r\\n      laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it, so\\r\\n      soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea. But when a man suspects any\\r\\n      wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter,\\r\\n      he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself. And\\r\\n      much this way it was with me. I said nothing, and tried to think nothing.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly\\r\\n      sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early start.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0021\" id=\"link2HCH0021\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 21. Going Aboard.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was nearly six o&rsquo;clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we\\r\\n      drew nigh the wharf.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,&rdquo; said I to\\r\\n      Queequeg, &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t be shadows; she&rsquo;s off by sunrise, I guess; come on!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Avast!&rdquo; cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind\\r\\n      us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself\\r\\n      between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight,\\r\\n      strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Going aboard?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Hands off, will you,&rdquo; said I.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Lookee here,&rdquo; said Queequeg, shaking himself, &ldquo;go &rsquo;way!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t going aboard, then?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Yes, we are,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but what business is that of yours? Do you know,\\r\\n      Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;No, no, no; I wasn&rsquo;t aware of that,&rdquo; said Elijah, slowly and wonderingly\\r\\n      looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable glances.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Elijah,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We are\\r\\n      going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be\\r\\n      detained.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s cracked, Queequeg,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;come on.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Holloa!&rdquo; cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few\\r\\n      paces.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Never mind him,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Queequeg, come on.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my\\r\\n      shoulder, said&mdash;&ldquo;Did ye see anything looking like men going towards\\r\\n      that ship a while ago?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, &ldquo;Yes, I\\r\\n      thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Very dim, very dim,&rdquo; said Elijah. &ldquo;Morning to ye.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and\\r\\n      touching my shoulder again, said, &ldquo;See if you can find &rsquo;em now, will ye?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Find who?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Morning to ye! morning to ye!&rdquo; he rejoined, again moving off. &ldquo;Oh! I was\\r\\n      going to warn ye against&mdash;but never mind, never mind&mdash;it&rsquo;s all\\r\\n      one, all in the family too;&mdash;sharp frost this morning, ain&rsquo;t it?\\r\\n      Good-bye to ye. Shan&rsquo;t see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it&rsquo;s before\\r\\n      the Grand Jury.&rdquo; And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving\\r\\n      me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound\\r\\n      quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the\\r\\n      hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward to\\r\\n      the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a light, we\\r\\n      went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a tattered\\r\\n      pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his face\\r\\n      downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber slept\\r\\n      upon him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?&rdquo; said I,\\r\\n      looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the wharf,\\r\\n      Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I would have\\r\\n      thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter, were it not\\r\\n      for Elijah&rsquo;s otherwise inexplicable question. But I beat the thing down;\\r\\n      and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps\\r\\n      we had best sit up with the body; telling him to establish himself\\r\\n      accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper&rsquo;s rear, as though feeling if\\r\\n      it was soft enough; and then, without more ado, sat quietly down there.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Gracious! Queequeg, don&rsquo;t sit there,&rdquo; said I.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oh! perry dood seat,&rdquo; said Queequeg, &ldquo;my country way; won&rsquo;t hurt him\\r\\n      face.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Face!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;call that his face? very benevolent countenance then; but\\r\\n      how hard he breathes, he&rsquo;s heaving himself; get off, Queequeg, you are\\r\\n      heavy, it&rsquo;s grinding the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look, he&rsquo;ll\\r\\n      twitch you off soon. I wonder he don&rsquo;t wake.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and\\r\\n      lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing\\r\\n      over the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning him\\r\\n      in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his land,\\r\\n      owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king, chiefs,\\r\\n      and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening some of the\\r\\n      lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house comfortably in that\\r\\n      respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them\\r\\n      round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was very convenient on an\\r\\n      excursion; much better than those garden-chairs which are convertible into\\r\\n      walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and desiring\\r\\n      him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps in some\\r\\n      damp marshy place.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk\\r\\n      from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper&rsquo;s head.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for, Queequeg?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,\\r\\n      which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed\\r\\n      his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The\\r\\n      strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole, it began to tell\\r\\n      upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed troubled in\\r\\n      the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and rubbed his\\r\\n      eyes.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Holloa!&rdquo; he breathed at last, &ldquo;who be ye smokers?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Shipped men,&rdquo; answered I, &ldquo;when does she sail?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain came\\r\\n      aboard last night.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What Captain?&mdash;Ahab?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Who but him indeed?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we\\r\\n      heard a noise on deck.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Holloa! Starbuck&rsquo;s astir,&rdquo; said the rigger. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a lively chief mate,\\r\\n      that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.&rdquo; And so\\r\\n      saying he went on deck, and we followed.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and threes;\\r\\n      the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively engaged; and\\r\\n      several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on\\r\\n      board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his\\r\\n      cabin.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0022\" id=\"link2HCH0022\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 22. Merry Christmas.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship&rsquo;s riggers,\\r\\n      and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and after the\\r\\n      ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with her last gift&mdash;a\\r\\n      night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her brother-in-law, and a spare\\r\\n      Bible for the steward&mdash;after all this, the two Captains, Peleg and\\r\\n      Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to the chief mate, Peleg said:\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is all\\r\\n      ready&mdash;just spoke to him&mdash;nothing more to be got from shore, eh?\\r\\n      Well, call all hands, then. Muster &rsquo;em aft here&mdash;blast &rsquo;em!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,&rdquo; said Bildad,\\r\\n      &ldquo;but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      How now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain\\r\\n      Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the\\r\\n      quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as well\\r\\n      as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of him\\r\\n      was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But then, the\\r\\n      idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship\\r\\n      under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed, as that was not at\\r\\n      all his proper business, but the pilot&rsquo;s; and as he was not yet completely\\r\\n      recovered&mdash;so they said&mdash;therefore, Captain Ahab stayed below.\\r\\n      And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the merchant service\\r\\n      many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after\\r\\n      heaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell\\r\\n      merry-making with their shore friends, before they quit the ship for good\\r\\n      with the pilot.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain Peleg\\r\\n      was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and commanding, and\\r\\n      not Bildad.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,&rdquo; he cried, as the sailors lingered at the\\r\\n      main-mast. &ldquo;Mr. Starbuck, drive &rsquo;em aft.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Strike the tent there!&rdquo;&mdash;was the next order. As I hinted before,\\r\\n      this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the\\r\\n      Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to\\r\\n      be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!&mdash;jump!&rdquo;&mdash;was the next\\r\\n      command, and the crew sprang for the handspikes.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot is\\r\\n      the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it\\r\\n      known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed pilots\\r\\n      of the port&mdash;he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in\\r\\n      order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned\\r\\n      in, for he never piloted any other craft&mdash;Bildad, I say, might now be\\r\\n      seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor,\\r\\n      and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody, to cheer\\r\\n      the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of a chorus about\\r\\n      the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good will. Nevertheless, not three\\r\\n      days previous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed\\r\\n      on board the Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and Charity, his\\r\\n      sister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seaman&rsquo;s berth.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped and\\r\\n      swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he would sink\\r\\n      the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I paused on my\\r\\n      handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the perils we\\r\\n      both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot. I was\\r\\n      comforting myself, however, with the thought that in pious Bildad might be\\r\\n      found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay;\\r\\n      when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and turning round, was\\r\\n      horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his\\r\\n      leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my first kick.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Spring,\\r\\n      thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don&rsquo;t ye spring, I\\r\\n      say, all of ye&mdash;spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red\\r\\n      whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I\\r\\n      say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!&rdquo; And so saying, he moved along\\r\\n      the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while\\r\\n      imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I, Captain\\r\\n      Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It was a\\r\\n      short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into night, we\\r\\n      found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose freezing spray\\r\\n      cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of teeth on the\\r\\n      bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white ivory tusks of\\r\\n      some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from the bows.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as the\\r\\n      old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost all\\r\\n      over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady notes\\r\\n      were heard,&mdash;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n<pre xml:space=\"preserve\">\\r\\n      <i>&ldquo;Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,\\r\\n         Stand dressed in living green.\\r\\n      So to the Jews old Canaan stood,\\r\\n         While Jordan rolled between.&rdquo;</i>\\r\\n</pre>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. They were\\r\\n      full of hope and fruition. Spite of this frigid winter night in the\\r\\n      boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there was\\r\\n      yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and meads and\\r\\n      glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the spring,\\r\\n      untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no\\r\\n      longer. The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging\\r\\n      alongside.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected at\\r\\n      this juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to depart, yet; very\\r\\n      loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage&mdash;beyond\\r\\n      both stormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned\\r\\n      dollars were invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate sailed as captain;\\r\\n      a man almost as old as he, once more starting to encounter all the terrors\\r\\n      of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful\\r\\n      of every interest to him,&mdash;poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the\\r\\n      deck with anxious strides; ran down into the cabin to speak another\\r\\n      farewell word there; again came on deck, and looked to windward; looked\\r\\n      towards the wide and endless waters, only bounded by the far-off unseen\\r\\n      Eastern Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft; looked right\\r\\n      and left; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling\\r\\n      a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and\\r\\n      holding up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as\\r\\n      much as to say, &ldquo;Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all his\\r\\n      philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern came\\r\\n      too near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck&mdash;now a\\r\\n      word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about\\r\\n      him,&mdash;&ldquo;Captain Bildad&mdash;come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the\\r\\n      main-yard there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now!\\r\\n      Careful, careful!&mdash;come, Bildad, boy&mdash;say your last. Luck to ye,\\r\\n      Starbuck&mdash;luck to ye, Mr. Stubb&mdash;luck to ye, Mr. Flask&mdash;good-bye\\r\\n      and good luck to ye all&mdash;and this day three years I&rsquo;ll have a hot\\r\\n      supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket. Hurrah and away!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,&rdquo; murmured old Bildad,\\r\\n      almost incoherently. &ldquo;I hope ye&rsquo;ll have fine weather now, so that Captain\\r\\n      Ahab may soon be moving among ye&mdash;a pleasant sun is all he needs, and\\r\\n      ye&rsquo;ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. Be careful in the\\r\\n      hunt, ye mates. Don&rsquo;t stave the boats needlessly, ye harpooneers; good\\r\\n      white cedar plank is raised full three per cent. within the year. Don&rsquo;t\\r\\n      forget your prayers, either. Mr. Starbuck, mind that cooper don&rsquo;t waste\\r\\n      the spare staves. Oh! the sail-needles are in the green locker! Don&rsquo;t\\r\\n      whale it too much a&rsquo; Lord&rsquo;s days, men; but don&rsquo;t miss a fair chance\\r\\n      either, that&rsquo;s rejecting Heaven&rsquo;s good gifts. Have an eye to the molasses\\r\\n      tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a little leaky, I thought. If ye touch at the\\r\\n      islands, Mr. Flask, beware of fornication. Good-bye, good-bye! Don&rsquo;t keep\\r\\n      that cheese too long down in the hold, Mr. Starbuck; it&rsquo;ll spoil. Be\\r\\n      careful with the butter&mdash;twenty cents the pound it was, and mind ye,\\r\\n      if&mdash;&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,&mdash;away!&rdquo; and with that,\\r\\n      Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a\\r\\n      screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave three\\r\\n      heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the lone\\r\\n      Atlantic.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0023\" id=\"link2HCH0023\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 23. The Lee Shore.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded\\r\\n      mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      When on that shivering winter&rsquo;s night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive\\r\\n      bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her helm\\r\\n      but Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the\\r\\n      man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years&rsquo; dangerous voyage,\\r\\n      could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term.\\r\\n      The land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest things are ever the\\r\\n      unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is\\r\\n      the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let me only say that it fared with him\\r\\n      as with the storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward\\r\\n      land. The port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is\\r\\n      safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that&rsquo;s\\r\\n      kind to our mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that\\r\\n      ship&rsquo;s direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land,\\r\\n      though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and through.\\r\\n      With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing, fights\\r\\n      &rsquo;gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks all the\\r\\n      lashed sea&rsquo;s landlessness again; for refuge&rsquo;s sake forlornly rushing into\\r\\n      peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Know ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally\\r\\n      intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid\\r\\n      effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the\\r\\n      wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous,\\r\\n      slavish shore?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless, indefinite\\r\\n      as God&mdash;so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be\\r\\n      ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For worm-like,\\r\\n      then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the terrible! is all\\r\\n      this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O Bulkington! Bear thee\\r\\n      grimly, demigod!

The Advocate.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling; and\\r\\n      as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen\\r\\n      as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I am all\\r\\n      anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby done to us\\r\\n      hunters of whales.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the\\r\\n      fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not accounted\\r\\n      on a level with what are called the liberal professions. If a stranger\\r\\n      were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society, it would but\\r\\n      slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were he presented to\\r\\n      the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation of the naval\\r\\n      officers he should append the initials S.W.F. (Sperm Whale Fishery) to his\\r\\n      visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed pre-eminently presuming\\r\\n      and ridiculous.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen,\\r\\n      is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a butchering\\r\\n      sort of business; and that when actively engaged therein, we are\\r\\n      surrounded by all manner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is true.\\r\\n      But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all\\r\\n      Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor. And as\\r\\n      for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon\\r\\n      be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown, and\\r\\n      which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship at\\r\\n      least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But even granting\\r\\n      the charge in question to be true; what disordered slippery decks of a\\r\\n      whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those\\r\\n      battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies&rsquo;\\r\\n      plaudits? And if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of\\r\\n      the soldier&rsquo;s profession; let me assure ye that many a veteran who has\\r\\n      freely marched up to a battery, would quickly recoil at the apparition of\\r\\n      the sperm whale&rsquo;s vast tail, fanning into eddies the air over his head.\\r\\n      For what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the\\r\\n      interlinked terrors and wonders of God!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it unwittingly\\r\\n      pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding adoration! for almost\\r\\n      all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn round the globe, burn, as\\r\\n      before so many shrines, to our glory!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of scales;\\r\\n      see what we whalemen are, and have been.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Why did the Dutch in De Witt&rsquo;s time have admirals of their whaling fleets?\\r\\n      Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit out whaling\\r\\n      ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some score or two of\\r\\n      families from our own island of Nantucket? Why did Britain between the\\r\\n      years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of Â£1,000,000?\\r\\n      And lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the\\r\\n      rest of the banded whalemen in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven\\r\\n      hundred vessels; manned by eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming\\r\\n      4,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth, at the time of sailing,\\r\\n      $20,000,000! and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped\\r\\n      harvest of $7,000,000. How comes all this, if there be not something\\r\\n      puissant in whaling?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But this is not the half; look again.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life,\\r\\n      point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty years\\r\\n      has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken in one\\r\\n      aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling. One way and\\r\\n      another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so\\r\\n      continuously momentous in their sequential issues, that whaling may well\\r\\n      be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves\\r\\n      pregnant from her womb. It would be a hopeless, endless task to catalogue\\r\\n      all these things. Let a handful suffice. For many years past the\\r\\n      whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least\\r\\n      known parts of the earth. She has explored seas and archipelagoes which\\r\\n      had no chart, where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed. If American and\\r\\n      European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors, let them\\r\\n      fire salutes to the honor and glory of the whale-ship, which originally\\r\\n      showed them the way, and first interpreted between them and the savages.\\r\\n      They may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions, your\\r\\n      Cooks, your Krusensterns; but I say that scores of anonymous Captains have\\r\\n      sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and greater than your Cook\\r\\n      and your Krusenstern. For in their succourless empty-handedness, they, in\\r\\n      the heathenish sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin\\r\\n      islands, battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his\\r\\n      marines and muskets would not willingly have dared. All that is made such\\r\\n      a flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the\\r\\n      life-time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers. Often, adventures which\\r\\n      Vancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men accounted unworthy of\\r\\n      being set down in the ship&rsquo;s common log. Ah, the world! Oh, the world!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,\\r\\n      scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe and\\r\\n      the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast. It\\r\\n      was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish\\r\\n      crown, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted, it might be\\r\\n      distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation\\r\\n      of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain, and the\\r\\n      establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      That great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was given\\r\\n      to the enlightened world by the whaleman. After its first blunder-born\\r\\n      discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned those shores as\\r\\n      pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched there. The whale-ship\\r\\n      is the true mother of that now mighty colony. Moreover, in the infancy of\\r\\n      the first Australian settlement, the emigrants were several times saved\\r\\n      from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale-ship luckily\\r\\n      dropping an anchor in their waters. The uncounted isles of all Polynesia\\r\\n      confess the same truth, and do commercial homage to the whale-ship, that\\r\\n      cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant, and in many cases\\r\\n      carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations. If that\\r\\n      double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the\\r\\n      whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due; for already she is on the\\r\\n      threshold.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no\\r\\n      Ã¦sthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to\\r\\n      shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet\\r\\n      every time.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you will\\r\\n      say.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <i>The whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler?</i> Who wrote\\r\\n      the first account of our Leviathan? Who but mighty Job! And who composed\\r\\n      the first narrative of a whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a prince than\\r\\n      Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen, took down the words from\\r\\n      Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those times! And who pronounced our\\r\\n      glowing eulogy in Parliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      True enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have no\\r\\n      good blood in their veins.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <i>No good blood in their veins?</i> They have something better than royal blood\\r\\n      there. The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel; afterwards,\\r\\n      by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of Nantucket, and the\\r\\n      ancestress to a long line of Folgers and harpooneers&mdash;all kith and\\r\\n      kin to noble Benjamin&mdash;this day darting the barbed iron from one side\\r\\n      of the world to the other.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <i>Whaling not respectable?</i> Whaling is imperial!

But after embattling his facts, an advocate who\\r\\n      should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell\\r\\n      eloquently upon his cause&mdash;such an advocate, would he not be\\r\\n      blameworthy?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even modern\\r\\n      ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is\\r\\n      gone through. There is a saltcellar of state, so called, and there may be\\r\\n      a castor of state. How they use the salt, precisely&mdash;who knows?\\r\\n      Certain I am, however, that a king&rsquo;s head is solemnly oiled at his\\r\\n      coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be, though, that they anoint\\r\\n      it with a view of making its interior run well, as they anoint machinery?\\r\\n      Much might be ruminated here, concerning the essential dignity of this\\r\\n      regal process, because in common life we esteem but meanly and\\r\\n      contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair, and palpably smells of that\\r\\n      anointing. In truth, a mature man who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally,\\r\\n      that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere. As a general\\r\\n      rule, he can&rsquo;t amount to much in his totality.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But the only thing to be considered here, is this&mdash;what kind of oil\\r\\n      is used at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar\\r\\n      oil, nor castor oil, nor bear&rsquo;s oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil.\\r\\n      What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured,\\r\\n      unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and queens\\r\\n      with coronation stuff!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0026\" id=\"link2HCH0026\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 26. Knights and Squires.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a\\r\\n      Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy\\r\\n      coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard\\r\\n      as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood would\\r\\n      not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time of general\\r\\n      drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which his state is\\r\\n      famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those summers had dried\\r\\n      up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his thinness, so to speak,\\r\\n      seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed\\r\\n      the indication of any bodily blight. It was merely the condensation of the\\r\\n      man. He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary. His pure tight\\r\\n      skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with\\r\\n      inner health and strength, like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck\\r\\n      seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come, and to endure always, as\\r\\n      now; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his\\r\\n      interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates. Looking into\\r\\n      his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those\\r\\n      thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life. A staid,\\r\\n      steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of\\r\\n      action, and not a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety\\r\\n      and fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times\\r\\n      affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest.\\r\\n      Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural\\r\\n      reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly\\r\\n      incline him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in\\r\\n      some organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than\\r\\n      from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And if\\r\\n      at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more did his\\r\\n      far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend\\r\\n      him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him\\r\\n      still further to those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted\\r\\n      men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in\\r\\n      the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. &ldquo;I will have no man in my\\r\\n      boat,&rdquo; said Starbuck, &ldquo;who is not afraid of a whale.&rdquo; By this, he seemed\\r\\n      to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which\\r\\n      arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an\\r\\n      utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, aye,&rdquo; said Stubb, the second mate, &ldquo;Starbuck, there, is as careful a\\r\\n      man as you&rsquo;ll find anywhere in this fishery.&rdquo; But we shall ere long see\\r\\n      what that word &ldquo;careful&rdquo; precisely means when used by a man like Stubb, or\\r\\n      almost any other whale hunter.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a sentiment;\\r\\n      but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all mortally\\r\\n      practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this business\\r\\n      of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship, like\\r\\n      her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly wasted. Wherefore he had\\r\\n      no fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down; nor for persisting in\\r\\n      fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him. For, thought\\r\\n      Starbuck, I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living,\\r\\n      and not to be killed by them for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been\\r\\n      so killed Starbuck well knew. What doom was his own father&rsquo;s? Where, in\\r\\n      the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain\\r\\n      superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which\\r\\n      could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But it\\r\\n      was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such\\r\\n      terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature that\\r\\n      these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him, which,\\r\\n      under suitable circumstances, would break out from its confinement, and\\r\\n      burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it was that sort of\\r\\n      bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which, while generally\\r\\n      abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the\\r\\n      ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand those more\\r\\n      terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you from\\r\\n      the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete\\r\\n      abasement of poor Starbuck&rsquo;s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart to\\r\\n      write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose the\\r\\n      fall of valour in the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint\\r\\n      stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be;\\r\\n      men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble and\\r\\n      so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any ignominious\\r\\n      blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes.\\r\\n      That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so far within us, that\\r\\n      it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone; bleeds with\\r\\n      keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man. Nor can\\r\\n      piety itself, at such a shameful sight, completely stifle her upbraidings\\r\\n      against the permitting stars. But this august dignity I treat of, is not\\r\\n      the dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which has no\\r\\n      robed investiture. Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick\\r\\n      or drives a spike; that democratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates\\r\\n      without end from God; Himself! The great God absolute! The centre and\\r\\n      circumference of all democracy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall\\r\\n      hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic\\r\\n      graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased, among them\\r\\n      all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall touch\\r\\n      that workman&rsquo;s arm with some ethereal light; if I shall spread a rainbow\\r\\n      over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics bear me\\r\\n      out in it, thou just Spirit of Equality, which hast spread one royal\\r\\n      mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear me out in it, thou great\\r\\n      democratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart convict, Bunyan, the\\r\\n      pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of\\r\\n      finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who didst\\r\\n      pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a\\r\\n      war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne! Thou who, in all\\r\\n      Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions from\\r\\n      the kingly commons; bear me out in it, O God!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0027\" id=\"link2HCH0027\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 27. Knights and Squires.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,\\r\\n      according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;\\r\\n      neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an indifferent\\r\\n      air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase, toiling\\r\\n      away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year.\\r\\n      Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his whale-boat as if\\r\\n      the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his crew all invited\\r\\n      guests. He was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part\\r\\n      of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box. When\\r\\n      close to the whale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he handled his\\r\\n      unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer.\\r\\n      He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the\\r\\n      most exasperated monster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the\\r\\n      jaws of death into an easy chair. What he thought of death itself, there\\r\\n      is no telling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question;\\r\\n      but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable\\r\\n      dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a sort of call of\\r\\n      the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there, about something\\r\\n      which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and not sooner.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going, unfearing\\r\\n      man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of\\r\\n      grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs; what helped to\\r\\n      bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that thing must have\\r\\n      been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black little pipe was one of\\r\\n      the regular features of his face. You would almost as soon have expected\\r\\n      him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe. He kept\\r\\n      a whole row of pipes there ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy\\r\\n      reach of his hand; and, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in\\r\\n      succession, lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter; then\\r\\n      loading them again to be in readiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed,\\r\\n      instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into\\r\\n      his mouth.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his\\r\\n      peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air, whether\\r\\n      ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the\\r\\n      numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in time of the\\r\\n      cholera, some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their\\r\\n      mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal tribulations, Stubb&rsquo;s tobacco\\r\\n      smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard. A\\r\\n      short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales, who\\r\\n      somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and\\r\\n      hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of honor\\r\\n      with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost was he to\\r\\n      all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and\\r\\n      mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible\\r\\n      danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous\\r\\n      whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat,\\r\\n      requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time\\r\\n      and trouble in order to kill and boil. This ignorant, unconscious\\r\\n      fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales; he\\r\\n      followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years&rsquo; voyage round\\r\\n      Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time. As a\\r\\n      carpenter&rsquo;s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails; so mankind\\r\\n      may be similarly divided. Little Flask was one of the wrought ones; made\\r\\n      to clinch tight and last long. They called him King-Post on board of the\\r\\n      Pequod; because, in form, he could be well likened to the short, square\\r\\n      timber known by that name in Arctic whalers; and which by the means of\\r\\n      many radiating side timbers inserted into it, serves to brace the ship\\r\\n      against the icy concussions of those battering seas.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now these three mates&mdash;Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous\\r\\n      men. They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the\\r\\n      Pequod&rsquo;s boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which Captain\\r\\n      Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales, these\\r\\n      three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being armed with their\\r\\n      long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers; even as\\r\\n      the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic\\r\\n      Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,\\r\\n      who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the\\r\\n      former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and\\r\\n      moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy\\r\\n      and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set down\\r\\n      who the Pequod&rsquo;s harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of them\\r\\n      belonged.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected for\\r\\n      his squire. But Queequeg is already known.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly\\r\\n      promontory of Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, where there still exists the last remnant\\r\\n      of a village of red men, which has long supplied the neighboring island of\\r\\n      Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers. In the fishery, they\\r\\n      usually go by the generic name of Gay-Headers. Tashtego&rsquo;s long, lean,\\r\\n      sable hair, his high cheek bones, and black rounding eyes&mdash;for an\\r\\n      Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but Antarctic in their glittering\\r\\n      expression&mdash;all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the\\r\\n      unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the\\r\\n      great New England moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests\\r\\n      of the main. But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the\\r\\n      woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea;\\r\\n      the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of\\r\\n      the sires. To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would\\r\\n      almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans,\\r\\n      and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers\\r\\n      of the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second mate&rsquo;s squire.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black\\r\\n      negro-savage, with a lion-like tread&mdash;an Ahasuerus to behold.\\r\\n      Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors\\r\\n      called them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards\\r\\n      to them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,\\r\\n      lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been anywhere\\r\\n      in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors most\\r\\n      frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold life of\\r\\n      the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of\\r\\n      men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a\\r\\n      giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his\\r\\n      socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a white\\r\\n      man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a\\r\\n      fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the\\r\\n      Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man beside him. As for the\\r\\n      residue of the Pequod&rsquo;s company, be it said, that at the present day not\\r\\n      one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the\\r\\n      American whale fishery, are Americans born, though pretty nearly all the\\r\\n      officers are. Herein it is the same with the American whale fishery as\\r\\n      with the American army and military and merchant navies, and the\\r\\n      engineering forces employed in the construction of the American Canals and\\r\\n      Railroads. The same, I say, because in all these cases the native American\\r\\n      liberally provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously\\r\\n      supplying the muscles. No small number of these whaling seamen belong to\\r\\n      the Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to\\r\\n      augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like\\r\\n      manner, the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the\\r\\n      Shetland Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the\\r\\n      passage homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no\\r\\n      telling, but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly\\r\\n      all Islanders in the Pequod, <i>Isolatoes</i> too, I call such, not acknowledging\\r\\n      the common continent of men, but each <i>Isolato</i> living on a separate\\r\\n      continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these\\r\\n      Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the\\r\\n      sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to\\r\\n      lay the world&rsquo;s grievances before that bar from which not very many of\\r\\n      them ever come back. Black Little Pip&mdash;he never did&mdash;oh, no! he\\r\\n      went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim Pequod&rsquo;s forecastle, ye shall\\r\\n      ere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time,\\r\\n      when sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in\\r\\n      with angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here,\\r\\n      hailed a hero there!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0028\" id=\"link2HCH0028\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 28. Ahab.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was seen\\r\\n      of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches,\\r\\n      and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the\\r\\n      only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from the cabin\\r\\n      with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was plain they but\\r\\n      commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and dictator was there,\\r\\n      though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now\\r\\n      sacred retreat of the cabin.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly gazed\\r\\n      aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague\\r\\n      disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the sea,\\r\\n      became almost a perturbation. This was strangely heightened at times by\\r\\n      the ragged Elijah&rsquo;s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me,\\r\\n      with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of. But poorly\\r\\n      could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile\\r\\n      at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves.\\r\\n      But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness&mdash;to call it so&mdash;which\\r\\n      I felt, yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed\\r\\n      against all warrantry to cherish such emotions. For though the\\r\\n      harpooneers, with the great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric,\\r\\n      heathenish, and motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies\\r\\n      which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with, still I\\r\\n      ascribed this&mdash;and rightly ascribed it&mdash;to the fierce uniqueness\\r\\n      of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so\\r\\n      abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the aspect of the three chief\\r\\n      officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly calculated to\\r\\n      allay these colourless misgivings, and induce confidence and cheerfulness\\r\\n      in every presentment of the voyage. Three better, more likely sea-officers\\r\\n      and men, each in his own different way, could not readily be found, and\\r\\n      they were every one of them Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape\\r\\n      man. Now, it being Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a\\r\\n      space we had biting Polar weather, though all the time running away from\\r\\n      it to the southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we\\r\\n      sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable\\r\\n      weather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey and\\r\\n      gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship\\r\\n      was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and\\r\\n      melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the\\r\\n      forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail,\\r\\n      foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension; Captain Ahab\\r\\n      stood upon his quarter-deck.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the\\r\\n      recovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when the\\r\\n      fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, or\\r\\n      taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His whole\\r\\n      high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an\\r\\n      unalterable mould, like Cellini&rsquo;s cast Perseus. Threading its way out from\\r\\n      among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his tawny\\r\\n      scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you saw a\\r\\n      slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that perpendicular\\r\\n      seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the\\r\\n      upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single\\r\\n      twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off\\r\\n      into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded. Whether\\r\\n      that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some\\r\\n      desperate wound, no one could certainly say. By some tacit consent,\\r\\n      throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it, especially by\\r\\n      the mates. But once Tashtego&rsquo;s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the\\r\\n      crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old\\r\\n      did Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the\\r\\n      fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild\\r\\n      hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an\\r\\n      old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had\\r\\n      never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old\\r\\n      sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old\\r\\n      Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no white sailor\\r\\n      seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should\\r\\n      be tranquilly laid out&mdash;which might hardly come to pass, so he\\r\\n      muttered&mdash;then, whoever should do that last office for the dead,\\r\\n      would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the livid\\r\\n      brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted\\r\\n      that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric\\r\\n      white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come to me that\\r\\n      this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the\\r\\n      sperm whale&rsquo;s jaw. &ldquo;Aye, he was dismasted off Japan,&rdquo; said the old\\r\\n      Gay-Head Indian once; &ldquo;but like his dismasted craft, he shipped another\\r\\n      mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of\\r\\n      the Pequod&rsquo;s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds, there\\r\\n      was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank. His\\r\\n      bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a shroud;\\r\\n      Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out beyond the ship&rsquo;s\\r\\n      ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest fortitude, a\\r\\n      determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless,\\r\\n      forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor did his\\r\\n      officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest gestures and\\r\\n      expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful, consciousness\\r\\n      of being under a troubled master-eye. And not only that, but moody\\r\\n      stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face; in all the\\r\\n      nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin. But\\r\\n      after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either standing\\r\\n      in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or heavily\\r\\n      walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to grow a\\r\\n      little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if, when the\\r\\n      ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the\\r\\n      sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it came to pass, that\\r\\n      he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet, for all that he said,\\r\\n      or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary\\r\\n      there as another mast. But the Pequod was only making a passage now; not\\r\\n      regularly cruising; nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision\\r\\n      the mates were fully competent to, so that there was little or nothing,\\r\\n      out of himself, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for\\r\\n      that one interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his\\r\\n      brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves\\r\\n      upon.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant,\\r\\n      holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him from his mood.\\r\\n      For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home to\\r\\n      the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest, most\\r\\n      thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts, to\\r\\n      welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did, in the end, a little\\r\\n      respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air. More than once did\\r\\n      he put forth the faint blossom of a look, which, in any other man, would\\r\\n      have soon flowered out in a smile.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0029\" id=\"link2HCH0029\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 29. Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went\\r\\n      rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost perpetually\\r\\n      reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic. The warmly\\r\\n      cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days, were as\\r\\n      crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped up&mdash;flaked up, with\\r\\n      rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in\\r\\n      jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride, the memory of their\\r\\n      absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted suns! For sleeping man, &rsquo;twas\\r\\n      hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights. But all\\r\\n      the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and\\r\\n      potencies to the outward world. Inward they turned upon the soul,\\r\\n      especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her\\r\\n      crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights. And all these\\r\\n      subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on Ahab&rsquo;s texture.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less\\r\\n      man has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders, the\\r\\n      old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked\\r\\n      deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he seemed so much to\\r\\n      live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits were more to the\\r\\n      cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. &ldquo;It feels like going down into\\r\\n      one&rsquo;s tomb,&rdquo;&mdash;he would mutter to himself&mdash;&ldquo;for an old captain\\r\\n      like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug\\r\\n      berth.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were\\r\\n      set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below; and\\r\\n      when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors flung it\\r\\n      not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt it to its\\r\\n      place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when this sort of\\r\\n      steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the silent steersman\\r\\n      would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man would emerge,\\r\\n      gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled way. Some considering\\r\\n      touch of humanity was in him; for at times like these, he usually\\r\\n      abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his wearied mates,\\r\\n      seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would have been\\r\\n      the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their dreams would\\r\\n      have been on the crunching teeth of sharks. But once, the mood was on him\\r\\n      too deep for common regardings; and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was\\r\\n      measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate,\\r\\n      came up from below, with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness,\\r\\n      hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one\\r\\n      could say nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting\\r\\n      something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the\\r\\n      insertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab\\r\\n      then.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,&rdquo; said Ahab, &ldquo;that thou wouldst wad me that\\r\\n      fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave; where\\r\\n      such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at last.&mdash;Down,\\r\\n      dog, and kennel!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly\\r\\n      scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly, &ldquo;I\\r\\n      am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half like\\r\\n      it, sir.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away, as\\r\\n      if to avoid some passionate temptation.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;No, sir; not yet,&rdquo; said Stubb, emboldened, &ldquo;I will not tamely be called a\\r\\n      dog, sir.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone, or\\r\\n      I&rsquo;ll clear the world of thee!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in\\r\\n      his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,&rdquo; muttered\\r\\n      Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very queer.\\r\\n      Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don&rsquo;t well know whether to go back and strike\\r\\n      him, or&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&mdash;down here on my knees and pray for him?\\r\\n      Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the first time\\r\\n      I ever <i>did</i> pray. It&rsquo;s queer; very queer; and he&rsquo;s queer too; aye, take him\\r\\n      fore and aft, he&rsquo;s about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How\\r\\n      he flashed at me!&mdash;his eyes like powder-pans! is he mad? Anyway\\r\\n      there&rsquo;s something on his mind, as sure as there must be something on a\\r\\n      deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours\\r\\n      out of the twenty-four; and he don&rsquo;t sleep then. Didn&rsquo;t that Dough-Boy,\\r\\n      the steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man&rsquo;s\\r\\n      hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the foot,\\r\\n      and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of\\r\\n      frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it? A hot old man! I\\r\\n      guess he&rsquo;s got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it&rsquo;s a kind of\\r\\n      Tic-Dolly-row they say&mdash;worse nor a toothache. Well, well; I don&rsquo;t\\r\\n      know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it. He&rsquo;s full of\\r\\n      riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every night, as\\r\\n      Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what&rsquo;s that for, I should like to know?\\r\\n      Who&rsquo;s made appointments with him in the hold? Ain&rsquo;t that queer, now? But\\r\\n      there&rsquo;s no telling, it&rsquo;s the old game&mdash;Here goes for a snooze. Damn\\r\\n      me, it&rsquo;s worth a fellow&rsquo;s while to be born into the world, if only to fall\\r\\n      right asleep. And now that I think of it, that&rsquo;s about the first thing\\r\\n      babies do, and that&rsquo;s a sort of queer, too. Damn me, but all things are\\r\\n      queer, come to think of &rsquo;em. But that&rsquo;s against my principles. Think not,\\r\\n      is my eleventh commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth&mdash;So\\r\\n      here goes again. But how&rsquo;s that? didn&rsquo;t he call me a dog? blazes! he\\r\\n      called me ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of <i>that!</i>\\r\\n      He might as well have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he <i>did</i> kick me,\\r\\n      and I didn&rsquo;t observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow.\\r\\n      It flashed like a bleached bone. What the devil&rsquo;s the matter with me? I\\r\\n      don&rsquo;t stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of\\r\\n      turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming, though&mdash;How?\\r\\n      how? how?&mdash;but the only way&rsquo;s to stash it; so here goes to hammock\\r\\n      again; and in the morning, I&rsquo;ll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over\\r\\n      by daylight.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0030\" id=\"link2HCH0030\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 30. The Pipe.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks;\\r\\n      and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor of the\\r\\n      watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also his pipe. Lighting\\r\\n      the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side\\r\\n      of the deck, he sat and smoked.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were\\r\\n      fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could one\\r\\n      look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without bethinking him\\r\\n      of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank, and a king of the\\r\\n      sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Some moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in\\r\\n      quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. &ldquo;How now,&rdquo;\\r\\n       he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, &ldquo;this smoking no longer\\r\\n      soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone! Here\\r\\n      have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring&mdash;aye, and\\r\\n      ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with such\\r\\n      nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were the\\r\\n      strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with this pipe?\\r\\n      This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white vapors\\r\\n      among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like mine. I&rsquo;ll\\r\\n      smoke no more&mdash;&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the\\r\\n      waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made.\\r\\n      With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0031\" id=\"link2HCH0031\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 31. Queen Mab.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man&rsquo;s ivory\\r\\n      leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back,\\r\\n      upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto!\\r\\n      Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But\\r\\n      what was still more curious, Flask&mdash;you know how curious all dreams\\r\\n      are&mdash;through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be\\r\\n      thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that\\r\\n      kick from Ahab. &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; thinks I, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the row? It&rsquo;s not a real leg,\\r\\n      only a false leg.&rsquo; And there&rsquo;s a mighty difference between a living thump\\r\\n      and a dead thump. That&rsquo;s what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty\\r\\n      times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. The living member&mdash;that\\r\\n      makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to myself all the\\r\\n      while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed\\r\\n      pyramid&mdash;so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I\\r\\n      say, I was thinking to myself, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s his leg now, but a cane&mdash;a\\r\\n      whalebone cane. Yes,&rsquo; thinks I, &lsquo;it was only a playful cudgelling&mdash;in\\r\\n      fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me&mdash;not a base kick. Besides,&rsquo;\\r\\n      thinks I, &lsquo;look at it once; why, the end of it&mdash;the foot part&mdash;what\\r\\n      a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me,\\r\\n      <i>there&rsquo;s</i> a devilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to a\\r\\n      point only.&rsquo; But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask. While I\\r\\n      was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old merman,\\r\\n      with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round.\\r\\n      &lsquo;What are you &rsquo;bout?&rsquo; says he. Slid! man, but I was frightened. Such a\\r\\n      phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was over the fright. &lsquo;What am I about?&rsquo;\\r\\n      says I at last. &lsquo;And what business is that of yours, I should like to\\r\\n      know, Mr. Humpback? Do <i>you</i> want a kick?&rsquo; By the lord, Flask, I had no\\r\\n      sooner said that, than he turned round his stern to me, bent over, and\\r\\n      dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout&mdash;what do you think, I\\r\\n      saw?&mdash;why thunder alive, man, his stern was stuck full of\\r\\n      marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on second thoughts, &lsquo;I guess I\\r\\n      won&rsquo;t kick you, old fellow.&rsquo; &lsquo;Wise Stubb,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;wise Stubb;&rsquo; and kept\\r\\n      muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney\\r\\n      hag. Seeing he wasn&rsquo;t going to stop saying over his &lsquo;wise Stubb, wise\\r\\n      Stubb,&rsquo; I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I\\r\\n      had only just lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, &lsquo;Stop that\\r\\n      kicking!&rsquo; &lsquo;Halloa,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the matter now, old fellow?&rsquo; &lsquo;Look ye\\r\\n      here,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;let&rsquo;s argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn&rsquo;t\\r\\n      he?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, he did,&rsquo; says I&mdash;&lsquo;right <i>here</i> it was.&rsquo; &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; says he&mdash;&lsquo;he\\r\\n      used his ivory leg, didn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, he did,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Well then,&rsquo; says\\r\\n      he, &lsquo;wise Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn&rsquo;t he kick with right\\r\\n      good will? it wasn&rsquo;t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No,\\r\\n      you were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.\\r\\n      It&rsquo;s an honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old\\r\\n      England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen,\\r\\n      and made garter-knights of; but, be <i>your</i> boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked\\r\\n      by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; <i>be</i> kicked by\\r\\n      him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back; for you can&rsquo;t\\r\\n      help yourself, wise Stubb. Don&rsquo;t you see that pyramid?&rsquo; With that, he all\\r\\n      of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into the\\r\\n      air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock! Now, what do\\r\\n      you think of that dream, Flask?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.&rsquo;&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;May be; may be. But it&rsquo;s made a wise man of me, Flask. D&rsquo;ye see Ahab\\r\\n      standing there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing you\\r\\n      can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him, whatever\\r\\n      he says. Halloa! What&rsquo;s that he shouts? Hark!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales hereabouts!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What do you think of that now, Flask? ain&rsquo;t there a small drop of\\r\\n      something queer about that, eh? A white whale&mdash;did ye mark that, man?\\r\\n      Look ye&mdash;there&rsquo;s something special in the wind. Stand by for it,\\r\\n      Flask. Ahab has that that&rsquo;s bloody on his mind. But, mum; he comes this\\r\\n      way.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0032\" id=\"link2HCH0032\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 32. Cetology.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost in\\r\\n      its unshored, harbourless immensities. Ere that come to pass; ere the\\r\\n      Pequod&rsquo;s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the\\r\\n      leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost\\r\\n      indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special\\r\\n      leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera, that\\r\\n      I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The\\r\\n      classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here\\r\\n      essayed. Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled\\r\\n      Cetology,&rdquo; says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry as\\r\\n      to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families. * * *\\r\\n      Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal&rdquo; (sperm whale),\\r\\n      says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.&rdquo;\\r\\n       &ldquo;Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.&rdquo; &ldquo;A field strewn\\r\\n      with thorns.&rdquo; &ldquo;All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us\\r\\n      naturalists.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson,\\r\\n      those lights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real\\r\\n      knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in some\\r\\n      small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. Many are the men,\\r\\n      small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at large or in\\r\\n      little, written of the whale. Run over a few:&mdash;The Authors of the\\r\\n      Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner; Ray;\\r\\n      LinnÃ¦us; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson;\\r\\n      Marten; LacÃ©pÃ¨de; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier;\\r\\n      John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne; the Author of\\r\\n      Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to what ultimate\\r\\n      generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited extracts will\\r\\n      show.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen ever\\r\\n      saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer\\r\\n      and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate subject of the\\r\\n      Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing authority. But Scoresby\\r\\n      knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale, compared with\\r\\n      which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning. And here be it\\r\\n      said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas.\\r\\n      He is not even by any means the largest of the whales. Yet, owing to the\\r\\n      long priority of his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some\\r\\n      seventy years back, invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown\\r\\n      sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all\\r\\n      but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been\\r\\n      every way complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in\\r\\n      the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale,\\r\\n      without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has\\r\\n      at last come for a new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good\\r\\n      people all,&mdash;the Greenland whale is deposed,&mdash;the great sperm\\r\\n      whale now reigneth!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living\\r\\n      sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree\\r\\n      succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale&rsquo;s and Bennett&rsquo;s; both in\\r\\n      their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and\\r\\n      reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in\\r\\n      their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of\\r\\n      excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific description. As\\r\\n      yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in\\r\\n      any literature. Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten\\r\\n      life.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive\\r\\n      classification, if only an easy outline one for the present, hereafter to\\r\\n      be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers. As no better man\\r\\n      advances to take this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor\\r\\n      endeavors. I promise nothing complete; because any human thing supposed to\\r\\n      be complete, must for that very reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not\\r\\n      pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species, or&mdash;in\\r\\n      this place at least&mdash;to much of any description. My object here is\\r\\n      simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology. I am the\\r\\n      architect, not the builder.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office\\r\\n      is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them; to\\r\\n      have one&rsquo;s hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis\\r\\n      of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I that I should essay to\\r\\n      hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful tauntings in Job might well\\r\\n      appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a covenant with thee? Behold the\\r\\n      hope of him is vain! But I have swam through libraries and sailed through\\r\\n      oceans; I have had to do with whales with these visible hands; I am in\\r\\n      earnest; and I will try. There are some preliminaries to settle.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is\\r\\n      in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it still\\r\\n      remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of Nature,\\r\\n      A.D. 1776, LinnÃ¦us declares, &ldquo;I hereby separate the whales from the\\r\\n      fish.&rdquo; But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850, sharks\\r\\n      and shad, alewives and herring, against LinnÃ¦us&rsquo;s express edict, were\\r\\n      still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The grounds upon which LinnÃ¦us would fain have banished the whales from\\r\\n      the waters, he states as follows: &ldquo;On account of their warm bilocular\\r\\n      heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem\\r\\n      intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,&rdquo; and finally, &ldquo;ex lege naturÃ¦ jure\\r\\n      meritoque.&rdquo; I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley\\r\\n      Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they\\r\\n      united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether\\r\\n      insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\\r\\n      ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me. This\\r\\n      fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect\\r\\n      does the whale differ from other fish. Above, LinnÃ¦us has given you those\\r\\n      items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood; whereas, all\\r\\n      other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\\r\\n      conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a\\r\\n      whale is <i>a spouting fish with a horizontal tail</i>. There you have him.\\r\\n      However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded meditation.\\r\\n      A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a fish, because\\r\\n      he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is still more\\r\\n      cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have noticed that\\r\\n      all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical, or\\r\\n      up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be\\r\\n      similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from\\r\\n      the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the\\r\\n      whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with\\r\\n      it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.* Hence, all the\\r\\n      smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this\\r\\n      ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the grand divisions of the entire\\r\\n      whale host.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      *I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and\\r\\n      Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included\\r\\n      by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a noisy,\\r\\n      contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on\\r\\n      wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as\\r\\n      whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom\\r\\n      of Cetology.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      First: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary BOOKS\\r\\n      (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them all, both\\r\\n      small and large.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As the type of the FOLIO I present the <i>Sperm Whale</i>; of the OCTAVO, the\\r\\n      <i>Grampus</i>; of the DUODECIMO, the <i>Porpoise</i>.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      FOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:&mdash;I. The\\r\\n      <i>Sperm Whale</i>; II. the <i>Right Whale</i>; III. the <i>Fin-Back Whale</i>; IV. the\\r\\n      <i>Hump-backed Whale</i>; V. the <i>Razor Back Whale</i>; VI. the <i>Sulphur Bottom Whale</i>.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>), CHAPTER I. (<i>Sperm Whale</i>).&mdash;This whale, among the\\r\\n      English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter whale,\\r\\n      and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the French, and the\\r\\n      Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words. He is,\\r\\n      without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of\\r\\n      all whales to encounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far\\r\\n      the most valuable in commerce; he being the only creature from which that\\r\\n      valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained. All his peculiarities will,\\r\\n      in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with his name that I\\r\\n      now have to do. Philologically considered, it is absurd. Some centuries\\r\\n      ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper\\r\\n      individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the\\r\\n      stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly\\r\\n      supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known\\r\\n      in England as the Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that\\r\\n      this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale\\r\\n      which the first syllable of the word literally expresses. In those times,\\r\\n      also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but\\r\\n      only as an ointment and medicament. It was only to be had from the\\r\\n      druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in\\r\\n      the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its\\r\\n      original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its\\r\\n      value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the\\r\\n      appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from\\r\\n      which this spermaceti was really derived.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>), CHAPTER II. (<i>Right Whale</i>).&mdash;In one respect this is\\r\\n      the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted\\r\\n      by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen; and\\r\\n      the oil specially known as &ldquo;whale oil,&rdquo; an inferior article in commerce.\\r\\n      Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by all the\\r\\n      following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale; the\\r\\n      Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a deal of obscurity\\r\\n      concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised. What\\r\\n      then is the whale, which I include in the second species of my Folios? It\\r\\n      is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of\\r\\n      the English whalemen; the Baleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the\\r\\n      Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for more than two\\r\\n      centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic\\r\\n      seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in\\r\\n      the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor&rsquo; West Coast, and various\\r\\n      other parts of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the\\r\\n      English and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree in\\r\\n      all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single\\r\\n      determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by\\r\\n      endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that\\r\\n      some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate. The\\r\\n      right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference to\\r\\n      elucidating the sperm whale.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>), CHAPTER III. (<i>Fin-Back</i>).&mdash;Under this head I reckon a\\r\\n      monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and\\r\\n      Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale\\r\\n      whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the\\r\\n      Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and in\\r\\n      his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less\\r\\n      portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great lips\\r\\n      present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds\\r\\n      of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which\\r\\n      he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some three\\r\\n      or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of\\r\\n      an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if not the\\r\\n      slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin will,\\r\\n      at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface. When the sea is\\r\\n      moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and this\\r\\n      gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it\\r\\n      may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat\\r\\n      resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that\\r\\n      Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He\\r\\n      seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very shy; always going\\r\\n      solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most\\r\\n      sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall\\r\\n      misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power\\r\\n      and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this\\r\\n      leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing\\r\\n      for his mark that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his\\r\\n      mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a\\r\\n      theoretic species denominated <i>Whalebone whales</i>, that is, whales with\\r\\n      baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be\\r\\n      several varieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed\\r\\n      whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed\\r\\n      whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen&rsquo;s names for a few sorts.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In connection with this appellative of &ldquo;Whalebone whales,&rdquo; it is of great\\r\\n      importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be convenient\\r\\n      in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to\\r\\n      attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon either his\\r\\n      baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those marked parts\\r\\n      or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a\\r\\n      regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions,\\r\\n      which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How then? The baleen, hump,\\r\\n      back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are\\r\\n      indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any regard\\r\\n      to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential\\r\\n      particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale, each has a\\r\\n      hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then, this same humpbacked whale\\r\\n      and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but there again the\\r\\n      similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the other parts above\\r\\n      mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such irregular\\r\\n      combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an\\r\\n      irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed\\r\\n      upon such a basis. On this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has\\r\\n      split.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the whale,\\r\\n      in his anatomy&mdash;there, at least, we shall be able to hit the right\\r\\n      classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the Greenland\\r\\n      whale&rsquo;s anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have seen that by\\r\\n      his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale. And\\r\\n      if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans, why there you\\r\\n      will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the\\r\\n      systematizer as those external ones already enumerated. What then remains?\\r\\n      nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, in their entire liberal\\r\\n      volume, and boldly sort them that way. And this is the Bibliographical\\r\\n      system here adopted; and it is the only one that can possibly succeed, for\\r\\n      it alone is practicable. To proceed.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>) CHAPTER IV. (<i>Hump Back</i>).&mdash;This whale is often seen on\\r\\n      the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there, and\\r\\n      towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or you might\\r\\n      call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the popular name for\\r\\n      him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the sperm whale also has\\r\\n      a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very valuable. He has baleen.\\r\\n      He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of all the whales, making more\\r\\n      gay foam and white water generally than any other of them.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>), CHAPTER V. (<i>Razor Back</i>).&mdash;Of this whale little is\\r\\n      known but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a\\r\\n      retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no\\r\\n      coward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which rises\\r\\n      in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor does\\r\\n      anybody else.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>), CHAPTER VI. (<i>Sulphur Bottom</i>).&mdash;Another retiring\\r\\n      gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the\\r\\n      Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen; at\\r\\n      least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and then\\r\\n      always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is never\\r\\n      chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are told of\\r\\n      him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true of ye, nor\\r\\n      can the oldest Nantucketer.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Thus ends BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>), and now begins BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>).\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      OCTAVOES.*&mdash;These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among\\r\\n      which present may be numbered:&mdash;I., the <i>Grampus</i>; II., the <i>Black Fish</i>;\\r\\n      III., the <i>Narwhale</i>; IV., the <i>Thrasher</i>; V., the <i>Killer</i>.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      *Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.\\r\\n      Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of the\\r\\n      former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in\\r\\n      figure, yet the bookbinder&rsquo;s Quarto volume in its dimensioned form does\\r\\n      not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume does.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>), CHAPTER I. (<i>Grampus</i>).&mdash;Though this fish, whose\\r\\n      loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to\\r\\n      landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not popularly\\r\\n      classed among whales. But possessing all the grand distinctive features of\\r\\n      the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised him for one. He is of\\r\\n      moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to twenty-five feet in length,\\r\\n      and of corresponding dimensions round the waist. He swims in herds; he is\\r\\n      never regularly hunted, though his oil is considerable in quantity, and\\r\\n      pretty good for light. By some fishermen his approach is regarded as\\r\\n      premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>), CHAPTER II. (<i>Black Fish</i>).&mdash;I give the popular\\r\\n      fishermen&rsquo;s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.\\r\\n      Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and\\r\\n      suggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called, because\\r\\n      blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the Hyena\\r\\n      Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the\\r\\n      circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he\\r\\n      carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale\\r\\n      averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost\\r\\n      all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in\\r\\n      swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more\\r\\n      profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena\\r\\n      whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment&mdash;as\\r\\n      some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by\\r\\n      themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax. Though their\\r\\n      blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you upwards of\\r\\n      thirty gallons of oil.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>), CHAPTER III. (<i>Narwhale</i>), that is, <i>Nostril whale</i>.&mdash;Another\\r\\n      instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from his peculiar\\r\\n      horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The creature is some\\r\\n      sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five feet, though some\\r\\n      exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly speaking, this horn\\r\\n      is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little\\r\\n      depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found on the sinister side,\\r\\n      which has an ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the\\r\\n      aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What precise purpose this ivory horn\\r\\n      or lance answers, it would be hard to say. It does not seem to be used\\r\\n      like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors tell\\r\\n      me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of\\r\\n      the sea for food. Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer; for\\r\\n      the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it\\r\\n      sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks through. But you\\r\\n      cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct. My own opinion is,\\r\\n      that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale&mdash;however\\r\\n      that may be&mdash;it would certainly be very convenient to him for a\\r\\n      folder in reading pamphlets. The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked\\r\\n      whale, the Horned whale, and the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious\\r\\n      example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated\\r\\n      nature. From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same\\r\\n      sea-unicorn&rsquo;s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote\\r\\n      against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices. It\\r\\n      was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same way\\r\\n      that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.\\r\\n      Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. Black\\r\\n      Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage,\\r\\n      when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window\\r\\n      of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; &ldquo;when Sir\\r\\n      Martin returned from that voyage,&rdquo; saith Black Letter, &ldquo;on bended knees he\\r\\n      presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale, which\\r\\n      for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor.&rdquo; An Irish author\\r\\n      avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did likewise present to\\r\\n      her highness another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn\\r\\n      nature.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a\\r\\n      milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black. His\\r\\n      oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it, and he is\\r\\n      seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>), CHAPTER IV. (<i>Killer</i>).&mdash;Of this whale little is\\r\\n      precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed\\r\\n      naturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say that\\r\\n      he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage&mdash;a sort of\\r\\n      Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and\\r\\n      hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death. The\\r\\n      Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has. Exception\\r\\n      might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the ground of its\\r\\n      indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on sea; Bonapartes and\\r\\n      Sharks included.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>), CHAPTER V. (<i>Thrasher</i>).&mdash;This gentleman is famous\\r\\n      for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He mounts\\r\\n      the Folio whale&rsquo;s back, and as he swims, he works his passage by flogging\\r\\n      him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process.\\r\\n      Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both are outlaws,\\r\\n      even in the lawless seas.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n       Thus ends BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>), and begins BOOK III. (<i>Duodecimo</i>).\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      DUODECIMOES.&mdash;These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza\\r\\n      Porpoise. II. The Algerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may\\r\\n      possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five\\r\\n      feet should be marshalled among WHALES&mdash;a word, which, in the popular\\r\\n      sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set down\\r\\n      above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my definition\\r\\n      of what a whale is&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> a spouting fish, with a horizontal tail.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      BOOK III. (<i>Duodecimo</i>), CHAPTER 1. (<i>Huzza Porpoise</i>).&mdash;This is the\\r\\n      common porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own\\r\\n      bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something\\r\\n      must be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always swims\\r\\n      in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to\\r\\n      heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their appearance is generally\\r\\n      hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of fine spirits, they invariably\\r\\n      come from the breezy billows to windward. They are the lads that always\\r\\n      live before the wind. They are accounted a lucky omen. If you yourself can\\r\\n      withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then heaven help\\r\\n      ye; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza\\r\\n      Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and\\r\\n      delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in\\r\\n      request among jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones.\\r\\n      Porpoise meat is good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you\\r\\n      that a porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very\\r\\n      readily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him; and\\r\\n      you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      BOOK III. (<i>Duodecimo</i>), CHAPTER II. (<i>Algerine Porpoise</i>).&mdash;A pirate.\\r\\n      Very savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat\\r\\n      larger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make. Provoke\\r\\n      him, and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many times, but\\r\\n      never yet saw him captured.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      BOOK III. (<i>Duodecimo</i>), CHAPTER III. (<i>Mealy-mouthed Porpoise</i>).&mdash;The\\r\\n      largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it is\\r\\n      known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been designated, is\\r\\n      that of the fishers&mdash;Right-Whale Porpoise, from the circumstance that\\r\\n      he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In shape, he differs in\\r\\n      some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly\\r\\n      girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and gentleman-like figure. He has no\\r\\n      fins on his back (most other porpoises have), he has a lovely tail, and\\r\\n      sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all.\\r\\n      Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a\\r\\n      boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship&rsquo;s hull, called the &ldquo;bright\\r\\n      waist,&rdquo; that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate\\r\\n      colours, black above and white below. The white comprises part of his\\r\\n      head, and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just\\r\\n      escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag. A most mean and mealy\\r\\n      aspect! His oil is much like that of the common porpoise.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n     * * * * * *\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the\\r\\n      Porpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the Leviathans\\r\\n      of note. But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive, half-fabulous\\r\\n      whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by reputation, but not\\r\\n      personally. I shall enumerate them by their fore-castle appellations; for\\r\\n      possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators, who may\\r\\n      complete what I have here but begun. If any of the following whales, shall\\r\\n      hereafter be caught and marked, then he can readily be incorporated into\\r\\n      this System, according to his Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:&mdash;The\\r\\n      Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape\\r\\n      Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered\\r\\n      Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue\\r\\n      Whale; etc. From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there\\r\\n      might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner\\r\\n      of uncouth names. But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly\\r\\n      help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying\\r\\n      nothing.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be here,\\r\\n      and at once, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I have kept my\\r\\n      word. But I now leave my cetological System standing thus unfinished, even\\r\\n      as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the crane still standing\\r\\n      upon the top of the uncompleted tower. For small erections may be finished\\r\\n      by their first architects; grand ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone\\r\\n      to posterity. God keep me from ever completing anything. This whole book\\r\\n      is but a draught&mdash;nay, but the draught of a draught.

The Specksnyder.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place as\\r\\n      any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising from\\r\\n      the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown of\\r\\n      course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The large importance attached to the harpooneer&rsquo;s vocation is evinced by\\r\\n      the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries and more\\r\\n      ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now\\r\\n      called the captain, but was divided between him and an officer called the\\r\\n      Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time\\r\\n      made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In those days, the captain&rsquo;s\\r\\n      authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the\\r\\n      vessel; while over the whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the\\r\\n      Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme. In the British Greenland\\r\\n      Fishery, under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch\\r\\n      official is still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged. At\\r\\n      present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of\\r\\n      the captain&rsquo;s more inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good\\r\\n      conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely\\r\\n      depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important\\r\\n      officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a\\r\\n      whaling ground) the command of the ship&rsquo;s deck is also his; therefore the\\r\\n      grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live\\r\\n      apart from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as\\r\\n      their professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded\\r\\n      as their social equal.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is this&mdash;the\\r\\n      first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and merchantmen\\r\\n      alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and so, too, in\\r\\n      most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part\\r\\n      of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in the captain&rsquo;s cabin,\\r\\n      and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest of\\r\\n      all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and the\\r\\n      community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high or\\r\\n      low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their common\\r\\n      luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and hard work;\\r\\n      though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous\\r\\n      discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind how much like an\\r\\n      old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some primitive instances,\\r\\n      live together; for all that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the\\r\\n      quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away.\\r\\n      Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper\\r\\n      parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any\\r\\n      military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore\\r\\n      the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given\\r\\n      to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage he ever\\r\\n      exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he required no man\\r\\n      to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck; and\\r\\n      though there were times when, owing to peculiar circumstances connected\\r\\n      with events hereafter to be detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms,\\r\\n      whether of condescension or <i>in terrorem</i>, or otherwise; yet even Captain\\r\\n      Ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the\\r\\n      sea.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those\\r\\n      forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally\\r\\n      making use of them for other and more private ends than they were\\r\\n      legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of his brain,\\r\\n      which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested; through those\\r\\n      forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible\\r\\n      dictatorship. For be a man&rsquo;s intellectual superiority what it will, it can\\r\\n      never assume the practical, available supremacy over other men, without\\r\\n      the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in\\r\\n      themselves, more or less paltry and base. This it is, that for ever keeps\\r\\n      God&rsquo;s true princes of the Empire from the world&rsquo;s hustings; and leaves the\\r\\n      highest honors that this air can give, to those men who become famous\\r\\n      more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of\\r\\n      the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over the dead\\r\\n      level of the mass. Such large virtue lurks in these small things when\\r\\n      extreme political superstitions invest them, that in some royal instances\\r\\n      even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency. But when, as in the\\r\\n      case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire\\r\\n      encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before\\r\\n      the tremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would\\r\\n      depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing, ever\\r\\n      forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one now\\r\\n      alluded to.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness\\r\\n      and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings, I must\\r\\n      not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old whale-hunter like him;\\r\\n      and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied\\r\\n      me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked at\\r\\n      from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied\\r\\n      air!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0034\" id=\"link2HCH0034\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread\\r\\n      face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord and master; who,\\r\\n      sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking an observation of\\r\\n      the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth,\\r\\n      medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part\\r\\n      of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the tidings, you would\\r\\n      think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But presently, catching\\r\\n      hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the deck, and in an even,\\r\\n      unexhilarated voice, saying, &ldquo;Dinner, Mr. Starbuck,&rdquo; disappears into the\\r\\n      cabin.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      When the last echo of his sultan&rsquo;s step has died away, and Starbuck, the\\r\\n      first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then Starbuck\\r\\n      rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after a\\r\\n      grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness,\\r\\n      &ldquo;Dinner, Mr. Stubb,&rdquo; and descends the scuttle. The second Emir lounges\\r\\n      about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the main brace, to see\\r\\n      whether it will be all right with that important rope, he likewise takes\\r\\n      up the old burden, and with a rapid &ldquo;Dinner, Mr. Flask,&rdquo; follows after his\\r\\n      predecessors.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,\\r\\n      seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all sorts\\r\\n      of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his shoes, he\\r\\n      strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the\\r\\n      Grand Turk&rsquo;s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching his cap up\\r\\n      into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so far at least as\\r\\n      he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other processions, by\\r\\n      bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into the cabin doorway\\r\\n      below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and, then, independent,\\r\\n      hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab&rsquo;s presence, in the character of\\r\\n      Abjectus, or the Slave.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense\\r\\n      artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck some\\r\\n      officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and defyingly\\r\\n      enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those very officers\\r\\n      the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander&rsquo;s\\r\\n      cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say deprecatory and\\r\\n      humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the table; this is\\r\\n      marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this difference? A problem?\\r\\n      Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of Babylon; and to have been\\r\\n      Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously, therein certainly must have\\r\\n      been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he who in the rightly regal and\\r\\n      intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner-table of invited\\r\\n      guests, that man&rsquo;s unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence\\r\\n      for the time; that man&rsquo;s royalty of state transcends Belshazzar&rsquo;s, for\\r\\n      Belshazzar was not the greatest. Who has but once dined his friends, has\\r\\n      tasted what it is to be CÃ¦sar. It is a witchery of social czarship which\\r\\n      there is no withstanding. Now, if to this consideration you superadd the\\r\\n      official supremacy of a ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive\\r\\n      the cause of that peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion on\\r\\n      the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still deferential\\r\\n      cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be served. They were\\r\\n      as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab, there seemed not to lurk\\r\\n      the smallest social arrogance. With one mind, their intent eyes all\\r\\n      fastened upon the old man&rsquo;s knife, as he carved the chief dish before him.\\r\\n      I do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment\\r\\n      with the slightest observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the\\r\\n      weather. No! And when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the\\r\\n      slice of beef was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck&rsquo;s plate towards\\r\\n      him, the mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it\\r\\n      tenderly; and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the\\r\\n      plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without\\r\\n      circumspection. For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the\\r\\n      German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these\\r\\n      cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at\\r\\n      table old Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a\\r\\n      relief it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the\\r\\n      hold below. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy\\r\\n      of this weary family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his\\r\\n      would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help\\r\\n      himself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first\\r\\n      degree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would\\r\\n      he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world; nevertheless,\\r\\n      strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped himself, the\\r\\n      chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it. Least of all, did Flask\\r\\n      presume to help himself to butter. Whether he thought the owners of the\\r\\n      ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear, sunny\\r\\n      complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such\\r\\n      marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for him,\\r\\n      a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask is\\r\\n      the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask&rsquo;s dinner was badly jammed in\\r\\n      point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him; and yet they\\r\\n      also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb even, who is but\\r\\n      a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small appetite, and soon\\r\\n      shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask must bestir himself,\\r\\n      he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy\\r\\n      usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck. Therefore it was that Flask\\r\\n      once admitted in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of\\r\\n      an officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be\\r\\n      otherwise than hungry, more or less. For what he ate did not so much\\r\\n      relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him. Peace and satisfaction,\\r\\n      thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach. I am an officer;\\r\\n      but, how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned beef in the\\r\\n      forecastle, as I used to when I was before the mast. There&rsquo;s the fruits of\\r\\n      promotion now; there&rsquo;s the vanity of glory: there&rsquo;s the insanity of life!\\r\\n      Besides, if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge\\r\\n      against Flask in Flask&rsquo;s official capacity, all that sailor had to do, in\\r\\n      order to obtain ample vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a\\r\\n      peep at Flask through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered\\r\\n      before awful Ahab.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in\\r\\n      the Pequod&rsquo;s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted order\\r\\n      to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was restored to\\r\\n      some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the three harpooneers\\r\\n      were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary legatees. They made a\\r\\n      sort of temporary servants&rsquo; hall of the high and mighty cabin.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless\\r\\n      invisible domineerings of the captain&rsquo;s table, was the entire care-free\\r\\n      license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows\\r\\n      the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the\\r\\n      sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed their food\\r\\n      with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined like lords;\\r\\n      they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices.\\r\\n      Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the\\r\\n      vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain\\r\\n      to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the\\r\\n      solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a\\r\\n      nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of\\r\\n      accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise. And once\\r\\n      Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy&rsquo;s memory by\\r\\n      snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden\\r\\n      trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the circle\\r\\n      preliminary to scalping him. He was naturally a very nervous, shuddering\\r\\n      sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt\\r\\n      baker and a hospital nurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the\\r\\n      black terrific Ahab, and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these\\r\\n      three savages, Dough-Boy&rsquo;s whole life was one continual lip-quiver.\\r\\n      Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they\\r\\n      demanded, he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry\\r\\n      adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door,\\r\\n      till all was over.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing his\\r\\n      filed teeth to the Indian&rsquo;s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on the\\r\\n      floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low\\r\\n      carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin\\r\\n      framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship.\\r\\n      But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious, not to say\\r\\n      dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small\\r\\n      mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad,\\r\\n      baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed\\r\\n      strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through his\\r\\n      dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by beef or\\r\\n      by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a mortal,\\r\\n      barbaric smack of the lip in eating&mdash;an ugly sound enough&mdash;so\\r\\n      much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any\\r\\n      marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear\\r\\n      Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be\\r\\n      picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging\\r\\n      round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor did the\\r\\n      whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their lances\\r\\n      and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they would\\r\\n      ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not at all\\r\\n      tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his\\r\\n      Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some\\r\\n      murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the white\\r\\n      waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on his arm,\\r\\n      but a buckler. In good time, though, to his great delight, the three\\r\\n      salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous, fable-mongering\\r\\n      ears, all their martial bones jingling in them at every step, like Moorish\\r\\n      scimetars in scabbards.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived\\r\\n      there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were\\r\\n      scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,\\r\\n      when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale\\r\\n      captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights the\\r\\n      ship&rsquo;s cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that\\r\\n      anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth, the\\r\\n      mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to have\\r\\n      lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it was\\r\\n      something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for a moment,\\r\\n      only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing, residing in the\\r\\n      open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin was no\\r\\n      companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally included\\r\\n      in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He lived in the\\r\\n      world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri. And as\\r\\n      when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying\\r\\n      himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking his\\r\\n      own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab&rsquo;s soul, shut up in\\r\\n      the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0035\" id=\"link2HCH0035\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 35. The Mast-Head.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the\\r\\n      other seamen my first mast-head came round.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously\\r\\n      with the vessel&rsquo;s leaving her port; even though she may have fifteen\\r\\n      thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground.\\r\\n      And if, after a three, four, or five years&rsquo; voyage she is drawing nigh\\r\\n      home with anything empty in her&mdash;say, an empty vial even&mdash;then,\\r\\n      her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her skysail-poles\\r\\n      sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether relinquish the\\r\\n      hope of capturing one whale more.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very\\r\\n      ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here. I take\\r\\n      it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old Egyptians;\\r\\n      because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them. For though their\\r\\n      progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by their tower, have\\r\\n      intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet\\r\\n      (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may\\r\\n      be said to have gone by the board, in the dread gale of God&rsquo;s wrath;\\r\\n      therefore, we cannot give these Babel builders priority over the\\r\\n      Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is\\r\\n      an assertion based upon the general belief among archÃ¦ologists, that the\\r\\n      first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory singularly\\r\\n      supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four sides of those\\r\\n      edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those\\r\\n      old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new\\r\\n      stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a\\r\\n      whale just bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian\\r\\n      hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and\\r\\n      spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his\\r\\n      food from the ground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance\\r\\n      of a dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his\\r\\n      place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing\\r\\n      everything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern\\r\\n      standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and\\r\\n      bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still\\r\\n      entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any\\r\\n      strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of\\r\\n      Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the\\r\\n      air; careless, now, who rules the decks below; whether Louis Philippe,\\r\\n      Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high aloft\\r\\n      on his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules&rsquo; pillars,\\r\\n      his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals\\r\\n      will go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his\\r\\n      mast-head in Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London\\r\\n      smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is\\r\\n      smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor\\r\\n      Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to\\r\\n      befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;\\r\\n      however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the thick\\r\\n      haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head standers\\r\\n      of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not so, is\\r\\n      plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole historian of\\r\\n      Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us, that in the early\\r\\n      times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit\\r\\n      of the game, the people of that island erected lofty spars along the\\r\\n      sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats,\\r\\n      something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few years ago this same\\r\\n      plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying\\r\\n      the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach. But this\\r\\n      custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head,\\r\\n      that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads are kept manned from\\r\\n      sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the\\r\\n      helm), and relieving each other every two hours. In the serene weather of\\r\\n      the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy\\r\\n      meditative man it is delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the\\r\\n      silent decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic\\r\\n      stilts, while beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the\\r\\n      hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of\\r\\n      the famous Colossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite\\r\\n      series of the sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship\\r\\n      indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you\\r\\n      into languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime\\r\\n      uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras\\r\\n      with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary\\r\\n      excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities;\\r\\n      fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have\\r\\n      for dinner&mdash;for all your meals for three years and more are snugly\\r\\n      stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years&rsquo; voyage,\\r\\n      as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast-head\\r\\n      would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be deplored that\\r\\n      the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term\\r\\n      of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching\\r\\n      to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of\\r\\n      feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a\\r\\n      pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small and snug contrivances in\\r\\n      which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your most usual point of perch\\r\\n      is the head of the t&rsquo; gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin parallel\\r\\n      sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t&rsquo; gallant cross-trees.\\r\\n      Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about as cosy as he\\r\\n      would standing on a bull&rsquo;s horns. To be sure, in cold weather you may\\r\\n      carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a watch-coat; but\\r\\n      properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more of a house than the\\r\\n      unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and\\r\\n      cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out of it, without running\\r\\n      great risk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps\\r\\n      in winter); so a watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere\\r\\n      envelope, or additional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest\\r\\n      of drawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of\\r\\n      your watch-coat.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a\\r\\n      southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or\\r\\n      pulpits, called <i>crow&rsquo;s-nests</i>, in which the look-outs of a Greenland whaler\\r\\n      are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In the\\r\\n      fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled &ldquo;A Voyage among the\\r\\n      Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the\\r\\n      re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;&rdquo; in this\\r\\n      admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a\\r\\n      charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented\\r\\n      <i>crow&rsquo;s-nest</i> of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet&rsquo;s good\\r\\n      craft. He called it the <i>Sleet&rsquo;s crow&rsquo;s-nest</i>, in honor of himself; he\\r\\n      being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous\\r\\n      false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our own\\r\\n      names (we fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so likewise\\r\\n      should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget. In\\r\\n      shape, the Sleet&rsquo;s crow&rsquo;s-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe;\\r\\n      it is open above, however, where it is furnished with a movable\\r\\n      side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale. Being fixed\\r\\n      on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch\\r\\n      in the bottom. On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship, is a\\r\\n      comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and\\r\\n      coats. In front is a leather rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet,\\r\\n      pipe, telescope, and other nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in\\r\\n      person stood his mast-head in this crow&rsquo;s-nest of his, he tells us that he\\r\\n      always had a rifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a\\r\\n      powder flask and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales,\\r\\n      or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot\\r\\n      successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the\\r\\n      water, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it was\\r\\n      plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the\\r\\n      little detailed conveniences of his crow&rsquo;s-nest; but though he so enlarges\\r\\n      upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account\\r\\n      of his experiments in this crow&rsquo;s-nest, with a small compass he kept there\\r\\n      for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called\\r\\n      the &ldquo;local attraction&rdquo; of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the\\r\\n      horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship&rsquo;s planks, and in the Glacier&rsquo;s\\r\\n      case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among\\r\\n      her crew; I say, that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific\\r\\n      here, yet, for all his learned &ldquo;binnacle deviations,&rdquo; &ldquo;azimuth compass\\r\\n      observations,&rdquo; and &ldquo;approximate errors,&rdquo; he knows very well, Captain\\r\\n      Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic\\r\\n      meditations, as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well\\r\\n      replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his\\r\\n      crow&rsquo;s nest, within easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I\\r\\n      greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain;\\r\\n      yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that\\r\\n      case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have\\r\\n      been, while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the\\r\\n      mathematics aloft there in that bird&rsquo;s nest within three or four perches\\r\\n      of the pole.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain\\r\\n      Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is greatly\\r\\n      counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive\\r\\n      seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used to lounge up\\r\\n      the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a chat with\\r\\n      Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there; then ascending\\r\\n      a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the top-sail yard, take\\r\\n      a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so at last mount to my\\r\\n      ultimate destination.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept but\\r\\n      sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how could I&mdash;being\\r\\n      left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering altitude&mdash;how\\r\\n      could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale-ships&rsquo;\\r\\n      standing orders, &ldquo;Keep your weather eye open, and sing out every time.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of\\r\\n      Nantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with\\r\\n      lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who\\r\\n      offers to ship with the PhÃ¦don instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware of\\r\\n      such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before they can be killed;\\r\\n      and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes round the\\r\\n      world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. Nor are these\\r\\n      monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery furnishes an\\r\\n      asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded young men,\\r\\n      disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking sentiment in tar\\r\\n      and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the\\r\\n      mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship, and in moody phrase\\r\\n      ejaculates:&mdash;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n<pre xml:space=\"preserve\">\\r\\n      &ldquo;Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!\\r\\n      Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.&rdquo;\\r\\n</pre>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young\\r\\n      philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient\\r\\n      &ldquo;interest&rdquo; in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to\\r\\n      all honorable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would rather\\r\\n      not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those young Platonists\\r\\n      have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they are short-sighted; what\\r\\n      use, then, to strain the visual nerve? They have left their opera-glasses\\r\\n      at home.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Why, thou monkey,&rdquo; said a harpooneer to one of these lads, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been\\r\\n      cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale yet.\\r\\n      Whales are scarce as hen&rsquo;s teeth whenever thou art up here.&rdquo; Perhaps they\\r\\n      were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon;\\r\\n      but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of vacant, unconscious\\r\\n      reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with\\r\\n      thoughts, that at last he loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at\\r\\n      his feet for the visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul,\\r\\n      pervading mankind and nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding,\\r\\n      beautiful thing that eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of\\r\\n      some undiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those elusive\\r\\n      thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it. In\\r\\n      this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came; becomes\\r\\n      diffused through time and space; like Cranmer&rsquo;s sprinkled Pantheistic\\r\\n      ashes, forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a\\r\\n      gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from the\\r\\n      inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on ye, move\\r\\n      your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your identity comes\\r\\n      back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And perhaps, at\\r\\n      mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled shriek you drop\\r\\n      through that transparent air into the summer sea, no more to rise for\\r\\n      ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0036\" id=\"link2HCH0036\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 36. The Quarter-Deck.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      (<i>Enter Ahab: Then, all.</i>)\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning\\r\\n      shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the cabin-gangway\\r\\n      to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that hour, as country\\r\\n      gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in the garden.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old\\r\\n      rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over\\r\\n      dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did\\r\\n      you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also, you\\r\\n      would see still stranger foot-prints&mdash;the foot-prints of his one\\r\\n      unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his\\r\\n      nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his thought\\r\\n      was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the main-mast\\r\\n      and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought turn in him as\\r\\n      he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely possessing him,\\r\\n      indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye mark him, Flask?&rdquo; whispered Stubb; &ldquo;the chick that&rsquo;s in him pecks\\r\\n      the shell. &rsquo;Twill soon be out.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The hours wore on;&mdash;Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing\\r\\n      the deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks,\\r\\n      and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and with one hand\\r\\n      grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on\\r\\n      ship-board except in some extraordinary case.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Send everybody aft,&rdquo; repeated Ahab. &ldquo;Mast-heads, there! come down!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      When the entire ship&rsquo;s company were assembled, and with curious and not\\r\\n      wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike the\\r\\n      weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly glancing\\r\\n      over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew, started from\\r\\n      his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy\\r\\n      turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to\\r\\n      pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men; till Stubb\\r\\n      cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have summoned them there for\\r\\n      the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat. But this did not last long.\\r\\n      Vehemently pausing, he cried:&mdash;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Sing out for him!&rdquo; was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed\\r\\n      voices.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the\\r\\n      hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically\\r\\n      thrown them.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And what do ye next, men?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Lower away, and after him!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And what tune is it ye pull to, men?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;A dead whale or a stove boat!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the\\r\\n      countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to\\r\\n      gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they\\r\\n      themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his\\r\\n      pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly, almost\\r\\n      convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:&mdash;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white\\r\\n      whale. Look ye! d&rsquo;ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?&rdquo;&mdash;holding up a\\r\\n      broad bright coin to the sun&mdash;&ldquo;it is a sixteen dollar piece, men.\\r\\n      D&rsquo;ye see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was slowly\\r\\n      rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if to heighten\\r\\n      its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to\\r\\n      himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it\\r\\n      seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast\\r\\n      with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the other,\\r\\n      and with a high raised voice exclaiming: &ldquo;Whosoever of ye raises me a\\r\\n      white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw; whosoever of ye\\r\\n      raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes punctured in his\\r\\n      starboard fluke&mdash;look ye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white\\r\\n      whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Huzza! huzza!&rdquo; cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed\\r\\n      the act of nailing the gold to the mast.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a white whale, I say,&rdquo; resumed Ahab, as he threw down the topmaul:\\r\\n      &ldquo;a white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white water;\\r\\n      if ye see but a bubble, sing out.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even more\\r\\n      intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of the\\r\\n      wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately\\r\\n      touched by some specific recollection.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Captain Ahab,&rdquo; said Tashtego, &ldquo;that white whale must be the same that\\r\\n      some call Moby Dick.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Moby Dick?&rdquo; shouted Ahab. &ldquo;Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?&rdquo; said the\\r\\n      Gay-Header deliberately.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And has he a curious spout, too,&rdquo; said Daggoo, &ldquo;very bushy, even for a\\r\\n      parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And he have one, two, three&mdash;oh! good many iron in him hide, too,\\r\\n      Captain,&rdquo; cried Queequeg disjointedly, &ldquo;all twiske-tee be-twisk, like him&mdash;him&mdash;&rdquo;\\r\\n       faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and round as though\\r\\n      uncorking a bottle&mdash;&ldquo;like him&mdash;him&mdash;&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Corkscrew!&rdquo; cried Ahab, &ldquo;aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted and\\r\\n      wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole shock\\r\\n      of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual\\r\\n      sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a split jib in a\\r\\n      squall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have seen&mdash;Moby\\r\\n      Dick&mdash;Moby Dick!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Captain Ahab,&rdquo; said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far\\r\\n      been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed\\r\\n      struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. &ldquo;Captain\\r\\n      Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick&mdash;but it was not Moby Dick that took\\r\\n      off thy leg?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Who told thee that?&rdquo; cried Ahab; then pausing, &ldquo;Aye, Starbuck; aye, my\\r\\n      hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that\\r\\n      brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,&rdquo; he shouted with a\\r\\n      terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose; &ldquo;Aye,\\r\\n      aye! it was that accursed white whale that razed me; made a poor pegging\\r\\n      lubber of me for ever and a day!&rdquo; Then tossing both arms, with measureless\\r\\n      imprecations he shouted out: &ldquo;Aye, aye! and I&rsquo;ll chase him round Good\\r\\n      Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round\\r\\n      perdition&rsquo;s flames before I give him up. And this is what ye have shipped\\r\\n      for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all\\r\\n      sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out. What say ye,\\r\\n      men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do look brave.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, aye!&rdquo; shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the\\r\\n      excited old man: &ldquo;A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for Moby\\r\\n      Dick!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;God bless ye,&rdquo; he seemed to half sob and half shout. &ldquo;God bless ye, men.\\r\\n      Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what&rsquo;s this long face\\r\\n      about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not game for\\r\\n      Moby Dick?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain\\r\\n      Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I came\\r\\n      here to hunt whales, not my commander&rsquo;s vengeance. How many barrels will\\r\\n      thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab? it will\\r\\n      not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a\\r\\n      little lower layer. If money&rsquo;s to be the measurer, man, and the\\r\\n      accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by\\r\\n      girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then, let\\r\\n      me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium <i>here!</i>&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He smites his chest,&rdquo; whispered Stubb, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that for? methinks it\\r\\n      rings most vast, but hollow.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Vengeance on a dumb brute!&rdquo; cried Starbuck, &ldquo;that simply smote thee from\\r\\n      blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing, Captain Ahab,\\r\\n      seems blasphemous.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Hark ye yet again&mdash;the little lower layer. All visible objects, man,\\r\\n      are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event&mdash;in the living act,\\r\\n      the undoubted deed&mdash;there, some unknown but still reasoning thing\\r\\n      puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask.\\r\\n      If man will strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach\\r\\n      outside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is\\r\\n      that wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there&rsquo;s naught beyond. But\\r\\n      &rsquo;tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength,\\r\\n      with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is chiefly\\r\\n      what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale\\r\\n      principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of blasphemy,\\r\\n      man; I&rsquo;d strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the sun do that, then\\r\\n      could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein,\\r\\n      jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my master, man, is even\\r\\n      that fair play. Who&rsquo;s over me? Truth hath no confines. Take off thine eye!\\r\\n      more intolerable than fiends&rsquo; glarings is a doltish stare! So, so; thou\\r\\n      reddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow. But look ye,\\r\\n      Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing unsays itself. There are men\\r\\n      from whom warm words are small indignity. I meant not to incense thee. Let\\r\\n      it go. Look! see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn&mdash;living,\\r\\n      breathing pictures painted by the sun. The Pagan leopards&mdash;the\\r\\n      unrecking and unworshipping things, that live; and seek, and give no\\r\\n      reasons for the torrid life they feel! The crew, man, the crew! Are they\\r\\n      not one and all with Ahab, in this matter of the whale? See Stubb! he\\r\\n      laughs! See yonder Chilian! he snorts to think of it. Stand up amid the\\r\\n      general hurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it?\\r\\n      Reckon it. &rsquo;Tis but to help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck.\\r\\n      What is it more? From this one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all\\r\\n      Nantucket, surely he will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has\\r\\n      clutched a whetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow\\r\\n      lifts thee! Speak, but speak!&mdash;Aye, aye! thy silence, then, <i>that</i>\\r\\n      voices thee. (<i>Aside</i>) Something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has\\r\\n      inhaled it in his lungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now,\\r\\n      without rebellion.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;God keep me!&mdash;keep us all!&rdquo; murmured Starbuck, lowly.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab did\\r\\n      not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the hold;\\r\\n      nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor yet the\\r\\n      hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment their hearts\\r\\n      sank in. For again Starbuck&rsquo;s downcast eyes lighted up with the\\r\\n      stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the winds blew on;\\r\\n      the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as before. Ah, ye\\r\\n      admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come? But rather are ye\\r\\n      predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so much predictions from\\r\\n      without, as verifications of the foregoing things within. For with little\\r\\n      external to constrain us, the innermost necessities in our being, these\\r\\n      still drive us on.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The measure! the measure!&rdquo; cried Ahab.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he ordered\\r\\n      them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him near the\\r\\n      capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three mates stood\\r\\n      at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship&rsquo;s company formed a\\r\\n      circle round the group; he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every\\r\\n      man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his, as the bloodshot eyes of the\\r\\n      prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader, ere he rushes on at their\\r\\n      head in the trail of the bison; but, alas! only to fall into the hidden\\r\\n      snare of the Indian.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Drink and pass!&rdquo; he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the\\r\\n      nearest seaman. &ldquo;The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short\\r\\n      draughts&mdash;long swallows, men; &rsquo;tis hot as Satan&rsquo;s hoof. So, so; it\\r\\n      goes round excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the\\r\\n      serpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it went, this\\r\\n      way it comes. Hand it me&mdash;here&rsquo;s a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so\\r\\n      brimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this capstan; and ye\\r\\n      mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there with\\r\\n      your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some sort\\r\\n      revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. O men, you will\\r\\n      yet see that&mdash;Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner. Hand\\r\\n      it me. Why, now, this pewter had run brimming again, wer&rsquo;t not thou St.\\r\\n      Vitus&rsquo; imp&mdash;away, thou ague!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Advance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me. Well done! Let me\\r\\n      touch the axis.&rdquo; So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three level,\\r\\n      radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing, suddenly and\\r\\n      nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from Starbuck to\\r\\n      Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some nameless,\\r\\n      interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery\\r\\n      emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own magnetic life. The\\r\\n      three mates quailed before his strong, sustained, and mystic aspect. Stubb\\r\\n      and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest eye of Starbuck fell\\r\\n      downright.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;In vain!&rdquo; cried Ahab; &ldquo;but, maybe, &rsquo;tis well. For did ye three but once\\r\\n      take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, <i>that</i> had perhaps\\r\\n      expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped ye dead.\\r\\n      Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do appoint ye\\r\\n      three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there&mdash;yon three most\\r\\n      honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain the\\r\\n      task? What, when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars, using his\\r\\n      tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals! your own condescension, <i>that</i> shall\\r\\n      bend ye to it. I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your seizings and draw\\r\\n      the poles, ye harpooneers!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the\\r\\n      detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs\\r\\n      up, before him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over! know ye not\\r\\n      the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-bearers, advance.\\r\\n      The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!&rdquo; Forthwith, slowly going\\r\\n      from one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the\\r\\n      fiery waters from the pewter.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow\\r\\n      them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha!\\r\\n      Starbuck! but the deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon\\r\\n      it. Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man the deathful\\r\\n      whaleboat&rsquo;s bow&mdash;Death to Moby Dick! God hunt us all, if we do not\\r\\n      hunt Moby Dick to his death!&rdquo; The long, barbed steel goblets were lifted;\\r\\n      and to cries and maledictions against the white whale, the spirits were\\r\\n      simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss. Starbuck paled, and turned, and\\r\\n      shivered. Once more, and finally, the replenished pewter went the rounds\\r\\n      among the frantic crew; when, waving his free hand to them, they all\\r\\n      dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0037\" id=\"link2HCH0037\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 37.

The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them; but\\r\\n      first I pass.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Yonder, by ever-brimming goblet&rsquo;s rim, the warm waves blush like wine. The\\r\\n      gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sun&mdash;slow dived from noon&mdash;goes\\r\\n      down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then, the\\r\\n      crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet is it bright\\r\\n      with many a gem; I the wearer, see not its far flashings; but darkly feel\\r\\n      that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. &rsquo;Tis iron&mdash;that I know&mdash;not\\r\\n      gold. &rsquo;Tis split, too&mdash;that I feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my\\r\\n      brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; the\\r\\n      sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Dry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred me,\\r\\n      so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not me; all\\r\\n      loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne&rsquo;er enjoy. Gifted with the high\\r\\n      perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most\\r\\n      malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good night&mdash;good night!\\r\\n      (<i>waving his hand, he moves from the window</i>.)\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &rsquo;Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at the least;\\r\\n      but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they\\r\\n      revolve. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all stand\\r\\n      before me; and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the match\\r\\n      itself must needs be wasting! What I&rsquo;ve dared, I&rsquo;ve willed; and what I&rsquo;ve\\r\\n      willed, I&rsquo;ll do! They think me mad&mdash;Starbuck does; but I&rsquo;m demoniac,\\r\\n      I am madness maddened!

But not all of them knew of his existence; only a\\r\\n      few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen him; while the number who\\r\\n      as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him, was small indeed.\\r\\n      For, owing to the large number of whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they\\r\\n      were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference, many of them\\r\\n      adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom\\r\\n      or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a\\r\\n      single news-telling sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each\\r\\n      separate voyage; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home; all\\r\\n      these, with other circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the\\r\\n      spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special\\r\\n      individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted,\\r\\n      that several vessels reported to have encountered, at such or such a time,\\r\\n      or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and\\r\\n      malignity, which whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had\\r\\n      completely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption, I\\r\\n      say, that the whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick.\\r\\n      Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not\\r\\n      unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster\\r\\n      attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave\\r\\n      battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were\\r\\n      content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to the\\r\\n      perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the individual cause.\\r\\n      In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale\\r\\n      had hitherto been popularly regarded.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance\\r\\n      caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of\\r\\n      them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other\\r\\n      whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue in these\\r\\n      assaults&mdash;not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken limbs,\\r\\n      or devouring amputations&mdash;but fatal to the last degree of fatality;\\r\\n      those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and piling their\\r\\n      terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude\\r\\n      of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually\\r\\n      come.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more\\r\\n      horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do\\r\\n      fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising\\r\\n      terrible events,&mdash;as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but,\\r\\n      in maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors\\r\\n      abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to. And\\r\\n      as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery\\r\\n      surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and\\r\\n      fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only\\r\\n      are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness\\r\\n      hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they are by all odds the\\r\\n      most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly\\r\\n      astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its greatest\\r\\n      marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such remotest\\r\\n      waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a thousand\\r\\n      shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught\\r\\n      hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes,\\r\\n      pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by\\r\\n      influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty\\r\\n      birth.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the\\r\\n      widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the\\r\\n      end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and\\r\\n      half-formed fÅ\\x93tal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which eventually\\r\\n      invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly\\r\\n      appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike, that\\r\\n      few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White Whale, few of\\r\\n      those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.\\r\\n      Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale,\\r\\n      as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan, died\\r\\n      out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are those this day among\\r\\n      them, who, though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to\\r\\n      the Greenland or Right whale, would perhaps&mdash;either from professional\\r\\n      inexperience, or incompetency, or timidity, decline a contest with the\\r\\n      Sperm Whale; at any rate, there are plenty of whalemen, especially among\\r\\n      those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag, who have never\\r\\n      hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the\\r\\n      leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the\\r\\n      North; seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish\\r\\n      fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern whaling.\\r\\n      Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere\\r\\n      more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows which stem him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary\\r\\n      times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book naturalists&mdash;Olassen\\r\\n      and Povelson&mdash;declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a\\r\\n      consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be so\\r\\n      incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood. Nor\\r\\n      even down to so late a time as Cuvier&rsquo;s, were these or almost similar\\r\\n      impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron himself affirms\\r\\n      that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks included) are &ldquo;struck\\r\\n      with the most lively terrors,&rdquo; and &ldquo;often in the precipitancy of their\\r\\n      flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause\\r\\n      instantaneous death.&rdquo; And however the general experiences in the fishery\\r\\n      may amend such reports as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to\\r\\n      the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in\\r\\n      some vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of\\r\\n      the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days of the\\r\\n      Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised\\r\\n      Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare;\\r\\n      such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully\\r\\n      pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the Sperm\\r\\n      Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be inevitably to\\r\\n      be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are some remarkable\\r\\n      documents that may be consulted.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things were\\r\\n      ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who, chancing\\r\\n      only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the specific details of\\r\\n      any certain calamity, and without superstitious accompaniments, were\\r\\n      sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked\\r\\n      with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was the\\r\\n      unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had actually been\\r\\n      encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether\\r\\n      without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as the secrets\\r\\n      of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to the most\\r\\n      erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the\\r\\n      surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to his pursuers; and from\\r\\n      time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory\\r\\n      speculations regarding them, especially concerning the mystic modes\\r\\n      whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he transports himself with such\\r\\n      vast swiftness to the most widely distant points.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and as\\r\\n      well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby, that\\r\\n      some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose bodies\\r\\n      have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas. Nor is\\r\\n      it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has been declared\\r\\n      that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded\\r\\n      very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some\\r\\n      whalemen, that the Nor&rsquo; West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never\\r\\n      a problem to the whale. So that here, in the real living experience of\\r\\n      living men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello\\r\\n      mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in which\\r\\n      the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still more\\r\\n      wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose waters were\\r\\n      believed to have come from the Holy Land by an underground passage); these\\r\\n      fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the\\r\\n      whalemen.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing\\r\\n      that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped alive;\\r\\n      it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still\\r\\n      further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous,\\r\\n      but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that though groves\\r\\n      of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still swim away\\r\\n      unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood, such a\\r\\n      sight would be but a ghastly deception; for again in unensanguined billows\\r\\n      hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in\\r\\n      the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the\\r\\n      imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk\\r\\n      that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales, but, as was\\r\\n      elsewhere thrown out&mdash;a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a\\r\\n      high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent features; the\\r\\n      tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he revealed his\\r\\n      identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the\\r\\n      same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive\\r\\n      appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by his\\r\\n      vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea,\\r\\n      leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden\\r\\n      gleamings.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his\\r\\n      deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror,\\r\\n      as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific\\r\\n      accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults. More than\\r\\n      all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught\\r\\n      else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers, with every apparent\\r\\n      symptom of alarm, he had several times been known to turn round suddenly,\\r\\n      and, bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or\\r\\n      drive them back in consternation to their ship.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar\\r\\n      disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in the\\r\\n      fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale&rsquo;s infernal\\r\\n      aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death that he caused,\\r\\n      was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent\\r\\n      agent.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of his\\r\\n      more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed boats,\\r\\n      and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the white curds\\r\\n      of the whale&rsquo;s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating sunlight, that\\r\\n      smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the\\r\\n      eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had\\r\\n      dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking\\r\\n      with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale. That\\r\\n      captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping his\\r\\n      sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab&rsquo;s leg,\\r\\n      as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk, no hired\\r\\n      Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming malice. Small\\r\\n      reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal\\r\\n      encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale, all\\r\\n      the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to\\r\\n      identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual\\r\\n      and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam before him as the\\r\\n      monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men\\r\\n      feel eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and\\r\\n      half a lung. That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning;\\r\\n      to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one-half of the\\r\\n      worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue\\r\\n      devil;&mdash;Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them; but\\r\\n      deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he pitted\\r\\n      himself, all mutilated, against it. All that most maddens and torments;\\r\\n      all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all\\r\\n      that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of\\r\\n      life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and\\r\\n      made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale&rsquo;s white\\r\\n      hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from\\r\\n      Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot\\r\\n      heart&rsquo;s shell upon it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the\\r\\n      precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the monster,\\r\\n      knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal\\r\\n      animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but\\r\\n      felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more. Yet, when by this\\r\\n      collision forced to turn towards home, and for long months of days and\\r\\n      weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock, rounding in\\r\\n      mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his\\r\\n      torn body and gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made\\r\\n      him mad. That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the\\r\\n      encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from\\r\\n      the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic;\\r\\n      and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his\\r\\n      Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium, that his\\r\\n      mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in\\r\\n      his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the\\r\\n      gales. And, when running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with\\r\\n      mild stun&rsquo;sails spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all\\r\\n      appearances, the old man&rsquo;s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape\\r\\n      Horn swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light\\r\\n      and air; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale,\\r\\n      and issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the\\r\\n      direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved\\r\\n      on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you\\r\\n      think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler\\r\\n      form. Ahab&rsquo;s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like\\r\\n      the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but\\r\\n      unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing\\r\\n      monomania, not one jot of Ahab&rsquo;s broad madness had been left behind; so in\\r\\n      that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural intellect had\\r\\n      perished. That before living agent, now became the living instrument. If\\r\\n      such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general\\r\\n      sanity, and carried it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own\\r\\n      mad mark; so that far from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one\\r\\n      end, did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely\\r\\n      brought to bear upon any one reasonable object.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      This is much; yet Ahab&rsquo;s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted. But\\r\\n      vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding far\\r\\n      down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we\\r\\n      here stand&mdash;however grand and wonderful, now quit it;&mdash;and take\\r\\n      your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;\\r\\n      where far beneath the fantastic towers of man&rsquo;s upper earth, his root of\\r\\n      grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique buried\\r\\n      beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken throne, the\\r\\n      great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits,\\r\\n      upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages. Wind ye down\\r\\n      there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king! A family\\r\\n      likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from your\\r\\n      grim sire only will the old State-secret come.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means are\\r\\n      sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or change,\\r\\n      or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble;\\r\\n      in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling was only\\r\\n      subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate. Nevertheless,\\r\\n      so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when with ivory leg he\\r\\n      stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but\\r\\n      naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the terrible casualty which\\r\\n      had overtaken him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly\\r\\n      ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which\\r\\n      always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present\\r\\n      voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely, that far\\r\\n      from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on account of\\r\\n      such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent isle were\\r\\n      inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he was all the\\r\\n      better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full of rage and\\r\\n      wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and scorched without,\\r\\n      with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea; such an one,\\r\\n      could he be found, would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his\\r\\n      lance against the most appalling of all brutes. Or, if for any reason\\r\\n      thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one would\\r\\n      seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the\\r\\n      attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad secret\\r\\n      of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had purposely sailed\\r\\n      upon the present voyage with the one only and all-engrossing object of\\r\\n      hunting the White Whale. Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but\\r\\n      half dreamed of what was lurking in him then, how soon would their aghast\\r\\n      and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They\\r\\n      were bent on profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars\\r\\n      from the mint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and\\r\\n      supernatural revenge.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a\\r\\n      Job&rsquo;s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made up\\r\\n      of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals&mdash;morally enfeebled\\r\\n      also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in\\r\\n      Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in\\r\\n      Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so officered,\\r\\n      seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him\\r\\n      to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so aboundingly responded\\r\\n      to the old man&rsquo;s ire&mdash;by what evil magic their souls were possessed,\\r\\n      that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale as much their\\r\\n      insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be&mdash;what the White\\r\\n      Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings, also, in\\r\\n      some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the gliding great demon of\\r\\n      the seas of life,&mdash;all this to explain, would be to dive deeper than\\r\\n      Ishmael can go. The subterranean miner that works in us all, how can one\\r\\n      tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his\\r\\n      pick? Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a\\r\\n      seventy-four can stand still? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment\\r\\n      of the time and the place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the\\r\\n      whale, could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0042\" id=\"link2HCH0042\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 42. The Whiteness of the Whale.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he was\\r\\n      to me, as yet remains unsaid.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which\\r\\n      could not but occasionally awaken in any man&rsquo;s soul some alarm, there was\\r\\n      another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which at\\r\\n      times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and yet so\\r\\n      mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of putting\\r\\n      it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of the whale that above\\r\\n      all things appalled me. But how can I hope to explain myself here; and\\r\\n      yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must, else all these\\r\\n      chapters might be naught.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as\\r\\n      if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas, and\\r\\n      pearls; and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain\\r\\n      royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu\\r\\n      placing the title &ldquo;Lord of the White Elephants&rdquo; above all their other\\r\\n      magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings of Siam\\r\\n      unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard; and the\\r\\n      Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white charger; and the\\r\\n      great Austrian Empire, CÃ¦sarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the\\r\\n      imperial colour the same imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it\\r\\n      applies to the human race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership\\r\\n      over every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been\\r\\n      even made significant of gladness, for among the Romans a white stone\\r\\n      marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and\\r\\n      symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching, noble\\r\\n      things&mdash;the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though among\\r\\n      the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the\\r\\n      deepest pledge of honor; though in many climes, whiteness typifies the\\r\\n      majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and contributes to the\\r\\n      daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds; though even in\\r\\n      the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the\\r\\n      symbol of the divine spotlessness and power; by the Persian fire\\r\\n      worshippers, the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar;\\r\\n      and in the Greek mythologies, Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a\\r\\n      snow-white bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice\\r\\n      of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology,\\r\\n      that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could\\r\\n      send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity;\\r\\n      and though directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian priests\\r\\n      derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic,\\r\\n      worn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish\\r\\n      faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of\\r\\n      our Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the\\r\\n      redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the\\r\\n      great white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool;\\r\\n      yet for all these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and\\r\\n      honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the\\r\\n      innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than\\r\\n      that redness which affrights in blood.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when\\r\\n      divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object\\r\\n      terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds.\\r\\n      Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics;\\r\\n      what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors\\r\\n      they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent\\r\\n      mildness, even more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb gloating of their\\r\\n      aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so\\r\\n      stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark.*\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      *With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who\\r\\n      would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the whiteness,\\r\\n      separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that\\r\\n      brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said, only\\r\\n      rises from the circumstance, that the irresponsible ferociousness of the\\r\\n      creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love;\\r\\n      and hence, by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds,\\r\\n      the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast. But even\\r\\n      assuming all this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you\\r\\n      would not have that intensified terror.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that\\r\\n      creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the\\r\\n      same quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly hit\\r\\n      by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish mass for\\r\\n      the dead begins with &ldquo;Requiem eternam&rdquo; (eternal rest), whence <i>Requiem</i>\\r\\n      denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music. Now, in\\r\\n      allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark, and the\\r\\n      mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him <i>Requin</i>.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual\\r\\n      wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all\\r\\n      imaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God&rsquo;s great,\\r\\n      unflattering laureate, Nature.*\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      *I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged\\r\\n      gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch\\r\\n      below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the main\\r\\n      hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and with a\\r\\n      hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its vast\\r\\n      archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings and\\r\\n      throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some\\r\\n      king&rsquo;s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its inexpressible, strange\\r\\n      eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God. As Abraham\\r\\n      before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white, its wings\\r\\n      so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the miserable\\r\\n      warping memories of traditions and of towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy\\r\\n      of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the things that darted through\\r\\n      me then. But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a sailor what bird was\\r\\n      this. A goney, he replied. Goney! never had heard that name before; is it\\r\\n      conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore!\\r\\n      never! But some time after, I learned that goney was some seaman&rsquo;s name\\r\\n      for albatross. So that by no possibility could Coleridge&rsquo;s wild Rhyme have\\r\\n      had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine, when I\\r\\n      saw that bird upon our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor\\r\\n      knew the bird to be an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly\\r\\n      burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly\\r\\n      lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this, that by a\\r\\n      solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses; and these I\\r\\n      have frequently seen, but never with such emotions as when I beheld the\\r\\n      Antarctic fowl.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will tell;\\r\\n      with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea. At last\\r\\n      the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern tally round\\r\\n      its neck, with the ship&rsquo;s time and place; and then letting it escape. But\\r\\n      I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was taken off in Heaven,\\r\\n      when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding, the invoking, and\\r\\n      adoring cherubim!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the\\r\\n      White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger, large-eyed,\\r\\n      small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs\\r\\n      in his lofty, overscorning carriage. He was the elected Xerxes of vast\\r\\n      herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the\\r\\n      Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At their flaming head he westward\\r\\n      trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of\\r\\n      light. The flashing cascade of his mane, the curving comet of his tail,\\r\\n      invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters\\r\\n      could have furnished him. A most imperial and archangelical apparition of\\r\\n      that unfallen, western world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and\\r\\n      hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked\\r\\n      majestic as a god, bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether\\r\\n      marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that\\r\\n      endlessly streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his\\r\\n      circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White Steed\\r\\n      gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool\\r\\n      milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to the bravest\\r\\n      Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe. Nor can it be\\r\\n      questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse, that\\r\\n      it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him with\\r\\n      divineness; and that this divineness had that in it which, though\\r\\n      commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that\\r\\n      accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and\\r\\n      Albatross.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks\\r\\n      the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is\\r\\n      that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he bears.\\r\\n      The Albino is as well made as other men&mdash;has no substantive deformity&mdash;and\\r\\n      yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him more strangely\\r\\n      hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be so?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not the\\r\\n      less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this crowning\\r\\n      attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the gauntleted ghost of\\r\\n      the Southern Seas has been denominated the White Squall. Nor, in some\\r\\n      historic instances, has the art of human malice omitted so potent an\\r\\n      auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in\\r\\n      Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their faction, the\\r\\n      desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the market-place!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all mankind\\r\\n      fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It cannot well be\\r\\n      doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most\\r\\n      appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering there; as if indeed that\\r\\n      pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world, as\\r\\n      of mortal trepidation here. And from that pallor of the dead, we borrow\\r\\n      the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our\\r\\n      superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our\\r\\n      phantoms; all ghosts rising in a milk-white fog&mdash;Yea, while these\\r\\n      terrors seize us, let us add, that even the king of terrors, when\\r\\n      personified by the evangelist, rides on his pallid horse.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing\\r\\n      he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized\\r\\n      significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to\\r\\n      account for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by the\\r\\n      citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness&mdash;though\\r\\n      for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct\\r\\n      associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful, but nevertheless,\\r\\n      is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however modified;&mdash;can we\\r\\n      thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause\\r\\n      we seek?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Let us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety, and\\r\\n      without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And\\r\\n      though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about to\\r\\n      be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were\\r\\n      entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able to\\r\\n      recall them now.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely\\r\\n      acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare mention\\r\\n      of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary, speechless\\r\\n      processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded with new-fallen\\r\\n      snow? Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American\\r\\n      States, why does the passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun,\\r\\n      evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings\\r\\n      (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White Tower of\\r\\n      London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled\\r\\n      American, than those other storied structures, its neighbors&mdash;the\\r\\n      Byward Tower, or even the Bloody? And those sublimer towers, the White\\r\\n      Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar moods, comes that gigantic\\r\\n      ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name, while the\\r\\n      thought of Virginia&rsquo;s Blue Ridge is full of a soft, dewy, distant\\r\\n      dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes, does the\\r\\n      name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy, while that\\r\\n      of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild\\r\\n      afternoons on the waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of\\r\\n      sunsets? Or, to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed\\r\\n      to the fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does\\r\\n      &ldquo;the tall pale man&rdquo; of the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor\\r\\n      unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves&mdash;why is this\\r\\n      phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling\\r\\n      earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the tearlessness\\r\\n      of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning\\r\\n      spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop (like canted yards of\\r\\n      anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues of house-walls lying over upon\\r\\n      each other, as a tossed pack of cards;&mdash;it is not these things alone\\r\\n      which make tearless Lima, the strangest, saddest city thou can&rsquo;st see. For\\r\\n      Lima has taken the white veil; and there is a higher horror in this\\r\\n      whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro, this whiteness keeps her ruins for\\r\\n      ever new; admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay; spreads\\r\\n      over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its\\r\\n      own distortions.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness is\\r\\n      not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects\\r\\n      otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror\\r\\n      in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely\\r\\n      consists in this one phenomenon, especially when exhibited under any form\\r\\n      at all approaching to muteness or universality. What I mean by these two\\r\\n      statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following\\r\\n      examples.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if by\\r\\n      night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels just\\r\\n      enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under precisely\\r\\n      similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to view his ship\\r\\n      sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness&mdash;as if from\\r\\n      encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him,\\r\\n      then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded phantom of the\\r\\n      whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in vain the lead\\r\\n      assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm they both go down;\\r\\n      he never rests till blue water is under him again. Yet where is the\\r\\n      mariner who will tell thee, &ldquo;Sir, it was not so much the fear of striking\\r\\n      hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the\\r\\n      snow-howdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the mere\\r\\n      fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast\\r\\n      altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to\\r\\n      lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same is it with the\\r\\n      backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative indifference views an\\r\\n      unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig to\\r\\n      break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding the\\r\\n      scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal trick of\\r\\n      legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and half\\r\\n      shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery,\\r\\n      views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean\\r\\n      ice monuments and splintered crosses.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is but a\\r\\n      white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a hypo,\\r\\n      Ishmael.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of\\r\\n      Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey&mdash;why is it that upon the\\r\\n      sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that he\\r\\n      cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness&mdash;why\\r\\n      will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies\\r\\n      of affright? There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild\\r\\n      creatures in his green northern home, so that the strange muskiness he\\r\\n      smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of\\r\\n      former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt, of the black\\r\\n      bisons of distant Oregon?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      No: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the\\r\\n      knowledge of the demonism in the world. Though thousands of miles from\\r\\n      Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending, goring bison\\r\\n      herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies, which\\r\\n      this instant they may be trampling into dust.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings of\\r\\n      the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the windrowed\\r\\n      snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking of that\\r\\n      buffalo robe to the frightened colt!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic\\r\\n      sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere\\r\\n      those things must exist. Though in many of its aspects this visible world\\r\\n      seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in fright.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and learned\\r\\n      why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange and far more\\r\\n      portentous&mdash;why, as we have seen, it is at once the most meaning\\r\\n      symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the Christian&rsquo;s Deity;\\r\\n      and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent in things the most\\r\\n      appalling to mankind.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and\\r\\n      immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the\\r\\n      thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way?\\r\\n      Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the\\r\\n      visible absence of colour; and at the same time the concrete of all\\r\\n      colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness, full\\r\\n      of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows&mdash;a colourless, all-colour of\\r\\n      atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory of\\r\\n      the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues&mdash;every stately\\r\\n      or lovely emblazoning&mdash;the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods;\\r\\n      yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of\\r\\n      young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent in\\r\\n      substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified Nature\\r\\n      absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the\\r\\n      charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that the\\r\\n      mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great\\r\\n      principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless in itself, and if\\r\\n      operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips\\r\\n      and roses, with its own blank tinge&mdash;pondering all this, the palsied\\r\\n      universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful travellers in Lapland,\\r\\n      who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes, so the\\r\\n      wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that\\r\\n      wraps all the prospect around him. And of all these things the Albino\\r\\n      whale was the symbol.

In this manner, they passed the buckets to\\r\\n      fill the scuttle-butt.

The Chart.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that\\r\\n      took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose\\r\\n      with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom, and\\r\\n      bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts, spread them\\r\\n      before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating himself before it, you\\r\\n      would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which\\r\\n      there met his eye; and with slow but steady pencil trace additional\\r\\n      courses over spaces that before were blank. At intervals, he would refer\\r\\n      to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein were set down the seasons\\r\\n      and places in which, on various former voyages of various ships, sperm\\r\\n      whales had been captured or seen.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his\\r\\n      head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever threw\\r\\n      shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till it\\r\\n      almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on\\r\\n      the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and\\r\\n      courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his\\r\\n      cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were\\r\\n      brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and others\\r\\n      were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before him, Ahab\\r\\n      was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to the more\\r\\n      certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans, it\\r\\n      might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary\\r\\n      creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem to\\r\\n      Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby calculating\\r\\n      the driftings of the sperm whale&rsquo;s food; and, also, calling to mind the\\r\\n      regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes;\\r\\n      could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to certainties,\\r\\n      concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of\\r\\n      his prey.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm\\r\\n      whale&rsquo;s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe that, could\\r\\n      he be closely observed and studied throughout the world; were the logs for\\r\\n      one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated, then the\\r\\n      migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in\\r\\n      invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows.\\r\\n      On this hint, attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory\\r\\n      charts of the sperm whale.*\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n<pre xml:space=\"preserve\">\\r\\n     *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne\\r\\n     out by an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of\\r\\n     the National Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By\\r\\n     that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is in\\r\\n     course of completion; and portions of it are presented in\\r\\n     the circular. &ldquo;This chart divides the ocean into districts\\r\\n     of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude;\\r\\n     perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve\\r\\n     columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each\\r\\n     of which districts are three lines; one to show the number\\r\\n     of days that have been spent in each month in every\\r\\n     district, and the two others to show the number of days in\\r\\n     which whales, sperm or right, have been seen.&rdquo;\\r\\n </pre>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the\\r\\n      sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct&mdash;say, rather, secret\\r\\n      intelligence from the Deity&mdash;mostly swim in <i>veins</i>, as they are\\r\\n      called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such\\r\\n      undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart,\\r\\n      with one tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the\\r\\n      direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor&rsquo;s parallel, and\\r\\n      though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable,\\r\\n      straight wake, yet the arbitrary <i>vein</i> in which at these times he is said\\r\\n      to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width (more or less, as the\\r\\n      vein is presumed to expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual\\r\\n      sweep from the whale-ship&rsquo;s mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along\\r\\n      this magic zone. The sum is, that at particular seasons within that\\r\\n      breadth and along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be\\r\\n      looked for.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\\r\\n      feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing\\r\\n      the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his art,\\r\\n      so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly\\r\\n      without prospect of a meeting.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\\r\\n      delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality, perhaps.\\r\\n      Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for\\r\\n      particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds\\r\\n      which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year, say, will\\r\\n      turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the\\r\\n      preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances\\r\\n      where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the same remark,\\r\\n      only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries and hermits among\\r\\n      the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though Moby Dick had in a former\\r\\n      year been seen, for example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the\\r\\n      Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow,\\r\\n      that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent\\r\\n      corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there. So, too,\\r\\n      with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed himself.\\r\\n      But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to\\r\\n      speak, not his places of prolonged abode. And where Ahab&rsquo;s chances of\\r\\n      accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only\\r\\n      been made to whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere\\r\\n      a particular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities would\\r\\n      become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the\\r\\n      next thing to a certainty. That particular set time and place were\\r\\n      conjoined in the one technical phrase&mdash;the Season-on-the-Line. For\\r\\n      there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been\\r\\n      periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun,\\r\\n      in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of\\r\\n      the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with the\\r\\n      white whale had taken place; there the waves were storied with his deeds;\\r\\n      there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the\\r\\n      awful motive to his vengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and\\r\\n      unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this\\r\\n      unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon\\r\\n      the one crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to\\r\\n      those hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize\\r\\n      his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the\\r\\n      Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her commander\\r\\n      to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and then running\\r\\n      down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to\\r\\n      cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season. Yet the\\r\\n      premature hour of the Pequod&rsquo;s sailing had, perhaps, been correctly\\r\\n      selected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion of things. Because,\\r\\n      an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days and nights was before\\r\\n      him; an interval which, instead of impatiently enduring ashore, he would\\r\\n      spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his\\r\\n      vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should\\r\\n      turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or\\r\\n      China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons,\\r\\n      Pampas, Nor&rsquo;-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and\\r\\n      Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the\\r\\n      Pequod&rsquo;s circumnavigating wake.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not\\r\\n      but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary\\r\\n      whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of individual\\r\\n      recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged\\r\\n      thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar snow-white brow of\\r\\n      Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be unmistakable. And\\r\\n      have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to himself, as after\\r\\n      poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself\\r\\n      back in reveries&mdash;tallied him, and shall he escape? His broad fins\\r\\n      are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep&rsquo;s ear! And here, his mad\\r\\n      mind would run on in a breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of\\r\\n      pondering came over him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to\\r\\n      recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man\\r\\n      endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps\\r\\n      with clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid\\r\\n      dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through the\\r\\n      day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them round\\r\\n      and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing of his\\r\\n      life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes the\\r\\n      case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base, and\\r\\n      a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked flames and lightnings\\r\\n      shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them; when\\r\\n      this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through\\r\\n      the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as\\r\\n      though escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead\\r\\n      of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright at\\r\\n      his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at\\r\\n      such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the\\r\\n      white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent\\r\\n      that so caused him to burst from it in horror again. The latter was the\\r\\n      eternal, living principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time\\r\\n      dissociated from the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it\\r\\n      for its outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the\\r\\n      scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was\\r\\n      no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with\\r\\n      the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab&rsquo;s case, yielding up\\r\\n      all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose, by\\r\\n      its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and devils\\r\\n      into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its own. Nay, could\\r\\n      grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to which it was conjoined,\\r\\n      fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth. Therefore,\\r\\n      the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab\\r\\n      rushed from his room, was for the time but a vacated thing, a formless\\r\\n      somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to be sure, but without an\\r\\n      object to colour, and therefore a blankness in itself. God help thee, old\\r\\n      man, thy thoughts have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense\\r\\n      thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for\\r\\n      ever; that vulture the very creature he creates.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0045\" id=\"link2HCH0045\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 45. The Affidavit.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed, as\\r\\n      indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in\\r\\n      the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in its earlier part, is\\r\\n      as important a one as will be found in this volume; but the leading matter\\r\\n      of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon, in\\r\\n      order to be adequately understood, and moreover to take away any\\r\\n      incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in\\r\\n      some minds, as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be\\r\\n      content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items,\\r\\n      practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from these\\r\\n      citations, I take it&mdash;the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow\\r\\n      of itself.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after\\r\\n      receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an\\r\\n      interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the\\r\\n      same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same private\\r\\n      cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where three years\\r\\n      intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I think it may\\r\\n      have been something more than that; the man who darted them happening, in\\r\\n      the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore\\r\\n      there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior,\\r\\n      where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by\\r\\n      serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common\\r\\n      perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions. Meanwhile,\\r\\n      the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it\\r\\n      had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the\\r\\n      coasts of Africa; but to no purpose. This man and this whale again came\\r\\n      together, and the one vanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known\\r\\n      three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw the whales\\r\\n      struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons with the respective\\r\\n      marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year\\r\\n      instance, it so fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and\\r\\n      last, and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole\\r\\n      under the whale&rsquo;s eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I\\r\\n      say three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are\\r\\n      three instances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have\\r\\n      heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter\\r\\n      there is no good ground to impeach.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant\\r\\n      the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable\\r\\n      historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at\\r\\n      distant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became\\r\\n      thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily\\r\\n      peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar in\\r\\n      that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his\\r\\n      peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly\\r\\n      valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences of\\r\\n      the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a\\r\\n      whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen\\r\\n      were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he\\r\\n      would be discovered lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to\\r\\n      cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some poor devils ashore that\\r\\n      happen to know an irascible great man, they make distant unobtrusive\\r\\n      salutations to him in the street, lest if they pursued the acquaintance\\r\\n      further, they might receive a summary thump for their presumption.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual\\r\\n      celebrity&mdash;Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he\\r\\n      famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death, but\\r\\n      he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions of a\\r\\n      name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or CÃ¦sar. Was it not so, O\\r\\n      Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so long\\r\\n      did&rsquo;st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was oft seen\\r\\n      from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O New Zealand Jack! thou\\r\\n      terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the\\r\\n      Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan, whose lofty jet they\\r\\n      say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky?\\r\\n      Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked like an old\\r\\n      tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In plain prose, here are\\r\\n      four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or\\r\\n      Sylla to the classic scholar.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various\\r\\n      times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were\\r\\n      finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed by\\r\\n      valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with that express\\r\\n      object as much in view, as in setting out through the Narragansett Woods,\\r\\n      Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious\\r\\n      murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the Indian King Philip.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make\\r\\n      mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in\\r\\n      printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole\\r\\n      story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For this is one\\r\\n      of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much\\r\\n      bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest\\r\\n      and most palpable wonders of the world, that without some hints touching\\r\\n      the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the fishery, they might\\r\\n      scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still worse and more\\r\\n      detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general\\r\\n      perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid\\r\\n      conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur. One\\r\\n      reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and\\r\\n      deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at home,\\r\\n      however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you suppose\\r\\n      that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by the\\r\\n      whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to the\\r\\n      bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan&mdash;do you suppose that that\\r\\n      poor fellow&rsquo;s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read\\r\\n      to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very irregular\\r\\n      between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be\\r\\n      called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell you\\r\\n      that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many\\r\\n      others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which had had a death\\r\\n      by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that had each lost a\\r\\n      boat&rsquo;s crew. For God&rsquo;s sake, be economical with your lamps and candles!\\r\\n      not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man&rsquo;s blood was spilled\\r\\n      for it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is\\r\\n      an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that when\\r\\n      narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness,\\r\\n      they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness; when, I\\r\\n      declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses,\\r\\n      when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon\\r\\n      testimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm\\r\\n      Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously\\r\\n      malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy, and\\r\\n      sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale <i>has</i> done it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket, was\\r\\n      cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her boats,\\r\\n      and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of the whales\\r\\n      were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping from the boats,\\r\\n      issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the ship. Dashing his\\r\\n      forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that in less than &ldquo;ten\\r\\n      minutes&rdquo; she settled down and fell over. Not a surviving plank of her has\\r\\n      been seen since. After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the\\r\\n      land in their boats. Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once\\r\\n      more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods\\r\\n      shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second time\\r\\n      his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never\\r\\n      tempted it since. At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket.\\r\\n      I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the\\r\\n      tragedy; I have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed\\r\\n      with his son; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the\\r\\n      catastrophe.*\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      *The following are extracts from Chace&rsquo;s narrative: &ldquo;Every fact seemed to\\r\\n      warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed\\r\\n      his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at a short\\r\\n      interval between them, both of which, according to their direction, were\\r\\n      calculated to do us the most injury, by being made ahead, and thereby\\r\\n      combining the speed of the two objects for the shock; to effect which, the\\r\\n      exact manÅ\\x93uvres which he made were necessary. His aspect was most\\r\\n      horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury. He came directly from\\r\\n      the shoal which we had just before entered, and in which we had struck\\r\\n      three of his companions, as if fired with revenge for their sufferings.&rdquo;\\r\\n       Again: &ldquo;At all events, the whole circumstances taken together, all\\r\\n      happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the time, impressions in\\r\\n      my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many\\r\\n      of which impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that\\r\\n      I am correct in my opinion.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a black\\r\\n      night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable\\r\\n      shore. &ldquo;The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the fears of\\r\\n      being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon hidden rocks,\\r\\n      with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation, seemed\\r\\n      scarcely entitled to a moment&rsquo;s thought; the dismal looking wreck, and <i>the\\r\\n      horrid aspect and revenge of the whale</i>, wholly engrossed my reflections,\\r\\n      until day again made its appearance.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In another place&mdash;p. 45,&mdash;he speaks of &ldquo;<i>the mysterious and\\r\\n      mortal attack of the animal</i>.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807 totally\\r\\n      lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic particulars of\\r\\n      this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter, though from the whale\\r\\n      hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions to it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J&mdash;&mdash;, then\\r\\n      commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be\\r\\n      dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in the\\r\\n      harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales, the\\r\\n      Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength\\r\\n      ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily\\r\\n      denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war\\r\\n      as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very good; but there is\\r\\n      more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set sail in this impregnable\\r\\n      craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm\\r\\n      whale, that begged a few moments&rsquo; confidential business with him. That\\r\\n      business consisted in fetching the Commodore&rsquo;s craft such a thwack, that\\r\\n      with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave\\r\\n      down and repair. I am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore&rsquo;s\\r\\n      interview with that whale as providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus\\r\\n      converted from unbelief by a similar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale\\r\\n      will stand no nonsense.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I will now refer you to Langsdorff&rsquo;s Voyages for a little circumstance in\\r\\n      point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you must\\r\\n      know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern&rsquo;s famous\\r\\n      Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century. Captain\\r\\n      Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day we\\r\\n      were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was very\\r\\n      clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on\\r\\n      our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was not till\\r\\n      the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up. An uncommon\\r\\n      large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship itself, lay almost\\r\\n      at the surface of the water, but was not perceived by any one on board\\r\\n      till the moment when the ship, which was in full sail, was almost upon\\r\\n      him, so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him. We\\r\\n      were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature,\\r\\n      setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.\\r\\n      The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below\\r\\n      all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck upon\\r\\n      some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost\\r\\n      gravity and solemnity. Captain D&rsquo;Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to\\r\\n      examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock,\\r\\n      but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, the Captain D&rsquo;Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in\\r\\n      question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual adventures\\r\\n      as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of Dorchester near\\r\\n      Boston. I have the honor of being a nephew of his. I have particularly\\r\\n      questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff. He substantiates\\r\\n      every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large one: a Russian\\r\\n      craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my uncle after\\r\\n      bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full, too,\\r\\n      of honest wonders&mdash;the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient\\r\\n      Dampier&rsquo;s old chums&mdash;I found a little matter set down so like that\\r\\n      just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a\\r\\n      corroborative example, if such be needed.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Lionel, it seems, was on his way to &ldquo;John Ferdinando,&rdquo; as he calls the\\r\\n      modern Juan Fernandes. &ldquo;In our way thither,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;about four o&rsquo;clock\\r\\n      in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the\\r\\n      Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our men in such\\r\\n      consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to\\r\\n      think; but every one began to prepare for death. And, indeed, the shock\\r\\n      was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted the ship had struck\\r\\n      against a rock; but when the amazement was a little over, we cast the\\r\\n      lead, and sounded, but found no ground. * * * * * The suddenness of the shock\\r\\n      made the guns leap in their carriages, and several of the men were shaken\\r\\n      out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was\\r\\n      thrown out of his cabin!&rdquo; Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an\\r\\n      earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a\\r\\n      great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great\\r\\n      mischief along the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the\\r\\n      darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all caused\\r\\n      by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to\\r\\n      me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more\\r\\n      than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing\\r\\n      boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long\\r\\n      withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship\\r\\n      Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let me\\r\\n      say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running\\r\\n      sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and secured\\r\\n      there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a horse walks\\r\\n      off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm\\r\\n      whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often\\r\\n      with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his\\r\\n      pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his\\r\\n      character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and\\r\\n      retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes. But I\\r\\n      must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration; a\\r\\n      remarkable and most significant one, by which you will not fail to see,\\r\\n      that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by\\r\\n      plain facts of the present day, but that these marvels (like all marvels)\\r\\n      are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for the millionth time we say\\r\\n      amen with Solomon&mdash;Verily there is nothing new under the sun.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate of\\r\\n      Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius\\r\\n      general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work every\\r\\n      way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he has always been\\r\\n      considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian, except in some\\r\\n      one or two particulars, not at all affecting the matter presently to be\\r\\n      mentioned.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term of\\r\\n      his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured in the\\r\\n      neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed vessels\\r\\n      at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years. A fact\\r\\n      thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid. Nor is\\r\\n      there any reason it should be. Of what precise species this sea-monster\\r\\n      was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as well as for other\\r\\n      reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a\\r\\n      sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long time I fancied that the\\r\\n      sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep\\r\\n      waters connecting with it. Even now I am certain that those seas are not,\\r\\n      and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a place\\r\\n      for his habitual gregarious resort. But further investigations have\\r\\n      recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been isolated\\r\\n      instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am\\r\\n      told, on good authority, that on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of\\r\\n      the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of\\r\\n      war readily passes through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by\\r\\n      the same route, pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance\\r\\n      called <i>brit</i> is to be found, the aliment of the right whale. But I have\\r\\n      every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale&mdash;squid or\\r\\n      cuttle-fish&mdash;lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large\\r\\n      creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at\\r\\n      its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements together, and\\r\\n      reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to all\\r\\n      human reasoning, Procopius&rsquo;s sea-monster, that for half a century stove\\r\\n      the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a sperm\\r\\n      whale.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0046\" id=\"link2HCH0046\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 46. Surmises.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his\\r\\n      thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick;\\r\\n      though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one\\r\\n      passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long\\r\\n      habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman&rsquo;s ways, altogether to\\r\\n      abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if this were\\r\\n      otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more influential with\\r\\n      him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even considering his\\r\\n      monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White Whale might\\r\\n      have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that\\r\\n      the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances\\r\\n      that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one\\r\\n      he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there were\\r\\n      still additional considerations which, though not so strictly according\\r\\n      with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no means incapable of\\r\\n      swaying him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in the\\r\\n      shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew, for\\r\\n      example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over\\r\\n      Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any\\r\\n      more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership; for\\r\\n      to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal\\r\\n      relation. Starbuck&rsquo;s body and Starbuck&rsquo;s coerced will were Ahab&rsquo;s, so long\\r\\n      as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck&rsquo;s brain; still he knew that for all\\r\\n      this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain&rsquo;s quest, and could\\r\\n      he, would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it. It\\r\\n      might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen.\\r\\n      During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open\\r\\n      relapses of rebellion against his captain&rsquo;s leadership, unless some\\r\\n      ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon\\r\\n      him. Not only that, but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick\\r\\n      was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and\\r\\n      shrewdness in foreseeing that, for the present, the hunt should in some\\r\\n      way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally\\r\\n      invested it; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn\\r\\n      into the obscure background (for few men&rsquo;s courage is proof against\\r\\n      protracted meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their\\r\\n      long night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to\\r\\n      think of than Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage\\r\\n      crew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all\\r\\n      sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable&mdash;they live in the\\r\\n      varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness&mdash;and when\\r\\n      retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however\\r\\n      promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things\\r\\n      requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and\\r\\n      hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion\\r\\n      mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.\\r\\n      The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought\\r\\n      Ahab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the\\r\\n      hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even\\r\\n      breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for the\\r\\n      love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for\\r\\n      their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and chivalric\\r\\n      Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of\\r\\n      land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without committing burglaries,\\r\\n      picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by the way. Had they\\r\\n      been strictly held to their one final and romantic object&mdash;that final\\r\\n      and romantic object, too many would have turned from in disgust. I will\\r\\n      not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of cash&mdash;aye, cash.\\r\\n      They may scorn cash now; but let some months go by, and no perspective\\r\\n      promise of it to them, and then this same quiescent cash all at once\\r\\n      mutinying in them, this same cash would soon cashier Ahab.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to\\r\\n      Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps somewhat\\r\\n      prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the Pequod&rsquo;s voyage,\\r\\n      Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he had indirectly laid\\r\\n      himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation; and with perfect\\r\\n      impunity, both moral and legal, his crew if so disposed, and to that end\\r\\n      competent, could refuse all further obedience to him, and even violently\\r\\n      wrest from him the command. From even the barely hinted imputation of\\r\\n      usurpation, and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression\\r\\n      gaining ground, Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect\\r\\n      himself. That protection could only consist in his own predominating brain\\r\\n      and heart and hand, backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to\\r\\n      every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to\\r\\n      be subjected to.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally\\r\\n      developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree\\r\\n      continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod&rsquo;s voyage;\\r\\n      observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force himself to\\r\\n      evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of\\r\\n      his profession.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three\\r\\n      mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit\\r\\n      reporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0047\" id=\"link2HCH0047\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging about\\r\\n      the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters. Queequeg\\r\\n      and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat, for an\\r\\n      additional lashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet somehow\\r\\n      preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie lurked in\\r\\n      the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible\\r\\n      self.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I kept\\r\\n      passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long\\r\\n      yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as Queequeg,\\r\\n      standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the\\r\\n      threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly and unthinkingly\\r\\n      drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign\\r\\n      all over the ship and all over the sea, only broken by the intermitting\\r\\n      dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this were the Loom of Time,\\r\\n      and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the\\r\\n      Fates. There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single,\\r\\n      ever returning, unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to\\r\\n      admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own. This\\r\\n      warp seemed necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own\\r\\n      shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime,\\r\\n      Queequeg&rsquo;s impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof\\r\\n      slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be;\\r\\n      and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding\\r\\n      contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage&rsquo;s sword,\\r\\n      thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this\\r\\n      easy, indifferent sword must be chance&mdash;aye, chance, free will, and\\r\\n      necessity&mdash;nowise incompatible&mdash;all interweavingly working\\r\\n      together. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its\\r\\n      ultimate course&mdash;its every alternating vibration, indeed, only\\r\\n      tending to that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given\\r\\n      threads; and chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines\\r\\n      of necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though\\r\\n      thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the last\\r\\n      featuring blow at events.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so\\r\\n      strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of\\r\\n      free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence\\r\\n      that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees was that mad\\r\\n      Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly forward, his hand\\r\\n      stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden intervals he continued his\\r\\n      cries. To be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard\\r\\n      all over the seas, from hundreds of whalemen&rsquo;s look-outs perched as high\\r\\n      in the air; but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have\\r\\n      derived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indian&rsquo;s.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and eagerly\\r\\n      peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some prophet or\\r\\n      seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries announcing\\r\\n      their coming.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Where-away?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Instantly all was commotion.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and\\r\\n      reliable uniformity. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other\\r\\n      tribes of his genus.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;There go flukes!&rdquo; was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales\\r\\n      disappeared.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Quick, steward!&rdquo; cried Ahab. &ldquo;Time! time!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact\\r\\n      minute to Ahab.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling\\r\\n      before it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to\\r\\n      leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of\\r\\n      our bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale\\r\\n      when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while\\r\\n      concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in the\\r\\n      opposite quarter&mdash;this deceitfulness of his could not now be in\\r\\n      action; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego\\r\\n      had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our vicinity. One of\\r\\n      the men selected for shipkeepers&mdash;that is, those not appointed to the\\r\\n      boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head. The sailors\\r\\n      at the fore and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in their\\r\\n      places; the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed, and the three\\r\\n      boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs.\\r\\n      Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail,\\r\\n      while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale. So look the long\\r\\n      line of man-of-war&rsquo;s men about to throw themselves on board an enemy&rsquo;s\\r\\n      ship.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took\\r\\n      every eye from the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was\\r\\n      surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0048\" id=\"link2HCH0048\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 48. The First Lowering.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side of\\r\\n      the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the tackles\\r\\n      and bands of the boat which swung there. This boat had always been deemed\\r\\n      one of the spare boats, though technically called the captain&rsquo;s, on\\r\\n      account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. The figure that now\\r\\n      stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white tooth evilly\\r\\n      protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese jacket of black\\r\\n      cotton funereally invested him, with wide black trowsers of the same dark\\r\\n      stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited\\r\\n      turban, the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head.\\r\\n      Less swart in aspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid,\\r\\n      tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the\\r\\n      Manillas;&mdash;a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and\\r\\n      by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret\\r\\n      confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord, whose\\r\\n      counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      While yet the wondering ship&rsquo;s company were gazing upon these strangers,\\r\\n      Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head, &ldquo;All ready\\r\\n      there, Fedallah?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; was the half-hissed reply.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Lower away then; d&rsquo;ye hear?&rdquo; shouting across the deck. &ldquo;Lower away there,\\r\\n      I say.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men\\r\\n      sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with a\\r\\n      wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a dexterous,\\r\\n      off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the sailors, goat-like,\\r\\n      leaped down the rolling ship&rsquo;s side into the tossed boats below.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship&rsquo;s lee, when a fourth keel,\\r\\n      coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and showed\\r\\n      the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the stern, loudly\\r\\n      hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves widely, so as to\\r\\n      cover a large expanse of water. But with all their eyes again riveted upon\\r\\n      the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of the other boats obeyed not\\r\\n      the command.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Captain Ahab?&mdash;&rdquo; said Starbuck.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Spread yourselves,&rdquo; cried Ahab; &ldquo;give way, all four boats. Thou, Flask,\\r\\n      pull out more to leeward!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rdquo; cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his great\\r\\n      steering oar. &ldquo;Lay back!&rdquo; addressing his crew. &ldquo;There!&mdash;there!&mdash;there\\r\\n      again! There she blows right ahead, boys!&mdash;lay back!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind &rsquo;em, sir,&rdquo; said Archy; &ldquo;I knew it\\r\\n      all before now. Didn&rsquo;t I hear &rsquo;em in the hold? And didn&rsquo;t I\\r\\n      tell Cabaco here of it? What say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr. Flask.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little\\r\\n      ones,&rdquo; drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of whom\\r\\n      still showed signs of uneasiness. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you break your backbones, my\\r\\n      boys? What is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They are\\r\\n      only five more hands come to help us&mdash;never mind from where&mdash;the\\r\\n      more the merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone&mdash;devils\\r\\n      are good fellows enough. So, so; there you are now; that&rsquo;s the stroke for\\r\\n      a thousand pounds; that&rsquo;s the stroke to sweep the stakes! Hurrah for the\\r\\n      gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers, men&mdash;all hearts\\r\\n      alive! Easy, easy; don&rsquo;t be in a hurry&mdash;don&rsquo;t be in a hurry. Why\\r\\n      don&rsquo;t you snap your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so,\\r\\n      so, then:&mdash;softly, softly! That&rsquo;s it&mdash;that&rsquo;s it! long and\\r\\n      strong. Give way there, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin\\r\\n      rapscallions; ye are all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull.\\r\\n      Pull, will ye? pull, can&rsquo;t ye? pull, won&rsquo;t ye? Why in the name of gudgeons\\r\\n      and ginger-cakes don&rsquo;t ye pull?&mdash;pull and break something! pull, and\\r\\n      start your eyes out! Here!&rdquo; whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle;\\r\\n      &ldquo;every mother&rsquo;s son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the blade between\\r\\n      his teeth. That&rsquo;s it&mdash;that&rsquo;s it. Now ye do something; that looks like\\r\\n      it, my steel-bits. Start her&mdash;start her, my silver-spoons! Start her,\\r\\n      marling-spikes!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Stubb&rsquo;s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had rather\\r\\n      a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in\\r\\n      inculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this\\r\\n      specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions\\r\\n      with his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief\\r\\n      peculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a tone\\r\\n      so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so calculated\\r\\n      merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear such queer\\r\\n      invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling for the mere\\r\\n      joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent\\r\\n      himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so broadly gaped&mdash;open-mouthed\\r\\n      at times&mdash;that the mere sight of such a yawning commander, by sheer\\r\\n      force of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew. Then again, Stubb was\\r\\n      one of those odd sort of humorists, whose jollity is sometimes so\\r\\n      curiously ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter\\r\\n      of obeying them.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely\\r\\n      across Stubb&rsquo;s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty\\r\\n      near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye\\r\\n      please!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Halloa!&rdquo; returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he spoke;\\r\\n      still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set like a\\r\\n      flint from Stubb&rsquo;s.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,\\r\\n      boys!)&rdquo; in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: &ldquo;A sad\\r\\n      business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind,\\r\\n      Mr. Stubb, all for the best. Let all your crew pull strong, come what\\r\\n      will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There&rsquo;s hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr.\\r\\n      Stubb, and that&rsquo;s what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm&rsquo;s the\\r\\n      play! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in hand.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, aye, I thought as much,&rdquo; soliloquized Stubb, when the boats\\r\\n      diverged, &ldquo;as soon as I clapt eye on &rsquo;em, I thought so. Aye, and that&rsquo;s\\r\\n      what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long\\r\\n      suspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whale&rsquo;s at the bottom of\\r\\n      it. Well, well, so be it! Can&rsquo;t be helped! All right! Give way, men! It\\r\\n      ain&rsquo;t the White Whale to-day! Give way!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as\\r\\n      the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably\\r\\n      awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship&rsquo;s company;\\r\\n      but Archy&rsquo;s fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among\\r\\n      them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some small measure\\r\\n      prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge of their wonder;\\r\\n      and so what with all this and Stubb&rsquo;s confident way of accounting for\\r\\n      their appearance, they were for the time freed from superstitious\\r\\n      surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of\\r\\n      wild conjectures as to dark Ahab&rsquo;s precise agency in the matter from the\\r\\n      beginning. For me, I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen\\r\\n      creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the\\r\\n      enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the furthest\\r\\n      to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a circumstance\\r\\n      bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger yellow creatures\\r\\n      of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five trip-hammers they rose\\r\\n      and fell with regular strokes of strength, which periodically started the\\r\\n      boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi\\r\\n      steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had\\r\\n      thrown aside his black jacket, and displayed his naked chest with the\\r\\n      whole part of his body above the gunwale, clearly cut against the\\r\\n      alternating depressions of the watery horizon; while at the other end of\\r\\n      the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer&rsquo;s, thrown half backward into\\r\\n      the air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip; Ahab was seen\\r\\n      steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the\\r\\n      White Whale had torn him. All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar\\r\\n      motion and then remained fixed, while the boat&rsquo;s five oars were seen\\r\\n      simultaneously peaked. Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly\\r\\n      the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way. The whales had\\r\\n      irregularly settled bodily down into the blue, thus giving no distantly\\r\\n      discernible token of the movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab\\r\\n      had observed it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Every man look out along his oars!&rdquo; cried Starbuck. &ldquo;Thou, Queequeg,\\r\\n      stand up!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage\\r\\n      stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the\\r\\n      spot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme\\r\\n      stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the\\r\\n      gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself\\r\\n      to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently eyeing the\\r\\n      vast blue eye of the sea.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Not very far distant Flask&rsquo;s boat was also lying breathlessly still; its\\r\\n      commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a stout sort\\r\\n      of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above the level of\\r\\n      the stern platform. It is used for catching turns with the whale line. Its\\r\\n      top is not more spacious than the palm of a man&rsquo;s hand, and standing upon\\r\\n      such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the mast-head of some ship\\r\\n      which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little King-Post was small and\\r\\n      short, and at the same time little King-Post was full of a large and tall\\r\\n      ambition, so that this loggerhead stand-point of his did by no means\\r\\n      satisfy King-Post.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to\\r\\n      that.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way,\\r\\n      swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty\\r\\n      shoulders for a pedestal.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you\\r\\n      fifty feet taller.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the\\r\\n      boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to\\r\\n      Flask&rsquo;s foot, and then putting Flask&rsquo;s hand on his hearse-plumed head and\\r\\n      bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous fling\\r\\n      landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders. And here was Flask\\r\\n      now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband\\r\\n      to lean against and steady himself by.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous\\r\\n      habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture\\r\\n      in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and\\r\\n      cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the\\r\\n      loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the sight of little Flask\\r\\n      mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself\\r\\n      with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble\\r\\n      negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his\\r\\n      broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked\\r\\n      nobler than the rider. Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious\\r\\n      little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience; but not one added\\r\\n      heave did he thereby give to the negro&rsquo;s lordly chest. So have I seen\\r\\n      Passion and Vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth\\r\\n      did not alter her tides and her seasons for that.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing solicitudes.\\r\\n      The whales might have made one of their regular soundings, not a temporary\\r\\n      dive from mere fright; and if that were the case, Stubb, as his wont in\\r\\n      such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the languishing interval with\\r\\n      his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband, where he always wore it aslant\\r\\n      like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed home the loading with his\\r\\n      thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper\\r\\n      of his hand, when Tashtego, his harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to\\r\\n      windward like two fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect\\r\\n      attitude to his seat, crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, &ldquo;Down, down\\r\\n      all, and give way!&mdash;there they are!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been\\r\\n      visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white\\r\\n      water, and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and\\r\\n      suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white\\r\\n      rolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it were,\\r\\n      like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this\\r\\n      atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of\\r\\n      water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other\\r\\n      indications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their forerunning\\r\\n      couriers and detached flying outriders.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water\\r\\n      and air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as a mass\\r\\n      of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Pull, pull, my good boys,&rdquo; said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but\\r\\n      intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance\\r\\n      from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two\\r\\n      visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much to\\r\\n      his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the silence\\r\\n      of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar\\r\\n      whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      How different the loud little King-Post. &ldquo;Sing out and say something, my\\r\\n      hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on their\\r\\n      black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I&rsquo;ll sign over to you my\\r\\n      Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children, boys. Lay\\r\\n      me on&mdash;lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring mad!\\r\\n      See! see that white water!&rdquo; And so shouting, he pulled his hat from his\\r\\n      head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up, flirted it far\\r\\n      off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat&rsquo;s\\r\\n      stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Look at that chap now,&rdquo; philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his\\r\\n      unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a short\\r\\n      distance, followed after&mdash;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got fits, that Flask has. Fits? yes,\\r\\n      give him fits&mdash;that&rsquo;s the very word&mdash;pitch fits into &rsquo;em.\\r\\n      Merrily, merrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you know;&mdash;merry&rsquo;s\\r\\n      the word. Pull, babes&mdash;pull, sucklings&mdash;pull, all. But what the\\r\\n      devil are you hurrying about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only\\r\\n      pull, and keep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and bite\\r\\n      your knives in two&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. Take it easy&mdash;why don&rsquo;t ye take\\r\\n      it easy, I say, and burst all your livers and lungs!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of\\r\\n      his&mdash;these were words best omitted here; for you live under the\\r\\n      blessed light of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the\\r\\n      audacious seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and\\r\\n      eyes of red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Meanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of Flask\\r\\n      to &ldquo;that whale,&rdquo; as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to\\r\\n      be incessantly tantalizing his boat&rsquo;s bow with its tail&mdash;these\\r\\n      allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that they would\\r\\n      cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the\\r\\n      shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen must put out\\r\\n      their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks; usage pronouncing that\\r\\n      they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but arms, in these\\r\\n      critical moments.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the\\r\\n      omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled along\\r\\n      the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green; the\\r\\n      brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip for an instant on the\\r\\n      knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost seemed threatening to\\r\\n      cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows;\\r\\n      the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill; the\\r\\n      headlong, sled-like slide down its other side;&mdash;all these, with the\\r\\n      cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and the shuddering gasps of the\\r\\n      oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her\\r\\n      boats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her screaming brood;&mdash;all\\r\\n      this was thrilling.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever\\r\\n      heat of his first battle; not the dead man&rsquo;s ghost encountering the first\\r\\n      unknown phantom in the other world;&mdash;neither of these can feel\\r\\n      stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first time\\r\\n      finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the hunted sperm\\r\\n      whale.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more\\r\\n      visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows flung\\r\\n      upon the sea. The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted everywhere\\r\\n      to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes. The boats\\r\\n      were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead\\r\\n      to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still rising wind, we\\r\\n      rushed along; the boat going with such madness through the water, that the\\r\\n      lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from\\r\\n      the row-locks.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither ship\\r\\n      nor boat to be seen.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Give way, men,&rdquo; whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the sheet\\r\\n      of his sail; &ldquo;there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes.\\r\\n      There&rsquo;s white water again!&mdash;close to! Spring!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that\\r\\n      the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when with a\\r\\n      lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: &ldquo;Stand up!&rdquo; and Queequeg,\\r\\n      harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so\\r\\n      close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the\\r\\n      mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent instant had\\r\\n      come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants\\r\\n      stirring in their litter. Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the\\r\\n      mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of\\r\\n      enraged serpents.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s his hump. <i>There</i>, <i>there</i>, give it to him!&rdquo; whispered Starbuck.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of\\r\\n      Queequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from\\r\\n      astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail\\r\\n      collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by;\\r\\n      something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole crew\\r\\n      were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the white\\r\\n      curdling cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all blended\\r\\n      together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round it\\r\\n      we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,\\r\\n      tumbled back to our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea, the\\r\\n      water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing eyes\\r\\n      the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of\\r\\n      the ocean.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together;\\r\\n      the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white fire\\r\\n      upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal in these\\r\\n      jaws of death! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar to the live\\r\\n      coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that\\r\\n      storm. Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the\\r\\n      shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen. The rising sea\\r\\n      forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars were useless as\\r\\n      propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers. So, cutting the\\r\\n      lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many failures Starbuck\\r\\n      contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then stretching it on a waif\\r\\n      pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this forlorn hope.\\r\\n      There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that\\r\\n      almighty forlornness. There, then, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man\\r\\n      without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat, we\\r\\n      lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over the\\r\\n      sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat. Suddenly\\r\\n      Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear. We all heard\\r\\n      a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm. The\\r\\n      sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge,\\r\\n      vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last\\r\\n      loomed into view, bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much\\r\\n      more than its length.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it\\r\\n      tossed and gaped beneath the ship&rsquo;s bows like a chip at the base of a\\r\\n      cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no more\\r\\n      till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were dashed\\r\\n      against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely landed on\\r\\n      board. Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut loose from\\r\\n      their fish and returned to the ship in good time. The ship had given us\\r\\n      up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon some token of our\\r\\n      perishing,&mdash;an oar or a lance pole.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0049\" id=\"link2HCH0049\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 49. The Hyena.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair\\r\\n      we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical\\r\\n      joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more than suspects\\r\\n      that the joke is at nobody&rsquo;s expense but his own. However, nothing\\r\\n      dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing. He bolts down all\\r\\n      events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all hard things visible\\r\\n      and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich of potent digestion\\r\\n      gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for small difficulties and\\r\\n      worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril of life and limb; all\\r\\n      these, and death itself, seem to him only sly, good-natured hits, and\\r\\n      jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old\\r\\n      joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of, comes over a man\\r\\n      only in some time of extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst of\\r\\n      his earnestness, so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing\\r\\n      most momentous, now seems but a part of the general joke. There is nothing\\r\\n      like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial,\\r\\n      desperado philosophy; and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the\\r\\n      Pequod, and the great White Whale its object.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Queequeg,&rdquo; said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the deck,\\r\\n      and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water;\\r\\n      &ldquo;Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often happen?&rdquo; Without\\r\\n      much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he gave me to understand\\r\\n      that such things did often happen.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Mr. Stubb,&rdquo; said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his\\r\\n      oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; &ldquo;Mr. Stubb, I\\r\\n      think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief\\r\\n      mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I suppose\\r\\n      then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy\\r\\n      squall is the height of a whaleman&rsquo;s discretion?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Certain. I&rsquo;ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off Cape\\r\\n      Horn.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Mr. Flask,&rdquo; said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing close\\r\\n      by; &ldquo;you are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you tell me\\r\\n      whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask, for an\\r\\n      oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into death&rsquo;s\\r\\n      jaws?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you twist that smaller?&rdquo; said Flask. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the law. I should\\r\\n      like to see a boat&rsquo;s crew backing water up to a whale face foremost. Ha,\\r\\n      ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind that!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement of\\r\\n      the entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings in\\r\\n      the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of common\\r\\n      occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the superlatively\\r\\n      critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign my life into the\\r\\n      hands of him who steered the boat&mdash;oftentimes a fellow who at that\\r\\n      very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft\\r\\n      with his own frantic stampings; considering that the particular disaster\\r\\n      to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck&rsquo;s driving\\r\\n      on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall, and considering that\\r\\n      Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his great heedfulness in the\\r\\n      fishery; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent Starbuck&rsquo;s\\r\\n      boat; and finally considering in what a devil&rsquo;s chase I was implicated,\\r\\n      touching the White Whale: taking all things together, I say, I thought I\\r\\n      might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will. &ldquo;Queequeg,&rdquo; said\\r\\n      I, &ldquo;come along, you shall be my lawyer, executor, and legatee.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their\\r\\n      last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world more fond\\r\\n      of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had\\r\\n      done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded upon the present\\r\\n      occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled away from my heart.\\r\\n      Besides, all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that\\r\\n      Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a supplementary clean gain of so\\r\\n      many months or weeks as the case might be. I survived myself; my death and\\r\\n      burial were locked up in my chest. I looked round me tranquilly and\\r\\n      contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the\\r\\n      bars of a snug family vault.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock,\\r\\n      here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the\\r\\n      devil fetch the hindmost.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0050\" id=\"link2HCH0050\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 50. Ahab&rsquo;s Boat and Crew. Fedallah.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Who would have thought it, Flask!&rdquo; cried Stubb; &ldquo;if I had but one leg you\\r\\n      would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug-hole with my\\r\\n      timber toe. Oh! he&rsquo;s a wonderful old man!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it so strange, after all, on that account,&rdquo; said Flask. &ldquo;If\\r\\n      his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing. That\\r\\n      would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the other left,\\r\\n      you know.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering the\\r\\n      paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it is right\\r\\n      for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the\\r\\n      chase. So Tamerlane&rsquo;s soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes,\\r\\n      whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest\\r\\n      of the fight.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that\\r\\n      with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;\\r\\n      considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and\\r\\n      extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then\\r\\n      comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man\\r\\n      to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the joint-owners of\\r\\n      the Pequod must have plainly thought not.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his\\r\\n      entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the\\r\\n      chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his\\r\\n      orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned\\r\\n      to him as a regular headsman in the hunt&mdash;above all for Captain Ahab\\r\\n      to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat&rsquo;s crew, he well knew\\r\\n      that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the\\r\\n      Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boat&rsquo;s crew from them, nor had he\\r\\n      in any way hinted his desires on that head. Nevertheless he had taken\\r\\n      private measures of his own touching all that matter. Until Cabaco&rsquo;s\\r\\n      published discovery, the sailors had little foreseen it, though to be sure\\r\\n      when, after being a little while out of port, all hands had concluded the\\r\\n      customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service; when some time\\r\\n      after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of\\r\\n      making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the\\r\\n      spare boats, and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which\\r\\n      when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when\\r\\n      all this was observed in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an\\r\\n      extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better\\r\\n      withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety he\\r\\n      evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is\\r\\n      sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat&rsquo;s bow for bracing the\\r\\n      knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was observed how\\r\\n      often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the\\r\\n      semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the carpenter&rsquo;s chisel\\r\\n      gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there; all these\\r\\n      things, I say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time. But\\r\\n      almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in\\r\\n      Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he\\r\\n      had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person.\\r\\n      But such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as\\r\\n      to any boat&rsquo;s crew being assigned to that boat.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned away;\\r\\n      for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such\\r\\n      unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown\\r\\n      nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers;\\r\\n      and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found\\r\\n      tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck, oars, whaleboats,\\r\\n      canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that Beelzebub himself\\r\\n      might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the\\r\\n      captain, and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the\\r\\n      forecastle.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate\\r\\n      phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were\\r\\n      somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a\\r\\n      muffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like this,\\r\\n      by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked\\r\\n      with Ahab&rsquo;s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort of a\\r\\n      half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even authority\\r\\n      over him; all this none knew. But one cannot sustain an indifferent air\\r\\n      concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as civilized, domestic people\\r\\n      in the temperate zone only see in their dreams, and that but dimly; but\\r\\n      the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic\\r\\n      communities, especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continent&mdash;those\\r\\n      insulated, immemorial, unalterable countries, which even in these modern\\r\\n      days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth&rsquo;s primal\\r\\n      generations, when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection,\\r\\n      and all men his descendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as\\r\\n      real phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and\\r\\n      to what end; when though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed\\r\\n      consorted with the daughters of men, the devils also, add the uncanonical\\r\\n      Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0051\" id=\"link2HCH0051\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 51. The Spirit-Spout.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly swept\\r\\n      across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off the Cape de\\r\\n      Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of the Rio de la\\r\\n      Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery locality, southerly from\\r\\n      St. Helena.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and\\r\\n      moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver; and,\\r\\n      by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery silence,\\r\\n      not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in\\r\\n      advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it looked\\r\\n      celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea.\\r\\n      Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight nights, it was\\r\\n      his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a look-out there, with\\r\\n      the same precision as if it had been day. And yet, though herds of whales\\r\\n      were seen by night, not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering\\r\\n      for them. You may think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld this\\r\\n      old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and the moon,\\r\\n      companions in one sky. But when, after spending his uniform interval there\\r\\n      for several successive nights without uttering a single sound; when, after\\r\\n      all this silence, his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery,\\r\\n      moon-lit jet, every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some\\r\\n      winged spirit had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew.\\r\\n      &ldquo;There she blows!&rdquo; Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have\\r\\n      quivered more; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though\\r\\n      it was a most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so\\r\\n      deliriously exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively\\r\\n      desired a lowering.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the\\r\\n      t&rsquo;gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The best\\r\\n      man in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head manned, the\\r\\n      piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The strange, upheaving,\\r\\n      lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many\\r\\n      sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet;\\r\\n      while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic influences were\\r\\n      struggling in her&mdash;one to mount direct to heaven, the other to drive\\r\\n      yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched Ahab&rsquo;s face that\\r\\n      night, you would have thought that in him also two different things were\\r\\n      warring. While his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck, every\\r\\n      stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap. On life and death this\\r\\n      old man walked. But though the ship so swiftly sped, and though from every\\r\\n      eye, like arrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more\\r\\n      seen that night. Every sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days\\r\\n      after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it was\\r\\n      descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it\\r\\n      disappeared as if it had never been. And so it served us night after\\r\\n      night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously jetted into\\r\\n      the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be; disappearing\\r\\n      again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and somehow seeming at\\r\\n      every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our\\r\\n      van, this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance with\\r\\n      the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested the\\r\\n      Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and\\r\\n      wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however far apart\\r\\n      latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by one self-same\\r\\n      whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there reigned, too, a sense\\r\\n      of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as if it were treacherously\\r\\n      beckoning us on and on, in order that the monster might turn round upon\\r\\n      us, and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous\\r\\n      potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in which, beneath\\r\\n      all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a devilish charm, as for\\r\\n      days and days we voyaged along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely mild,\\r\\n      that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed vacating\\r\\n      itself of life before our urn-like prow.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began howling\\r\\n      around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas that are\\r\\n      there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast, and gored\\r\\n      the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of silver chips, the\\r\\n      foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this desolate vacuity of life\\r\\n      went away, but gave place to sights more dismal than before.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither\\r\\n      before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And\\r\\n      every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and\\r\\n      spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp, as\\r\\n      though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing\\r\\n      appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for their\\r\\n      homeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the black\\r\\n      sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great mundane soul\\r\\n      were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoso, as called of\\r\\n      yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended\\r\\n      us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where guilty\\r\\n      beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed condemned to\\r\\n      swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat that black air\\r\\n      without any horizon. But calm, snow-white, and unvarying; still directing\\r\\n      its fountain of feathers to the sky; still beckoning us on from before,\\r\\n      the solitary jet would at times be descried.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for the\\r\\n      time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck,\\r\\n      manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever addressed his\\r\\n      mates. In tempestuous times like these, after everything above and aloft\\r\\n      has been secured, nothing more can be done but passively to await the\\r\\n      issue of the gale. Then Captain and crew become practical fatalists. So,\\r\\n      with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole, and with one hand\\r\\n      firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead\\r\\n      to windward, while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but\\r\\n      congeal his very eyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven from the\\r\\n      forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over\\r\\n      its bows, stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better\\r\\n      to guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a\\r\\n      sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened\\r\\n      belt. Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by\\r\\n      painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift\\r\\n      madness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same muteness of\\r\\n      humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence the\\r\\n      men swung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the blast. Even\\r\\n      when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose\\r\\n      in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget the old man&rsquo;s aspect, when one\\r\\n      night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw\\r\\n      him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair; the rain\\r\\n      and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before\\r\\n      emerged, still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat. On the\\r\\n      table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents\\r\\n      which have previously been spoken of. His lantern swung from his tightly\\r\\n      clenched hand. Though the body was erect, the head was thrown back so that\\r\\n      the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that\\r\\n      swung from a beam in the ceiling.*\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      *The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to the\\r\\n      compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself of the\\r\\n      course of the ship.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Terrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this gale,\\r\\n      still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0052\" id=\"link2HCH0052\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 52. The Albatross.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising\\r\\n      ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross) by\\r\\n      name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head,\\r\\n      I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean\\r\\n      fisheries&mdash;a whaler at sea, and long absent from home.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the\\r\\n      skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral\\r\\n      appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all her\\r\\n      spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over\\r\\n      with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it was to see\\r\\n      her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They seemed clad in\\r\\n      the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived\\r\\n      nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast,\\r\\n      they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and though, when the ship\\r\\n      slowly glided close under our stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to\\r\\n      each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one\\r\\n      ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly\\r\\n      eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own look-outs, while\\r\\n      the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in the\\r\\n      act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his hand\\r\\n      into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to make\\r\\n      himself heard without it. Meantime his ship was still increasing the\\r\\n      distance between. While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod\\r\\n      were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere\\r\\n      mention of the White Whale&rsquo;s name to another ship, Ahab for a moment\\r\\n      paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board\\r\\n      the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But taking advantage\\r\\n      of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet, and knowing by her\\r\\n      aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home,\\r\\n      he loudly hailed&mdash;&ldquo;Ahoy there! This is the Pequod, bound round the\\r\\n      world! Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean! and\\r\\n      this time three years, if I am not at home, tell them to address them\\r\\n      to &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then, in\\r\\n      accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish, that\\r\\n      for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side, darted away\\r\\n      with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves fore and aft with\\r\\n      the stranger&rsquo;s flanks. Though in the course of his continual voyagings\\r\\n      Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight, yet, to any\\r\\n      monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Swim away from me, do ye?&rdquo; murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water.\\r\\n      There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep\\r\\n      helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. But\\r\\n      turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the\\r\\n      wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion voice,&mdash;&ldquo;Up\\r\\n      helm! Keep her off round the world!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Round the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings;\\r\\n      but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through\\r\\n      numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that we\\r\\n      left behind secure, were all the time before us.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for\\r\\n      ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange than\\r\\n      any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise in the\\r\\n      voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in tormented\\r\\n      chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims before all\\r\\n      human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they either lead\\r\\n      us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0053\" id=\"link2HCH0053\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 53. The Gam.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had\\r\\n      spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But even had this not\\r\\n      been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded her&mdash;judging\\r\\n      by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions&mdash;if so it had been\\r\\n      that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer to the\\r\\n      question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not to\\r\\n      consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain, except he could\\r\\n      contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought. But all this\\r\\n      might remain inadequately estimated, were not something said here of the\\r\\n      peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other in foreign\\r\\n      seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the\\r\\n      equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering each\\r\\n      other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of them,\\r\\n      cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment to\\r\\n      interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and resting\\r\\n      in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the illimitable Pine\\r\\n      Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling vessels descrying\\r\\n      each other at the ends of the earth&mdash;off lone Fanning&rsquo;s Island, or\\r\\n      the far away King&rsquo;s Mills; how much more natural, I say, that under such\\r\\n      circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails, but come into\\r\\n      still closer, more friendly and sociable contact. And especially would\\r\\n      this seem to be a matter of course, in the case of vessels owned in one\\r\\n      seaport, and whose captains, officers, and not a few of the men are\\r\\n      personally known to each other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear\\r\\n      domestic things to talk about.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on\\r\\n      board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date\\r\\n      a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn files.\\r\\n      And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound ship would receive the\\r\\n      latest whaling intelligence from the cruising-ground to which she may be\\r\\n      destined, a thing of the utmost importance to her. And in degree, all this\\r\\n      will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other&rsquo;s track on\\r\\n      the cruising-ground itself, even though they are equally long absent from\\r\\n      home. For one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some\\r\\n      third, and now far remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the\\r\\n      people of the ship she now meets. Besides, they would exchange the whaling\\r\\n      news, and have an agreeable chat. For not only would they meet with all\\r\\n      the sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar\\r\\n      congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared\\r\\n      privations and perils.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference; that\\r\\n      is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case with\\r\\n      Americans and English. Though, to be sure, from the small number of\\r\\n      English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when they do\\r\\n      occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them; for your\\r\\n      Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not fancy that\\r\\n      sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English whalers\\r\\n      sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American\\r\\n      whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his nondescript\\r\\n      provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this superiority in\\r\\n      the English whalemen does really consist, it would be hard to say, seeing\\r\\n      that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill more whales than all the\\r\\n      English, collectively, in ten years. But this is a harmless little foible\\r\\n      in the English whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does not take much to\\r\\n      heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few foibles himself.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the whalers\\r\\n      have most reason to be sociable&mdash;and they are so. Whereas, some\\r\\n      merchant ships crossing each other&rsquo;s wake in the mid-Atlantic, will\\r\\n      oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,\\r\\n      mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies in\\r\\n      Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism upon\\r\\n      each other&rsquo;s rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at sea, they\\r\\n      first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings, such a\\r\\n      ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be much right-down hearty\\r\\n      good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As touching Slave-ships\\r\\n      meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry, they run away from each\\r\\n      other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates, when they chance to cross\\r\\n      each other&rsquo;s cross-bones, the first hail is&mdash;&ldquo;How many skulls?&rdquo;&mdash;the\\r\\n      same way that whalers hail&mdash;&ldquo;How many barrels?&rdquo; And that question\\r\\n      once answered, pirates straightway steer apart, for they are infernal\\r\\n      villains on both sides, and don&rsquo;t like to see overmuch of each other&rsquo;s\\r\\n      villanous likenesses.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,\\r\\n      free-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another\\r\\n      whaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a &ldquo;<i>Gam</i>,&rdquo; a thing so utterly\\r\\n      unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even; and if\\r\\n      by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it, and repeat\\r\\n      gamesome stuff about &ldquo;spouters&rdquo; and &ldquo;blubber-boilers,&rdquo; and such like\\r\\n      pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and also all\\r\\n      Pirates and Man-of-War&rsquo;s men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish such a\\r\\n      scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it would be hard\\r\\n      to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should like to know\\r\\n      whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it. It\\r\\n      sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at the gallows. And\\r\\n      besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he has no proper\\r\\n      foundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I conclude, that in boasting\\r\\n      himself to be high lifted above a whaleman, in that assertion the pirate\\r\\n      has no solid basis to stand on.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But what is a <i>Gam?</i> You might wear out your index-finger running up and\\r\\n      down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word. Dr. Johnson\\r\\n      never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster&rsquo;s ark does not hold it.\\r\\n      Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years been in\\r\\n      constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees. Certainly, it\\r\\n      needs a definition, and should be incorporated into the Lexicon. With that\\r\\n      view, let me learnedly define it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      GAM. NOUN&mdash;<i>A social meeting of two</i> (<i>or more</i>) <i>Whaleships,\\r\\n      generally on a cruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange visits\\r\\n      by boats&rsquo; crews: the two captains remaining, for the time, on board of one\\r\\n      ship, and the two chief mates on the other.</i>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten\\r\\n      here. All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so\\r\\n      has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the\\r\\n      captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern sheets\\r\\n      on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often steers himself\\r\\n      with a pretty little milliner&rsquo;s tiller decorated with gay cords and\\r\\n      ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort\\r\\n      whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if whaling captains\\r\\n      were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent\\r\\n      chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such\\r\\n      effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat&rsquo;s crew must leave\\r\\n      the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number,\\r\\n      that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain,\\r\\n      having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing like a\\r\\n      pine tree. And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of\\r\\n      the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships,\\r\\n      this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his\\r\\n      dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor is this any very easy matter; for in\\r\\n      his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then\\r\\n      in the small of his back, the after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees\\r\\n      in front. He is thus completely wedged before and behind, and can only\\r\\n      expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a\\r\\n      sudden, violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because\\r\\n      length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make\\r\\n      a spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again, it\\r\\n      would never do in plain sight of the world&rsquo;s riveted eyes, it would never\\r\\n      do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the\\r\\n      slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands; indeed, as\\r\\n      token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he generally carries his hands\\r\\n      in his trowsers&rsquo; pockets; but perhaps being generally very large, heavy\\r\\n      hands, he carries them there for ballast. Nevertheless there have occurred\\r\\n      instances, well authenticated ones too, where the captain has been known\\r\\n      for an uncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden squall say&mdash;to\\r\\n      seize hold of the nearest oarsman&rsquo;s hair, and hold on there like grim\\r\\n      death.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0054\" id=\"link2HCH0054\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 54. The Town-Ho&rsquo;s Story.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      (<i>As told at the Golden Inn.</i>)\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is\\r\\n      much like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you meet more\\r\\n      travellers than in any other part.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another homeward-bound\\r\\n      whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She was manned almost wholly by\\r\\n      Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby\\r\\n      Dick. To some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly\\r\\n      heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho&rsquo;s story, which seemed\\r\\n      obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous, inverted\\r\\n      visitation of one of those so called judgments of God which at times are\\r\\n      said to overtake some men. This latter circumstance, with its own\\r\\n      particular accompaniments, forming what may be called the secret part of\\r\\n      the tragedy about to be narrated, never reached the ears of Captain Ahab\\r\\n      or his mates. For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain\\r\\n      of the Town-Ho himself. It was the private property of three confederate\\r\\n      white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to\\r\\n      Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy, but the following night\\r\\n      Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed so much of it in that way,\\r\\n      that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest.\\r\\n      Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen\\r\\n      in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it, and by such a strange\\r\\n      delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this matter, that they kept\\r\\n      the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod&rsquo;s\\r\\n      main-mast. Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the\\r\\n      story as publicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I\\r\\n      now proceed to put on lasting record.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      *The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head,\\r\\n      still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      For my humor&rsquo;s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated\\r\\n      it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one saint&rsquo;s eve,\\r\\n      smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn. Of those fine\\r\\n      cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were on the closer terms\\r\\n      with me; and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put, and\\r\\n      which are duly answered at the time.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about\\r\\n      rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket, was\\r\\n      cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days&rsquo; sail eastward from the\\r\\n      eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the northward of the\\r\\n      Line. One morning upon handling the pumps, according to daily usage, it\\r\\n      was observed that she made more water in her hold than common. They\\r\\n      supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But the captain, having\\r\\n      some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those\\r\\n      latitudes; and therefore being very averse to quit them, and the leak not\\r\\n      being then considered at all dangerous, though, indeed, they could not\\r\\n      find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather\\r\\n      heavy weather, the ship still continued her cruisings, the mariners\\r\\n      working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no good luck came;\\r\\n      more days went by, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered, but it\\r\\n      sensibly increased. So much so, that now taking some alarm, the captain,\\r\\n      making all sail, stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands,\\r\\n      there to have his hull hove out and repaired.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance\\r\\n      favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way,\\r\\n      because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically relieved at\\r\\n      them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free;\\r\\n      never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well nigh the whole\\r\\n      of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had\\r\\n      all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the\\r\\n      occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been for the brutal\\r\\n      overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked\\r\\n      vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Lakeman!&mdash;Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?&rsquo;\\r\\n      said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but&mdash;I crave your\\r\\n      courtesy&mdash;may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now,\\r\\n      gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as large\\r\\n      and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far Manilla;\\r\\n      this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had yet been\\r\\n      nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected\\r\\n      with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate, those grand\\r\\n      fresh-water seas of ours,&mdash;Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and\\r\\n      Superior, and Michigan,&mdash;possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with\\r\\n      many of the ocean&rsquo;s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of\\r\\n      races and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles,\\r\\n      even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by two great\\r\\n      contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime\\r\\n      approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East, dotted all\\r\\n      round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by batteries, and by\\r\\n      the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet\\r\\n      thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they yield their beaches to\\r\\n      wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry\\r\\n      wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered\\r\\n      forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic\\r\\n      genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of prey, and\\r\\n      silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors; they\\r\\n      mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as well as Winnebago\\r\\n      villages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship, the armed\\r\\n      cruiser of the State, the steamer, and the beech canoe; they are swept by\\r\\n      Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave;\\r\\n      they know what shipwrecks are, for out of sight of land, however inland,\\r\\n      they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew.\\r\\n      Thus, gentlemen, though an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and\\r\\n      wild-ocean nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for\\r\\n      Radney, though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone\\r\\n      Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had\\r\\n      long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was\\r\\n      he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman,\\r\\n      fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives. Yet was this\\r\\n      Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a\\r\\n      mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible\\r\\n      firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which\\r\\n      is the meanest slave&rsquo;s right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had long been\\r\\n      retained harmless and docile. At all events, he had proved so thus far;\\r\\n      but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt&mdash;but, gentlemen,\\r\\n      you shall hear.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow\\r\\n      for her island haven, that the Town-Ho&rsquo;s leak seemed again increasing, but\\r\\n      only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day. You must\\r\\n      know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic, for example,\\r\\n      some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it; though of\\r\\n      a still, sleepy night, should the officer of the deck happen to forget his\\r\\n      duty in that respect, the probability would be that he and his shipmates\\r\\n      would never again remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to\\r\\n      the bottom. Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the\\r\\n      westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging\\r\\n      at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable\\r\\n      length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any\\r\\n      other reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel\\r\\n      is in some very out of the way part of those waters, some really landless\\r\\n      latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found\\r\\n      gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by\\r\\n      several of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the\\r\\n      upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way expanded\\r\\n      to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a coward, and\\r\\n      as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his\\r\\n      own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or on sea that you\\r\\n      can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when he betrayed this\\r\\n      solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared that\\r\\n      it was only on account of his being a part owner in her. So when they were\\r\\n      working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small\\r\\n      gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet\\r\\n      continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any mountain\\r\\n      spring, gentlemen&mdash;that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck,\\r\\n      and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper-holes.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional\\r\\n      world of ours&mdash;watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in\\r\\n      command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his\\r\\n      superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he\\r\\n      conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a chance\\r\\n      he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern&rsquo;s tower, and make a little\\r\\n      heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all\\r\\n      events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman, and\\r\\n      a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy&rsquo;s\\r\\n      snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen,\\r\\n      which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born son to\\r\\n      Charlemagne&rsquo;s father. But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as\\r\\n      hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. He did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt\\r\\n      knew it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the\\r\\n      rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with his\\r\\n      gay banterings.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Aye, aye, my merry lads, it&rsquo;s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin, one\\r\\n      of ye, and let&rsquo;s have a taste. By the Lord, it&rsquo;s worth bottling! I tell ye\\r\\n      what, men, old Rad&rsquo;s investment must go for it! he had best cut away his\\r\\n      part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that sword-fish only\\r\\n      began the job; he&rsquo;s come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters,\\r\\n      saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole posse of &rsquo;em are now\\r\\n      hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom; making improvements, I\\r\\n      suppose. If old Rad were here now, I&rsquo;d tell him to jump overboard and\\r\\n      scatter &rsquo;em. They&rsquo;re playing the devil with his estate, I can tell him.\\r\\n      But he&rsquo;s a simple old soul,&mdash;Rad, and a beauty too. Boys, they say\\r\\n      the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses. I wonder if he&rsquo;d\\r\\n      give a poor devil like me the model of his nose.&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Damn your eyes! what&rsquo;s that pump stopping for?&rsquo; roared Radney,\\r\\n      pretending not to have heard the sailors&rsquo; talk. &lsquo;Thunder away at it!&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rsquo; said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. &lsquo;Lively, boys,\\r\\n      lively, now!&rsquo; And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines; the\\r\\n      men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping of the\\r\\n      lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life&rsquo;s utmost\\r\\n      energies.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went\\r\\n      forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face fiery\\r\\n      red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow. Now\\r\\n      what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney to meddle\\r\\n      with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know not; but so\\r\\n      it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate commanded him\\r\\n      to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a shovel, and remove\\r\\n      some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship&rsquo;s deck at sea is a piece of household\\r\\n      work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every\\r\\n      evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually\\r\\n      foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of\\r\\n      sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom\\r\\n      would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all\\r\\n      vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys, if\\r\\n      boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that\\r\\n      had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most\\r\\n      athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain\\r\\n      of one of the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any\\r\\n      trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the\\r\\n      case with his comrades. I mention all these particulars so that you may\\r\\n      understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as\\r\\n      plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat in\\r\\n      his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand\\r\\n      this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman fully comprehended\\r\\n      when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat still for a moment, and\\r\\n      as he steadfastly looked into the mate&rsquo;s malignant eye and perceived the\\r\\n      stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match silently\\r\\n      burning along towards them; as he instinctively saw all this, that strange\\r\\n      forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any\\r\\n      already ireful being&mdash;a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by\\r\\n      really valiant men even when aggrieved&mdash;this nameless phantom\\r\\n      feeling, gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\\r\\n      exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping the\\r\\n      deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then, without at\\r\\n      all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the customary\\r\\n      sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done little or nothing\\r\\n      all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a most domineering and\\r\\n      outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile\\r\\n      advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an uplifted cooper&rsquo;s club\\r\\n      hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for\\r\\n      all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt could\\r\\n      but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still smothering the\\r\\n      conflagration within him, without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to\\r\\n      his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few\\r\\n      inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do his bidding.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\\r\\n      followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated his\\r\\n      intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not the\\r\\n      slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted\\r\\n      hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it was to no\\r\\n      purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass;\\r\\n      when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had\\r\\n      now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the Lakeman paused on\\r\\n      the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to\\r\\n      yourself.&rsquo; But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where\\r\\n      the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his\\r\\n      teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.\\r\\n      Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye\\r\\n      with the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his right\\r\\n      hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his persecutor that\\r\\n      if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would murder him. But,\\r\\n      gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods.\\r\\n      Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant the lower jaw\\r\\n      of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood\\r\\n      like a whale.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays\\r\\n      leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their\\r\\n      mastheads. They were both Canallers.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Canallers!&rsquo; cried Don Pedro. &lsquo;We have seen many whale-ships in our\\r\\n      harbours, but never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and what are\\r\\n      they?&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal. You\\r\\n      must have heard of it.&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary\\r\\n      land, we know but little of your vigorous North.&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha&rsquo;s very fine; and ere\\r\\n      proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for such\\r\\n      information may throw side-light upon my story.&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire breadth\\r\\n      of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities and most\\r\\n      thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and affluent,\\r\\n      cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room and\\r\\n      bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman arches\\r\\n      over Indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or broken;\\r\\n      through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk counties;\\r\\n      and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires stand almost\\r\\n      like milestones, flows one continual stream of Venetianly corrupt and\\r\\n      often lawless life. There&rsquo;s your true Ashantee, gentlemen; there howl your\\r\\n      pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you; under the long-flung\\r\\n      shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches. For by some curious\\r\\n      fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they\\r\\n      ever encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentlemen, most\\r\\n      abound in holiest vicinities.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Is that a friar passing?&rsquo; said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the\\r\\n      crowded plazza, with humorous concern.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella&rsquo;s Inquisition wanes in\\r\\n      Lima,&rsquo; laughed Don Sebastian. &lsquo;Proceed, Senor.&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;A moment! Pardon!&rsquo; cried another of the company. &lsquo;In the name of all us\\r\\n      Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we have by no\\r\\n      means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for\\r\\n      distant Venice in your corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look\\r\\n      surprised; you know the proverb all along this coast&mdash;&ldquo;Corrupt as\\r\\n      Lima.&rdquo; It but bears out your saying, too; churches more plentiful than\\r\\n      billiard-tables, and for ever open&mdash;and &ldquo;Corrupt as Lima.&rdquo; So, too,\\r\\n      Venice; I have been there; the holy city of the blessed evangelist, St.\\r\\n      Mark!&mdash;St. Dominic, purge it! Your cup! Thanks: here I refill; now,\\r\\n      you pour out again.&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would make a\\r\\n      fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he. Like\\r\\n      Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery Nile, he\\r\\n      indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening\\r\\n      his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore, all this effeminacy is\\r\\n      dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly sports; his\\r\\n      slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features. A terror to\\r\\n      the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats; his swart\\r\\n      visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on\\r\\n      his own canal, I have received good turns from one of these Canallers; I\\r\\n      thank him heartily; would fain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of\\r\\n      the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence, that at times he\\r\\n      has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a\\r\\n      wealthy one. In sum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is,\\r\\n      is emphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so\\r\\n      many of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of mankind,\\r\\n      except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling captains. Nor\\r\\n      does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter, that to many\\r\\n      thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line, the\\r\\n      probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition between\\r\\n      quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and recklessly ploughing the\\r\\n      waters of the most barbaric seas.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;I see! I see!&rsquo; impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his chicha upon\\r\\n      his silvery ruffles. &lsquo;No need to travel! The world&rsquo;s one Lima. I had\\r\\n      thought, now, that at your temperate North the generations were cold and\\r\\n      holy as the hills.&mdash;But the story.&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay. Hardly had\\r\\n      he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four\\r\\n      harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down the ropes\\r\\n      like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the uproar, and sought\\r\\n      to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle. Others of the sailors\\r\\n      joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued; while\\r\\n      standing out of harm&rsquo;s way, the valiant captain danced up and down with a\\r\\n      whale-pike, calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious\\r\\n      scoundrel, and smoke him along to the quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran\\r\\n      close up to the revolving border of the confusion, and prying into the\\r\\n      heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his\\r\\n      resentment. But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all;\\r\\n      they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing\\r\\n      about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these\\r\\n      sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come out of that, ye pirates!&rsquo; roared the captain, now menacing them\\r\\n      with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. &lsquo;Come out\\r\\n      of that, ye cut-throats!&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there, defied\\r\\n      the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to understand\\r\\n      distinctly, that his (Steelkilt&rsquo;s) death would be the signal for a\\r\\n      murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart lest this\\r\\n      might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but still\\r\\n      commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?&rsquo; demanded their ringleader.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Turn to! turn to!&mdash;I make no promise;&mdash;to your duty! Do you\\r\\n      want to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!&rsquo; and\\r\\n      he once more raised a pistol.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sink the ship?&rsquo; cried Steelkilt. &lsquo;Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us\\r\\n      turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What say\\r\\n      ye, men?&rsquo; turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their response.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye on\\r\\n      the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:&mdash;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not our\\r\\n      fault; we didn&rsquo;t want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was boy&rsquo;s\\r\\n      business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to prick the\\r\\n      buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw;\\r\\n      ain&rsquo;t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there, men? look to\\r\\n      those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to yourself; say the\\r\\n      word; don&rsquo;t be a fool; forget it all; we are ready to turn to; treat us\\r\\n      decently, and we&rsquo;re your men; but we won&rsquo;t be flogged.&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Look ye, now,&rsquo; cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,\\r\\n      &lsquo;there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for\\r\\n      the cruise, d&rsquo;ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our\\r\\n      discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don&rsquo;t want a row; it&rsquo;s not\\r\\n      our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we won&rsquo;t\\r\\n      be flogged.&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Turn to!&rsquo; roared the Captain.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:&mdash;&lsquo;I tell you\\r\\n      what it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a\\r\\n      shabby rascal, we won&rsquo;t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but\\r\\n      till you say the word about not flogging us, we don&rsquo;t do a hand&rsquo;s turn.&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I&rsquo;ll keep ye there till\\r\\n      ye&rsquo;re sick of it. Down ye go.&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Shall we?&rsquo; cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against\\r\\n      it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down into\\r\\n      their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;As the Lakeman&rsquo;s bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain\\r\\n      and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide of\\r\\n      the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called for\\r\\n      the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the\\r\\n      companionway. Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something\\r\\n      down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them&mdash;ten in\\r\\n      number&mdash;leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had remained neutral.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and\\r\\n      aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at which\\r\\n      last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after breaking\\r\\n      through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed in peace; the\\r\\n      men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps, whose\\r\\n      clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally\\r\\n      resounded through the ship.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck, summoned\\r\\n      the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was then\\r\\n      lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed\\r\\n      after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it, the\\r\\n      Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three days this\\r\\n      was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling, and then a\\r\\n      scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered; and suddenly\\r\\n      four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to.\\r\\n      The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to\\r\\n      some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained them to surrender at\\r\\n      discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated his demand to the\\r\\n      rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling\\r\\n      and betake himself where he belonged. On the fifth morning three others of\\r\\n      the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that\\r\\n      sought to restrain them. Only three were left.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Better turn to, now?&rsquo; said the Captain with a heartless jeer.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Shut us up again, will ye!&rsquo; cried Steelkilt.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh certainly,&rsquo; said the Captain, and the key clicked.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of seven\\r\\n      of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had last\\r\\n      hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the\\r\\n      bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two\\r\\n      Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst out of their\\r\\n      hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with their keen\\r\\n      mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a handle at each\\r\\n      end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if by any\\r\\n      devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For himself, he\\r\\n      would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not. That was the last\\r\\n      night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met with no opposition\\r\\n      on the part of the other two; they swore they were ready for that, or for\\r\\n      any other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender. And what was\\r\\n      more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the time\\r\\n      to make the rush should come. But to this their leader as fiercely\\r\\n      objected, reserving that priority for himself; particularly as his two\\r\\n      comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the matter; and both of\\r\\n      them could not be first, for the ladder would but admit one man at a time.\\r\\n      And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants must come out.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own\\r\\n      separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece of\\r\\n      treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be the\\r\\n      first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and thereby\\r\\n      secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit. But when\\r\\n      Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last,\\r\\n      they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of villany, mixed their before\\r\\n      secret treacheries together; and when their leader fell into a doze,\\r\\n      verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences; and bound\\r\\n      the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with cords; and shrieked out for\\r\\n      the Captain at midnight.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and\\r\\n      all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a few\\r\\n      minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still\\r\\n      struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies,\\r\\n      who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe\\r\\n      for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along the deck like\\r\\n      dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the mizzen rigging,\\r\\n      like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till morning. &lsquo;Damn ye,&rsquo;\\r\\n      cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them, &lsquo;the vultures would not\\r\\n      touch ye, ye villains!&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had rebelled\\r\\n      from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the former that he\\r\\n      had a good mind to flog them all round&mdash;thought, upon the whole, he\\r\\n      would do so&mdash;he ought to&mdash;justice demanded it; but for the\\r\\n      present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with a\\r\\n      reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;But as for you, ye carrion rogues,&rsquo; turning to the three men in the\\r\\n      rigging&mdash;&lsquo;for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;&rsquo; and,\\r\\n      seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two\\r\\n      traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads\\r\\n      sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;My wrist is sprained with ye!&rsquo; he cried, at last; &lsquo;but there is still\\r\\n      rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn&rsquo;t give up. Take that\\r\\n      gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his\\r\\n      cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a sort\\r\\n      of hiss, &lsquo;What I say is this&mdash;and mind it well&mdash;if you flog me,\\r\\n      I murder you!&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me&rsquo;&mdash;and the Captain drew off\\r\\n      with the rope to strike.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Best not,&rsquo; hissed the Lakeman.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;But I must,&rsquo;&mdash;and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain;\\r\\n      who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck rapidly\\r\\n      two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope, said, &lsquo;I\\r\\n      won&rsquo;t do it&mdash;let him go&mdash;cut him down: d&rsquo;ye hear?&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale man,\\r\\n      with a bandaged head, arrested them&mdash;Radney the chief mate. Ever\\r\\n      since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the\\r\\n      tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the whole\\r\\n      scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly speak; but\\r\\n      mumbling something about <i>his</i> being willing and able to do what the captain\\r\\n      dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;You are a coward!&rsquo; hissed the Lakeman.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;So I am, but take that.&rsquo; The mate was in the very act of striking, when\\r\\n      another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing no more,\\r\\n      made good his word, spite of Steelkilt&rsquo;s threat, whatever that might have\\r\\n      been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were turned to, and,\\r\\n      sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps clanged as before.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor was\\r\\n      heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up,\\r\\n      besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.\\r\\n      Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own\\r\\n      instance they were put down in the ship&rsquo;s run for salvation. Still, no\\r\\n      sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed, that\\r\\n      mainly at Steelkilt&rsquo;s instigation, they had resolved to maintain the\\r\\n      strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the ship\\r\\n      reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the speediest\\r\\n      end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing&mdash;namely, not to\\r\\n      sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For, spite of her\\r\\n      leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her\\r\\n      mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that\\r\\n      moment, as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and\\r\\n      Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and\\r\\n      with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of\\r\\n      passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till all\\r\\n      was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who\\r\\n      had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief\\r\\n      mate&rsquo;s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half\\r\\n      way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted, against\\r\\n      the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head of his watch at\\r\\n      night. Upon this, and one or two other circumstances, Steelkilt\\r\\n      systematically built the plan of his revenge.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the\\r\\n      bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the\\r\\n      boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship&rsquo;s side. In this\\r\\n      attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a considerable\\r\\n      vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between this was the sea.\\r\\n      Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his next trick at the helm\\r\\n      would come round at two o&rsquo;clock, in the morning of the third day from that\\r\\n      in which he had been betrayed. At his leisure, he employed the interval in\\r\\n      braiding something very carefully in his watches below.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;What are you making there?&rsquo; said a shipmate.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;What do you think? what does it look like?&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Like a lanyard for your bag; but it&rsquo;s an odd one, seems to me.&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, rather oddish,&rsquo; said the Lakeman, holding it at arm&rsquo;s length before\\r\\n      him; &lsquo;but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven&rsquo;t enough twine,&mdash;have\\r\\n      you any?&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;But there was none in the forecastle.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then I must get some from old Rad;&rsquo; and he rose to go aft.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to go a begging to <i>him!</i>&rsquo; said a sailor.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why not? Do you think he won&rsquo;t do me a turn, when it&rsquo;s to help himself\\r\\n      in the end, shipmate?&rsquo; and going to the mate, he looked at him quietly,\\r\\n      and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given him&mdash;neither\\r\\n      twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an iron ball,\\r\\n      closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the Lakeman&rsquo;s monkey\\r\\n      jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow.\\r\\n      Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent helm&mdash;nigh to the\\r\\n      man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman&rsquo;s\\r\\n      hand&mdash;that fatal hour was then to come; and in the fore-ordaining\\r\\n      soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse,\\r\\n      with his forehead crushed in.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed\\r\\n      he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the\\r\\n      avenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in to\\r\\n      take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second\\r\\n      day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe man,\\r\\n      drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, &lsquo;There she\\r\\n      rolls! there she rolls!&rsquo; Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Moby Dick!&rsquo; cried Don Sebastian; &lsquo;St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do whales\\r\\n      have christenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;&mdash;but\\r\\n      that would be too long a story.&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;How? how?&rsquo; cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, Dons, Dons&mdash;nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me get\\r\\n      more into the air, Sirs.&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;The chicha! the chicha!&rsquo; cried Don Pedro; &lsquo;our vigorous friend looks\\r\\n      faint;&mdash;fill up his empty glass!&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.&mdash;Now, gentlemen, so\\r\\n      suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship&mdash;forgetful\\r\\n      of the compact among the crew&mdash;in the excitement of the moment, the\\r\\n      Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the\\r\\n      monster, though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from\\r\\n      the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy. &lsquo;The White Whale&mdash;the\\r\\n      White Whale!&rsquo; was the cry from captain, mates, and harpooneers, who,\\r\\n      undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to capture so famous and\\r\\n      precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the\\r\\n      appalling beauty of the vast milky mass, that lit up by a horizontal\\r\\n      spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue\\r\\n      morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of\\r\\n      these events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted.\\r\\n      The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was\\r\\n      his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in the\\r\\n      prow, and haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover,\\r\\n      when the four boats were lowered, the mate&rsquo;s got the start; and none\\r\\n      howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at\\r\\n      his oar. After a stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in\\r\\n      hand, Radney sprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in\\r\\n      a boat. And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale&rsquo;s topmost\\r\\n      back. Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding\\r\\n      foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck\\r\\n      as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing\\r\\n      mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale&rsquo;s slippery back, the boat\\r\\n      righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over\\r\\n      into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck out through the\\r\\n      spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly\\r\\n      seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But the whale rushed\\r\\n      round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws; and\\r\\n      rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Meantime, at the first tap of the boat&rsquo;s bottom, the Lakeman had\\r\\n      slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly\\r\\n      looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific, downward\\r\\n      jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He cut it; and\\r\\n      the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose again, with some\\r\\n      tatters of Radney&rsquo;s red woollen shirt, caught in the teeth that had\\r\\n      destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the whale eluded them,\\r\\n      and finally wholly disappeared.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port&mdash;a savage, solitary place&mdash;where\\r\\n      no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the Lakeman, all but five\\r\\n      or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms;\\r\\n      eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double war-canoe of the\\r\\n      savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The ship&rsquo;s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called\\r\\n      upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down\\r\\n      the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over their\\r\\n      dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both by night\\r\\n      and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent, that upon the\\r\\n      vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a weakened condition\\r\\n      that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel. After\\r\\n      taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the ship as far off shore as\\r\\n      possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his\\r\\n      muskets on the poop; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at\\r\\n      their peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best\\r\\n      whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred\\r\\n      miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which seemed\\r\\n      to have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from it; but the\\r\\n      savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him\\r\\n      to heave to, or he would run him under water. The captain presented a\\r\\n      pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman\\r\\n      laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked\\r\\n      in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and foam.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;What do you want of me?&rsquo; cried the captain.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?&rsquo; demanded Steelkilt;\\r\\n      &lsquo;no lies.&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am bound to Tahiti for more men.&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Very good. Let me board you a moment&mdash;I come in peace.&rsquo; With that\\r\\n      he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,\\r\\n      stood face to face with the captain.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As\\r\\n      soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder island,\\r\\n      and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike me!&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;A pretty scholar,&rsquo; laughed the Lakeman. &lsquo;Adios, Senor!&rsquo; and leaping into\\r\\n      the sea, he swam back to his comrades.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the roots\\r\\n      of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due time arrived\\r\\n      at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck befriended him; two\\r\\n      ships were about to sail for France, and were providentially in want of\\r\\n      precisely that number of men which the sailor headed. They embarked; and\\r\\n      so for ever got the start of their former captain, had he been at all\\r\\n      minded to work them legal retribution.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived, and\\r\\n      the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians, who\\r\\n      had been somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small native schooner, he\\r\\n      returned with them to his vessel; and finding all right there, again\\r\\n      resumed his cruisings.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of\\r\\n      Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to\\r\\n      give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that\\r\\n      destroyed him.  * * * *\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Are you through?&rsquo; said Don Sebastian, quietly.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am, Don.&rsquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions, this\\r\\n      your story is in substance really true?

Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas, something\\r\\n      like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the\\r\\n      whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the\\r\\n      whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there. It may be worth\\r\\n      while, therefore, previously to advert to those curious imaginary\\r\\n      portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge\\r\\n      the faith of the landsman. It is time to set the world right in this\\r\\n      matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be\\r\\n      found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For ever\\r\\n      since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings\\r\\n      of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields, medallions, cups,\\r\\n      and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of chain-armor like Saladin&rsquo;s,\\r\\n      and a helmeted head like St. George&rsquo;s; ever since then has something of\\r\\n      the same sort of license prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of\\r\\n      the whale, but in many scientific presentations of him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to\\r\\n      be the whale&rsquo;s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of Elephanta,\\r\\n      in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of\\r\\n      that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable\\r\\n      avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of them actually came\\r\\n      into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our noble profession of\\r\\n      whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The Hindoo whale referred\\r\\n      to, occurs in a separate department of the wall, depicting the incarnation\\r\\n      of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar.\\r\\n      But though this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give\\r\\n      the tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong. It\\r\\n      looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad palms of\\r\\n      the true whale&rsquo;s majestic flukes.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian painter&rsquo;s\\r\\n      portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian\\r\\n      Hindoo. It is Guido&rsquo;s picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the\\r\\n      sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model of such a strange\\r\\n      creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the same scene in his own\\r\\n      &ldquo;Perseus Descending,&rdquo; make out one whit better. The huge corpulence of\\r\\n      that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one\\r\\n      inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended\\r\\n      tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling, might be taken for the\\r\\n      Traitors&rsquo; Gate leading from the Thames by water into the Tower. Then,\\r\\n      there are the Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah&rsquo;s whale,\\r\\n      as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers. What\\r\\n      shall be said of these? As for the book-binder&rsquo;s whale winding like a\\r\\n      vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor&mdash;as stamped and\\r\\n      gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and new&mdash;that\\r\\n      is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature, imitated, I take it,\\r\\n      from the like figures on antique vases. Though universally denominated a\\r\\n      dolphin, I nevertheless call this book-binder&rsquo;s fish an attempt at a\\r\\n      whale; because it was so intended when the device was first introduced. It\\r\\n      was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th\\r\\n      century, during the Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down\\r\\n      to a comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a\\r\\n      species of the Leviathan.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will\\r\\n      at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all manner of\\r\\n      spouts, jets d&rsquo;eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and Baden-Baden, come\\r\\n      bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the title-page of the original\\r\\n      edition of the &ldquo;Advancement of Learning&rdquo; you will find some curious\\r\\n      whales.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those\\r\\n      pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations, by\\r\\n      those who know. In old Harris&rsquo;s collection of voyages there are some\\r\\n      plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671,\\r\\n      entitled &ldquo;A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the Whale,\\r\\n      Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.&rdquo; In one of those plates the whales,\\r\\n      like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among ice-isles, with\\r\\n      white bears running over their living backs. In another plate, the\\r\\n      prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular\\r\\n      flukes.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain Colnett, a\\r\\n      Post Captain in the English navy, entitled &ldquo;A Voyage round Cape Horn into\\r\\n      the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale\\r\\n      Fisheries.&rdquo; In this book is an outline purporting to be a &ldquo;Picture of a\\r\\n      Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from one killed on the coast\\r\\n      of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.&rdquo; I doubt not the captain had\\r\\n      this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines. To mention\\r\\n      but one thing about it, let me say that it has an eye which applied,\\r\\n      according to the accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would\\r\\n      make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet long. Ah, my\\r\\n      gallant captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the\\r\\n      benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of\\r\\n      mistake. Look at that popular work &ldquo;Goldsmith&rsquo;s Animated Nature.&rdquo; In the\\r\\n      abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged &ldquo;whale&rdquo;\\r\\n       and a &ldquo;narwhale.&rdquo; I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this unsightly\\r\\n      whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the narwhale, one\\r\\n      glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this nineteenth century such\\r\\n      a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of\\r\\n      schoolboys.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de LacÃ©pÃ¨de, a great\\r\\n      naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are\\r\\n      several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these are\\r\\n      not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale\\r\\n      (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long experienced man\\r\\n      as touching that species, declares not to have its counterpart in nature.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was\\r\\n      reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous Baron.\\r\\n      In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he gives what\\r\\n      he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that picture to any\\r\\n      Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket.\\r\\n      In a word, Frederick Cuvier&rsquo;s Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a\\r\\n      squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men\\r\\n      seldom have), but whence he derived that picture, who can tell? Perhaps he\\r\\n      got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one\\r\\n      of his authentic abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort\\r\\n      of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and\\r\\n      saucers inform us.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As for the sign-painters&rsquo; whales seen in the streets hanging over the\\r\\n      shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally\\r\\n      Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage; breakfasting\\r\\n      on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of mariners: their\\r\\n      deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very\\r\\n      surprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have been\\r\\n      taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a drawing\\r\\n      of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent the noble\\r\\n      animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars. Though\\r\\n      elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living Leviathan has\\r\\n      never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The living whale, in\\r\\n      his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in\\r\\n      unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like\\r\\n      a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing\\r\\n      eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so\\r\\n      as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations. And, not to speak of\\r\\n      the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale\\r\\n      and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of one of\\r\\n      those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship&rsquo;s deck, such is then the\\r\\n      outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that his precise\\r\\n      expression the devil himself could not catch.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale,\\r\\n      accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all. For it\\r\\n      is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan, that his skeleton\\r\\n      gives very little idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy Bentham&rsquo;s\\r\\n      skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his\\r\\n      executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old\\r\\n      gentleman, with all Jeremy&rsquo;s other leading personal characteristics; yet\\r\\n      nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan&rsquo;s articulated\\r\\n      bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale\\r\\n      bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the\\r\\n      insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it. This\\r\\n      peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this\\r\\n      book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously displayed in\\r\\n      the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the\\r\\n      human hand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers,\\r\\n      the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But all these are permanently\\r\\n      lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human fingers in an artificial\\r\\n      covering. &ldquo;However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,&rdquo; said\\r\\n      humorous Stubb one day, &ldquo;he can never be truly said to handle us without\\r\\n      mittens.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs\\r\\n      conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which\\r\\n      must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the mark\\r\\n      much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very considerable\\r\\n      degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely\\r\\n      what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in which you can\\r\\n      derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by going a whaling\\r\\n      yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of being eternally stove\\r\\n      and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too\\r\\n      fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0056\" id=\"link2HCH0056\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 56. Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True Pictures of Whaling Scenes.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly tempted\\r\\n      here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to\\r\\n      be found in certain books, both ancient and modern, especially in Pliny,\\r\\n      Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass that matter by.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;\\r\\n      Colnett&rsquo;s, Huggins&rsquo;s, Frederick Cuvier&rsquo;s, and Beale&rsquo;s. In the previous\\r\\n      chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins&rsquo;s is far better\\r\\n      than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale&rsquo;s is the best. All Beale&rsquo;s drawings\\r\\n      of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in the picture of\\r\\n      three whales in various attitudes, capping his second chapter. His\\r\\n      frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no doubt calculated to\\r\\n      excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is admirably correct and\\r\\n      life-like in its general effect. Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J.\\r\\n      Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour; but they are wretchedly\\r\\n      engraved. That is not his fault though.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they\\r\\n      are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has\\r\\n      but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency, because\\r\\n      it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you can derive\\r\\n      anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living\\r\\n      hunters.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details not\\r\\n      the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be\\r\\n      anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed, and taken\\r\\n      from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent attacks on the\\r\\n      Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is\\r\\n      depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath the boat from the\\r\\n      profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the air upon his back the\\r\\n      terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of the boat is partially\\r\\n      unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the monster&rsquo;s spine; and\\r\\n      standing in that prow, for that one single incomputable flash of time, you\\r\\n      behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the\\r\\n      whale, and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice. The action of\\r\\n      the whole thing is wonderfully good and true. The half-emptied line-tub\\r\\n      floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons\\r\\n      obliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about\\r\\n      the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the black\\r\\n      stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene. Serious fault\\r\\n      might be found with the anatomical details of this whale, but let that\\r\\n      pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw so good a one.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the\\r\\n      barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black weedy\\r\\n      bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian cliffs. His\\r\\n      jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so that from so abounding a\\r\\n      smoke in the chimney, you would think there must be a brave supper cooking\\r\\n      in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs,\\r\\n      shell-fish, and other sea candies and maccaroni, which the Right Whale\\r\\n      sometimes carries on his pestilent back. And all the while the\\r\\n      thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of\\r\\n      tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock in\\r\\n      the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer.\\r\\n      Thus, the foreground is all raging commotion; but behind, in admirable\\r\\n      artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping\\r\\n      unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead\\r\\n      whale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from\\r\\n      the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he was\\r\\n      either practically conversant with his subject, or else marvellously\\r\\n      tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the lads for painting\\r\\n      action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe, and where will you\\r\\n      find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas, as in\\r\\n      that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the beholder fights his way,\\r\\n      pell-mell, through the consecutive great battles of France; where every\\r\\n      sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights, and the successive armed kings\\r\\n      and Emperors dash by, like a charge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly\\r\\n      unworthy of a place in that gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of\\r\\n      Garnery.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of\\r\\n      things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings\\r\\n      they have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England&rsquo;s\\r\\n      experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the\\r\\n      Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only\\r\\n      finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale\\r\\n      hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale draughtsmen seem\\r\\n      entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things, such as\\r\\n      the vacant profile of the whale; which, so far as picturesqueness of\\r\\n      effect is concerned, is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a\\r\\n      pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned Right whaleman, after giving\\r\\n      us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale, and three or four delicate\\r\\n      miniatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats us to a series of classical\\r\\n      engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels; and with the\\r\\n      microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a\\r\\n      shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals.\\r\\n      I mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager (I honor him for a\\r\\n      veteran), but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not\\r\\n      to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a\\r\\n      Greenland Justice of the Peace.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other\\r\\n      French engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself &ldquo;H.\\r\\n      Durand.&rdquo; One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present purpose,\\r\\n      nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet noon-scene\\r\\n      among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored, inshore, in a\\r\\n      calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened sails of the ship,\\r\\n      and the long leaves of the palms in the background, both drooping together\\r\\n      in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine, when considered with\\r\\n      reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few\\r\\n      aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving is quite a different\\r\\n      affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of the\\r\\n      Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the act of\\r\\n      cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and a boat,\\r\\n      hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is about giving chase\\r\\n      to whales in the distance. The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use;\\r\\n      three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole; while from a sudden\\r\\n      roll of the sea, the little craft stands half-erect out of the water, like\\r\\n      a rearing horse. From the ship, the smoke of the torments of the boiling\\r\\n      whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies; and to\\r\\n      windward, a black cloud, rising up with earnest of squalls and rains,\\r\\n      seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0057\" id=\"link2HCH0057\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 57. Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in Stone; in Mountains; in Stars.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a\\r\\n      crippled beggar (or <i>kedger</i>, as the sailors say) holding a painted board\\r\\n      before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg. There\\r\\n      are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats (presumed to\\r\\n      contain the missing leg in all its original integrity) is being crunched\\r\\n      by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any time these ten years, they tell me,\\r\\n      has that man held up that picture, and exhibited that stump to an\\r\\n      incredulous world. But the time of his justification has now come. His\\r\\n      three whales are as good whales as were ever published in Wapping, at any\\r\\n      rate; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the\\r\\n      western clearings. But, though for ever mounted on that stump, never a\\r\\n      stump-speech does the poor whaleman make; but, with downcast eyes, stands\\r\\n      ruefully contemplating his own amputation.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and Sag\\r\\n      Harbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling-scenes,\\r\\n      graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale-teeth, or ladies&rsquo; busks\\r\\n      wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and other like skrimshander articles,\\r\\n      as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they\\r\\n      elaborately carve out of the rough material, in their hours of ocean\\r\\n      leisure. Some of them have little boxes of dentistical-looking implements,\\r\\n      specially intended for the skrimshandering business. But, in general, they\\r\\n      toil with their jack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool\\r\\n      of the sailor, they will turn you out anything you please, in the way of a\\r\\n      mariner&rsquo;s fancy.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to\\r\\n      that condition in which God placed him, <i>i.e.</i> what is called savagery. Your\\r\\n      true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I myself am a\\r\\n      savage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals; and ready\\r\\n      at any moment to rebel against him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic\\r\\n      hours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian war-club\\r\\n      or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving, is\\r\\n      as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon. For, with but\\r\\n      a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark&rsquo;s tooth, that miraculous intricacy of\\r\\n      wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has cost steady years of steady\\r\\n      application.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the\\r\\n      same marvellous patience, and with the same single shark&rsquo;s tooth, of his\\r\\n      one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not quite\\r\\n      as workmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of design, as the\\r\\n      Greek savage, Achilles&rsquo;s shield; and full of barbaric spirit and\\r\\n      suggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert Durer.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Wooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the\\r\\n      noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the forecastles of\\r\\n      American whalers. Some of them are done with much accuracy.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by\\r\\n      the tail for knockers to the road-side door. When the porter is sleepy,\\r\\n      the anvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking whales are seldom\\r\\n      remarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some old-fashioned\\r\\n      churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for weather-cocks;\\r\\n      but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all intents and purposes\\r\\n      so labelled with &ldquo;<i>Hands off!</i>&rdquo; you cannot examine them closely enough to\\r\\n      decide upon their merit.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken\\r\\n      cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain,\\r\\n      you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan\\r\\n      partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf\\r\\n      of green surges.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually\\r\\n      girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from some lucky point\\r\\n      of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined\\r\\n      along the undulating ridges. But you must be a thorough whaleman, to see\\r\\n      these sights; and not only that, but if you wish to return to such a sight\\r\\n      again, you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and\\r\\n      longitude of your first stand-point, else so chance-like are such\\r\\n      observations of the hills, that your precise, previous stand-point would\\r\\n      require a laborious re-discovery; like the Soloma Islands, which still\\r\\n      remain incognita, though once high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old\\r\\n      Figuera chronicled them.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out\\r\\n      great whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them; as when\\r\\n      long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in\\r\\n      battle among the clouds. Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round\\r\\n      and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first\\r\\n      defined him to me. And beneath the effulgent Antarctic skies I have\\r\\n      boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase against the starry Cetus far\\r\\n      beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the Flying Fish.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      With a frigate&rsquo;s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for\\r\\n      spurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to see\\r\\n      whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie\\r\\n      encamped beyond my mortal sight!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0058\" id=\"link2HCH0058\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 58. Brit.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows of\\r\\n      brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale largely\\r\\n      feeds. For leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that we seemed to\\r\\n      be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from the\\r\\n      attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly swam\\r\\n      through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous\\r\\n      Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated from the\\r\\n      water that escaped at the lip.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their\\r\\n      scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these monsters\\r\\n      swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving behind them\\r\\n      endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.*\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      *That part of the sea known among whalemen as the &ldquo;Brazil Banks&rdquo; does not\\r\\n      bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there being\\r\\n      shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable meadow-like\\r\\n      appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in\\r\\n      those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all\\r\\n      reminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads, especially when they\\r\\n      paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms looked more\\r\\n      like lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in the great\\r\\n      hunting countries of India, the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass\\r\\n      on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such, taking\\r\\n      them for bare, blackened elevations of the soil; even so, often, with him,\\r\\n      who for the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea.\\r\\n      And even when recognised at last, their immense magnitude renders it very\\r\\n      hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly\\r\\n      be instinct, in all parts, with the same sort of life that lives in a dog\\r\\n      or a horse.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep\\r\\n      with the same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though some old\\r\\n      naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their\\r\\n      kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the thing, this\\r\\n      may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for example, does the\\r\\n      ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious\\r\\n      kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect\\r\\n      be said to bear comparative analogy to him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas\\r\\n      have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling;\\r\\n      though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita, so that\\r\\n      Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one\\r\\n      superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the most terrific of all\\r\\n      mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and\\r\\n      hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters; though but a\\r\\n      moment&rsquo;s consideration will teach, that however baby man may brag of his\\r\\n      science and skill, and however much, in a flattering future, that science\\r\\n      and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever, to the crack of doom,\\r\\n      the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize the stateliest, stiffest\\r\\n      frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the continual repetition of these\\r\\n      very impressions, man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea\\r\\n      which aboriginally belongs to it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese\\r\\n      vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow.\\r\\n      That same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of\\r\\n      last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah&rsquo;s flood is not yet subsided; two\\r\\n      thirds of the fair world it yet covers.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a\\r\\n      miracle upon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews,\\r\\n      when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and\\r\\n      swallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in\\r\\n      precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it is\\r\\n      also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who\\r\\n      murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath\\r\\n      spawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own\\r\\n      cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks, and\\r\\n      leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships. No mercy,\\r\\n      no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting like a mad battle\\r\\n      steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean overruns the globe.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide\\r\\n      under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden\\r\\n      beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish\\r\\n      brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the\\r\\n      dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once more,\\r\\n      the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each\\r\\n      other, carrying on eternal war since the world began.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile\\r\\n      earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a\\r\\n      strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean\\r\\n      surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular\\r\\n      Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the\\r\\n      half known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that isle, thou canst\\r\\n      never return!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0059\" id=\"link2HCH0059\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 59. Squid.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on her\\r\\n      way north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air impelling her\\r\\n      keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts\\r\\n      mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three mild palms on a plain. And\\r\\n      still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely, alluring jet\\r\\n      would be seen.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural\\r\\n      spread over the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm; when the\\r\\n      long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across\\r\\n      them, enjoining some secrecy; when the slippered waves whispered together\\r\\n      as they softly ran on; in this profound hush of the visible sphere a\\r\\n      strange spectre was seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and\\r\\n      higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed before\\r\\n      our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus glistening for a\\r\\n      moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once more arose, and\\r\\n      silently gleamed. It seemed not a whale; and yet is this Moby Dick?\\r\\n      thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing once\\r\\n      more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod, the\\r\\n      negro yelled out&mdash;&ldquo;There! there again! there she breaches! right\\r\\n      ahead! The White Whale, the White Whale!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the\\r\\n      bees rush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on the\\r\\n      bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his\\r\\n      orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction indicated\\r\\n      aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had\\r\\n      gradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the\\r\\n      ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale\\r\\n      he pursued; however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed him;\\r\\n      whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly perceive the\\r\\n      white mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for\\r\\n      lowering.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The four boats were soon on the water; Ahab&rsquo;s in advance, and all swiftly\\r\\n      pulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and while, with oars\\r\\n      suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same spot where\\r\\n      it sank, once more it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for the moment all\\r\\n      thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which\\r\\n      the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind. A vast pulpy mass,\\r\\n      furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing cream-colour, lay floating\\r\\n      on the water, innumerable long arms radiating from its centre, and curling\\r\\n      and twisting like a nest of anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any\\r\\n      hapless object within reach. No perceptible face or front did it have; no\\r\\n      conceivable token of either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on\\r\\n      the billows, an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still\\r\\n      gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice\\r\\n      exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than\\r\\n      to have seen thee, thou white ghost!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What was it, Sir?&rdquo; said Flask.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld, and\\r\\n      returned to their ports to tell of it.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel; the\\r\\n      rest as silently following.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with\\r\\n      the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it being so\\r\\n      very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with\\r\\n      portentousness. So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them\\r\\n      declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few of\\r\\n      them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and\\r\\n      form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his\\r\\n      only food. For though other species of whales find their food above water,\\r\\n      and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the spermaceti whale obtains\\r\\n      his whole food in unknown zones below the surface; and only by inference\\r\\n      is it that any one can tell of what, precisely, that food consists. At\\r\\n      times, when closely pursued, he will disgorge what are supposed to be the\\r\\n      detached arms of the squid; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty\\r\\n      and thirty feet in length. They fancy that the monster to which these arms\\r\\n      belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean; and that the\\r\\n      sperm whale, unlike other species, is supplied with teeth in order to\\r\\n      attack and tear it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop\\r\\n      Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in which\\r\\n      the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with some\\r\\n      other particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond. But much\\r\\n      abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious\\r\\n      creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of cuttle-fish,\\r\\n      to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would seem to belong,\\r\\n      but only as the Anak of the tribe.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0060\" id=\"link2HCH0060\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 60. The Line.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as\\r\\n      for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented, I\\r\\n      have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly\\r\\n      vapored with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary\\r\\n      ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable to\\r\\n      the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the\\r\\n      sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary quantity too\\r\\n      much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must be\\r\\n      subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general by no\\r\\n      means adds to the rope&rsquo;s durability or strength, however much it may give\\r\\n      it compactness and gloss.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely\\r\\n      superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not so durable\\r\\n      as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and I will add\\r\\n      (since there is an Ã¦sthetics in all things), is much more handsome and\\r\\n      becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark fellow, a sort of\\r\\n      Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian to behold.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first sight,\\r\\n      you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment its one\\r\\n      and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty\\r\\n      pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three\\r\\n      tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures something over two\\r\\n      hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away\\r\\n      in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form\\r\\n      one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded &ldquo;sheaves,&rdquo; or layers of\\r\\n      concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the &ldquo;heart,&rdquo; or minute\\r\\n      vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese. As the least tangle or\\r\\n      kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take somebody&rsquo;s arm,\\r\\n      leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line\\r\\n      in its tub. Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this\\r\\n      business, carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards\\r\\n      through a block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it\\r\\n      from all possible wrinkles and twists.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line being\\r\\n      continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in this; because\\r\\n      these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat, and do\\r\\n      not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub, nearly three feet in\\r\\n      diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky freight for a\\r\\n      craft whose planks are but one half-inch in thickness; for the bottom of\\r\\n      the whale-boat is like critical ice, which will bear up a considerable\\r\\n      distributed weight, but not very much of a concentrated one. When the\\r\\n      painted canvas cover is clapped on the American line-tub, the boat looks\\r\\n      as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding-cake to present\\r\\n      to the whales.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an\\r\\n      eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub,\\r\\n      and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything. This\\r\\n      arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First: In order\\r\\n      to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring\\r\\n      boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to\\r\\n      carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon. In these\\r\\n      instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale, as it were,\\r\\n      from the one boat to the other; though the first boat always hovers at\\r\\n      hand to assist its consort. Second: This arrangement is indispensable for\\r\\n      common safety&rsquo;s sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way\\r\\n      attached to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the\\r\\n      end almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not\\r\\n      stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him\\r\\n      into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever\\r\\n      find her again.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is taken\\r\\n      aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is again carried\\r\\n      forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon the loom or\\r\\n      handle of every man&rsquo;s oar, so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing;\\r\\n      and also passing between the men, as they alternately sit at the opposite\\r\\n      gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of\\r\\n      the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill,\\r\\n      prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it hangs in a slight\\r\\n      festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat again; and some\\r\\n      ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being coiled upon the box in the\\r\\n      bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and\\r\\n      is then attached to the short-warp&mdash;the rope which is immediately\\r\\n      connected with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the short-warp\\r\\n      goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,\\r\\n      twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. All the oarsmen\\r\\n      are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid eye of the\\r\\n      landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest snakes\\r\\n      sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal woman, for\\r\\n      the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies, and while\\r\\n      straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any unknown instant\\r\\n      the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible contortions be put in\\r\\n      play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus circumstanced without a\\r\\n      shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a\\r\\n      shaken jelly. Yet habit&mdash;strange thing! what cannot habit accomplish?&mdash;Gayer\\r\\n      sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never\\r\\n      heard over your mahogany, than you will hear over the half-inch white\\r\\n      cedar of the whale-boat, when thus hung in hangman&rsquo;s nooses; and, like the\\r\\n      six burghers of Calais before King Edward, the six men composing the crew\\r\\n      pull into the jaws of death, with a halter around every neck, as you may\\r\\n      say.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those\\r\\n      repeated whaling disasters&mdash;some few of which are casually chronicled&mdash;of\\r\\n      this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost.\\r\\n      For, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is like\\r\\n      being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam-engine in\\r\\n      full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and wheel, is grazing you.\\r\\n      It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils,\\r\\n      because the boat is rocking like a cradle, and you are pitched one way and\\r\\n      the other, without the slightest warning; and only by a certain\\r\\n      self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action, can\\r\\n      you escape being made a Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing\\r\\n      sun himself could never pierce you out.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies\\r\\n      of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself; for, indeed,\\r\\n      the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and contains it in\\r\\n      itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder, and the\\r\\n      ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the line, as it\\r\\n      silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual\\r\\n      play&mdash;this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any\\r\\n      other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men live\\r\\n      enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but\\r\\n      it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals\\r\\n      realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life. And if you be a\\r\\n      philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel\\r\\n      one whit more of terror, than though seated before your evening fire with\\r\\n      a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0061\" id=\"link2HCH0061\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 61. Stubb Kills a Whale.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to\\r\\n      Queequeg it was quite a different object.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;When you see him &rsquo;quid,&rdquo; said the savage, honing his harpoon in the bow\\r\\n      of his hoisted boat, &ldquo;then you quick see him &rsquo;parm whale.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special to\\r\\n      engage them, the Pequod&rsquo;s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep\\r\\n      induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean through\\r\\n      which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground;\\r\\n      that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish,\\r\\n      and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than those off the\\r\\n      Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders\\r\\n      leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed in\\r\\n      what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in that\\r\\n      dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of my body;\\r\\n      though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will, long after the\\r\\n      power which first moved it is withdrawn.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the seamen\\r\\n      at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. So that at last all\\r\\n      three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every swing that we\\r\\n      made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman. The waves,\\r\\n      too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the wide trance of the sea,\\r\\n      east nodded to west, and the sun over all.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my\\r\\n      hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved me;\\r\\n      with a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not forty\\r\\n      fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the\\r\\n      capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian hue,\\r\\n      glistening in the sun&rsquo;s rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating in the\\r\\n      trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet,\\r\\n      the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm\\r\\n      afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck by some\\r\\n      enchanter&rsquo;s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once\\r\\n      started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts\\r\\n      of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted\\r\\n      forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted\\r\\n      the sparkling brine into the air.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Clear away the boats! Luff!&rdquo; cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he\\r\\n      dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and ere\\r\\n      the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the leeward,\\r\\n      but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples as he swam,\\r\\n      that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab gave orders\\r\\n      that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak but in whispers. So\\r\\n      seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats, we swiftly but\\r\\n      silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails\\r\\n      being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase, the monster\\r\\n      perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air, and then sank\\r\\n      out of sight like a tower swallowed up.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;There go flukes!&rdquo; was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by\\r\\n      Stubb&rsquo;s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite was\\r\\n      granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the whale\\r\\n      rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker&rsquo;s boat, and much nearer\\r\\n      to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the honor of the\\r\\n      capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length become aware of\\r\\n      his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use.\\r\\n      Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play. And still puffing at\\r\\n      his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the assault.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy, he\\r\\n      was going &ldquo;head out&rdquo;; that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast\\r\\n      which he brewed.*\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      *It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the\\r\\n      entire interior of the sperm whale&rsquo;s enormous head consists. Though\\r\\n      apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about him.\\r\\n      So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does so when\\r\\n      going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the upper part\\r\\n      of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water formation of the\\r\\n      lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he thereby may be said\\r\\n      to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a\\r\\n      sharppointed New York pilot-boat.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Start her, start her, my men! Don&rsquo;t hurry yourselves; take plenty of time&mdash;but\\r\\n      start her; start her like thunder-claps, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; cried Stubb,\\r\\n      spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. &ldquo;Start her, now; give &rsquo;em the long\\r\\n      and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy&mdash;start her, all;\\r\\n      but keep cool, keep cool&mdash;cucumbers is the word&mdash;easy, easy&mdash;only\\r\\n      start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the buried dead\\r\\n      perpendicular out of their graves, boys&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. Start her!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!&rdquo; screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old\\r\\n      war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat\\r\\n      involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which\\r\\n      the eager Indian gave.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. &ldquo;Kee-hee!\\r\\n      Kee-hee!&rdquo; yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat,\\r\\n      like a pacing tiger in his cage.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Ka-la! Koo-loo!&rdquo; howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a mouthful\\r\\n      of Grenadier&rsquo;s steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea.\\r\\n      Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still encouraged his men\\r\\n      to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth. Like\\r\\n      desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the welcome cry was heard&mdash;&ldquo;Stand\\r\\n      up, Tashtego!&mdash;give it to him!&rdquo; The harpoon was hurled. &ldquo;Stern all!&rdquo;\\r\\n       The oarsmen backed water; the same moment something went hot and hissing\\r\\n      along every one of their wrists. It was the magical line. An instant\\r\\n      before, Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the\\r\\n      loggerhead, whence, by reason of its increased rapid circlings, a hempen\\r\\n      blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe.\\r\\n      As the line passed round and round the loggerhead; so also, just before\\r\\n      reaching that point, it blisteringly passed through and through both of\\r\\n      Stubb&rsquo;s hands, from which the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas\\r\\n      sometimes worn at these times, had accidentally dropped. It was like\\r\\n      holding an enemy&rsquo;s sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all\\r\\n      the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Wet the line! wet the line!&rdquo; cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him seated\\r\\n      by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into it.* More\\r\\n      turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place. The boat now\\r\\n      flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins. Stubb and Tashtego\\r\\n      here changed places&mdash;stem for stern&mdash;a staggering business truly\\r\\n      in that rocking commotion.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      *Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be stated,\\r\\n      that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the running line\\r\\n      with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or bailer, is set apart\\r\\n      for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most convenient.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of\\r\\n      the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you would\\r\\n      have thought the craft had two keels&mdash;one cleaving the water, the\\r\\n      other the air&mdash;as the boat churned on through both opposing elements\\r\\n      at once. A continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy\\r\\n      in her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a\\r\\n      little finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic\\r\\n      gunwale into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main\\r\\n      clinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall\\r\\n      form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order to\\r\\n      bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed\\r\\n      passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat\\r\\n      slackened his flight.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Haul in&mdash;haul in!&rdquo; cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round\\r\\n      towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while yet\\r\\n      the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly\\r\\n      planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart into the\\r\\n      flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately sterning out of\\r\\n      the way of the whale&rsquo;s horrible wallow, and then ranging up for another\\r\\n      fling.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a\\r\\n      hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which bubbled\\r\\n      and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun playing\\r\\n      upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection into every\\r\\n      face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men. And all the\\r\\n      while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle\\r\\n      of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited\\r\\n      headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his crooked lance (by the line\\r\\n      attached to it), Stubb straightened it again and again, by a few rapid\\r\\n      blows against the gunwale, then again and again sent it into the whale.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Pull up&mdash;pull up!&rdquo; he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale\\r\\n      relaxed in his wrath. &ldquo;Pull up!&mdash;close to!&rdquo; and the boat ranged along\\r\\n      the fish&rsquo;s flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned his\\r\\n      long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully churning and\\r\\n      churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the\\r\\n      whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of breaking ere he\\r\\n      could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of\\r\\n      the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting from his trance into that\\r\\n      unspeakable thing called his &ldquo;flurry,&rdquo; the monster horribly wallowed in\\r\\n      his blood, overwrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so\\r\\n      that the imperilled craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly\\r\\n      to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the\\r\\n      day.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into view;\\r\\n      surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting his\\r\\n      spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last, gush\\r\\n      after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees of red\\r\\n      wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran dripping\\r\\n      down his motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead, Mr. Stubb,&rdquo; said Daggoo.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Yes; both pipes smoked out!&rdquo; and withdrawing his own from his mouth,\\r\\n      Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood\\r\\n      thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0062\" id=\"link2HCH0062\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 62. The Dart.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      A word concerning an incident in the last chapter.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes\\r\\n      off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary\\r\\n      steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost oar,\\r\\n      the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong, nervous arm to\\r\\n      strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what is called a long\\r\\n      dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or\\r\\n      thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting the chase, the\\r\\n      harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost; indeed,\\r\\n      he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not\\r\\n      only by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations;\\r\\n      and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one&rsquo;s compass, while all the\\r\\n      other muscles are strained and half started&mdash;what that is none know\\r\\n      but those who have tried it. For one, I cannot bawl very heartily and work\\r\\n      very recklessly at one and the same time. In this straining, bawling\\r\\n      state, then, with his back to the fish, all at once the exhausted\\r\\n      harpooneer hears the exciting cry&mdash;&ldquo;Stand up, and give it to him!&rdquo; He\\r\\n      now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round on his centre half way,\\r\\n      seize his harpoon from the crotch, and with what little strength may\\r\\n      remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale. No wonder, taking\\r\\n      the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that out of fifty fair chances for\\r\\n      a dart, not five are successful; no wonder that so many hapless\\r\\n      harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated; no wonder that some of them\\r\\n      actually burst their blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm\\r\\n      whalemen are absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many\\r\\n      ship owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer\\r\\n      that makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can\\r\\n      you expect to find it there when most wanted!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,\\r\\n      that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer\\r\\n      likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of\\r\\n      themselves and every one else. It is then they change places; and the\\r\\n      headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper station\\r\\n      in the bows of the boat.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both foolish\\r\\n      and unnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from first to last;\\r\\n      he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no rowing whatever\\r\\n      should be expected of him, except under circumstances obvious to any\\r\\n      fisherman. I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed\\r\\n      in the chase; but long experience in various whalemen of more than one\\r\\n      nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the\\r\\n      fishery, it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as\\r\\n      the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this\\r\\n      world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out of\\r\\n      toil.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0063\" id=\"link2HCH0063\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 63.

It\\r\\n      is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length, which is\\r\\n      perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow, for the\\r\\n      purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon,\\r\\n      whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the prow. Thereby\\r\\n      the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it up as\\r\\n      readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall. It\\r\\n      is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively\\r\\n      called the first and second irons.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with the\\r\\n      line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one instantly\\r\\n      after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the coming drag, one\\r\\n      should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It is a doubling of\\r\\n      the chances. But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous,\\r\\n      violent, convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron, it\\r\\n      becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however lightning-like in his\\r\\n      movements, to pitch the second iron into him. Nevertheless, as the second\\r\\n      iron is already connected with the line, and the line is running, hence\\r\\n      that weapon must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat,\\r\\n      somehow and somewhere; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all\\r\\n      hands. Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare\\r\\n      coils of box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in\\r\\n      most instances, prudently practicable. But this critical act is not always\\r\\n      unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard,\\r\\n      it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror, skittishly\\r\\n      curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the lines, or cutting\\r\\n      them, and making a prodigious sensation in all directions. Nor, in\\r\\n      general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly\\r\\n      captured and a corpse.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one\\r\\n      unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these qualities\\r\\n      in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an\\r\\n      audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be\\r\\n      simultaneously dangling about him. For, of course, each boat is supplied\\r\\n      with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be\\r\\n      ineffectually darted without recovery. All these particulars are\\r\\n      faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to elucidate several most\\r\\n      important, however intricate passages, in scenes hereafter to be painted.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0064\" id=\"link2HCH0064\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 64. Stubb&rsquo;s Supper.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Stubb&rsquo;s whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was a calm;\\r\\n      so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow business of\\r\\n      towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen men with our\\r\\n      thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers, slowly\\r\\n      toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse in the sea; and it\\r\\n      seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long intervals; good evidence was\\r\\n      hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved. For, upon the\\r\\n      great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever they call it, in China, four or five\\r\\n      laborers on the foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of\\r\\n      a mile an hour; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if\\r\\n      laden with pig-lead in bulk.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod&rsquo;s\\r\\n      main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab\\r\\n      dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing\\r\\n      the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for securing it\\r\\n      for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman, went his way into\\r\\n      the cabin, and did not come forward again until morning.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had evinced\\r\\n      his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the creature was dead,\\r\\n      some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or despair, seemed working in\\r\\n      him; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet\\r\\n      to be slain; and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship,\\r\\n      all that would not one jot advance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon\\r\\n      you would have thought from the sound on the Pequod&rsquo;s decks, that all\\r\\n      hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are\\r\\n      being dragged along the deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes.\\r\\n      But by those clanking links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to\\r\\n      be moored. Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the\\r\\n      whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel&rsquo;s and seen through\\r\\n      the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the\\r\\n      two&mdash;ship and whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks,\\r\\n      whereof one reclines while the other remains standing.*\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      *A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most\\r\\n      reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside, is\\r\\n      by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is\\r\\n      relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its\\r\\n      flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface; so\\r\\n      that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to put the\\r\\n      chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a small,\\r\\n      strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end, and a weight\\r\\n      in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship. By adroit\\r\\n      management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass,\\r\\n      so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow\\r\\n      suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the\\r\\n      smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad flukes\\r\\n      or lobes.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known on\\r\\n      deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an unusual\\r\\n      but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was he in that\\r\\n      the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned to him for the\\r\\n      time the sole management of affairs. One small, helping cause of all this\\r\\n      liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely manifest. Stubb was a high\\r\\n      liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish\\r\\n      thing to his palate.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut me\\r\\n      one from his small!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general\\r\\n      thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray\\r\\n      the current expenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds of\\r\\n      the voyage), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers who have\\r\\n      a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale designated by\\r\\n      Stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the body.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two lanterns\\r\\n      of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the\\r\\n      capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb the only\\r\\n      banqueter on whale&rsquo;s flesh that night. Mingling their mumblings with his\\r\\n      own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks, swarming round the\\r\\n      dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness. The few sleepers below\\r\\n      in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails\\r\\n      against the hull, within a few inches of the sleepers&rsquo; hearts. Peering\\r\\n      over the side you could just see them (as before you heard them) wallowing\\r\\n      in the sullen, black waters, and turning over on their backs as they\\r\\n      scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human\\r\\n      head. This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous. How at\\r\\n      such an apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such\\r\\n      symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all\\r\\n      things. The mark they thus leave on the whale, may best be likened to the\\r\\n      hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks\\r\\n      will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship&rsquo;s decks, like hungry dogs\\r\\n      round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every\\r\\n      killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant butchers\\r\\n      over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other&rsquo;s live meat\\r\\n      with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks, also, with their\\r\\n      jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the\\r\\n      dead meat; and though, were you to turn the whole affair upside down, it\\r\\n      would still be pretty much the same thing, that is to say, a shocking\\r\\n      sharkish business enough for all parties; and though sharks also are the\\r\\n      invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic,\\r\\n      systematically trotting alongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to be\\r\\n      carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be decently buried; and though one or\\r\\n      two other like instances might be set down, touching the set terms,\\r\\n      places, and occasions, when sharks do most socially congregate, and most\\r\\n      hilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you\\r\\n      will find them in such countless numbers, and in gayer or more jovial\\r\\n      spirits, than around a dead sperm whale, moored by night to a whaleship at\\r\\n      sea. If you have never seen that sight, then suspend your decision about\\r\\n      the propriety of devil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the\\r\\n      devil.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going\\r\\n      on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own\\r\\n      epicurean lips.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Cook, cook!&mdash;where&rsquo;s that old Fleece?&rdquo; he cried at length, widening\\r\\n      his legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his supper;\\r\\n      and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if stabbing with\\r\\n      his lance; &ldquo;cook, you cook!&mdash;sail this way, cook!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously roused\\r\\n      from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came shambling along\\r\\n      from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was something the matter\\r\\n      with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well scoured like his other\\r\\n      pans; this old Fleece, as they called him, came shuffling and limping\\r\\n      along, assisting his step with his tongs, which, after a clumsy fashion,\\r\\n      were made of straightened iron hoops; this old Ebony floundered along, and\\r\\n      in obedience to the word of command, came to a dead stop on the opposite\\r\\n      side of Stubb&rsquo;s sideboard; when, with both hands folded before him, and\\r\\n      resting on his two-legged cane, he bowed his arched back still further\\r\\n      over, at the same time sideways inclining his head, so as to bring his\\r\\n      best ear into play.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Cook,&rdquo; said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth,\\r\\n      &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think this steak is rather overdone? You&rsquo;ve been beating this\\r\\n      steak too much, cook; it&rsquo;s too tender. Don&rsquo;t I always say that to be good,\\r\\n      a whale-steak must be tough? There are those sharks now over the side,\\r\\n      don&rsquo;t you see they prefer it tough and rare? What a shindy they are\\r\\n      kicking up! Cook, go and talk to &rsquo;em; tell &rsquo;em they are welcome to help\\r\\n      themselves civilly, and in moderation, but they must keep quiet. Blast me,\\r\\n      if I can hear my own voice. Away, cook, and deliver my message. Here, take\\r\\n      this lantern,&rdquo; snatching one from his sideboard; &ldquo;now then, go and preach\\r\\n      to &rsquo;em!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Sullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the deck to\\r\\n      the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low over the sea,\\r\\n      so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the other hand he\\r\\n      solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the side in a mumbling\\r\\n      voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb, softly crawling behind,\\r\\n      overheard all that was said.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Fellow-critters: I&rsquo;se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise\\r\\n      dare.

That&rsquo;s no way to convert sinners, cook!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Who dat? Den preach to him yourself,&rdquo; sullenly turning to go.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;No, cook; go on, go on.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:&rdquo;&mdash;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Right!&rdquo; exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, &ldquo;coax &rsquo;em to it; try that,&rdquo; and\\r\\n      Fleece continued.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,\\r\\n      fellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness&mdash;&rsquo;top dat dam slappin&rsquo; ob de\\r\\n      tail!

The Whale as a Dish.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and,\\r\\n      like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so\\r\\n      outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and\\r\\n      philosophy of it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale\\r\\n      was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large prices there.\\r\\n      Also, that in Henry VIIIth&rsquo;s time, a certain cook of the court obtained a\\r\\n      handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with\\r\\n      barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of whale.\\r\\n      Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The meat is\\r\\n      made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being well seasoned\\r\\n      and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls. The old monks of\\r\\n      Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great porpoise grant from\\r\\n      the crown.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all hands\\r\\n      be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but when you\\r\\n      come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet long, it takes\\r\\n      away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb, nowadays\\r\\n      partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious. We all\\r\\n      know how they live upon whales, and have rare old vintages of prime old\\r\\n      train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous doctors, recommends strips\\r\\n      of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing. And\\r\\n      this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who long ago were accidentally\\r\\n      left in Greenland by a whaling vessel&mdash;that these men actually lived\\r\\n      for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left\\r\\n      ashore after trying out the blubber. Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps\\r\\n      are called &ldquo;fritters&rdquo;; which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown\\r\\n      and crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives&rsquo;\\r\\n      dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh. They have such an eatable look that\\r\\n      the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his\\r\\n      exceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be\\r\\n      delicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the\\r\\n      buffalo&rsquo;s (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid\\r\\n      pyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that is;\\r\\n      like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the third\\r\\n      month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter.\\r\\n      Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other\\r\\n      substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try watches of the night\\r\\n      it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship-biscuit into the\\r\\n      huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many a good supper have I\\r\\n      thus made.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish.\\r\\n      The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two plump,\\r\\n      whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large puddings),\\r\\n      they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most delectable mess, in\\r\\n      flavor somewhat resembling calves&rsquo; head, which is quite a dish among some\\r\\n      epicures; and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures, by\\r\\n      continually dining upon calves&rsquo; brains, by and by get to have a little\\r\\n      brains of their own, so as to be able to tell a calf&rsquo;s head from their own\\r\\n      heads; which, indeed, requires uncommon discrimination. And that is the\\r\\n      reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf&rsquo;s head before\\r\\n      him, is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see. The head looks a\\r\\n      sort of reproachfully at him, with an &ldquo;Et tu Brute!&rdquo; expression.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous\\r\\n      that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence; that\\r\\n      appears to result, in some way, from the consideration before mentioned:\\r\\n      <i>i.e.</i> that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea, and eat it\\r\\n      too by its own light. But no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox\\r\\n      was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was hung; and if he had been put on\\r\\n      his trial by oxen, he certainly would have been; and he certainly deserved\\r\\n      it if any murderer does. Go to the meat-market of a Saturday night and see\\r\\n      the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds.\\r\\n      Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal&rsquo;s jaw? Cannibals? who\\r\\n      is not a cannibal? I tell you it will be more tolerable for the Fejee that\\r\\n      salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine; it\\r\\n      will be more tolerable for that provident Fejee, I say, in the day of\\r\\n      judgment, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who nailest\\r\\n      geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy\\r\\n      patÃ©-de-foie-gras.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is adding\\r\\n      insult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my civilized\\r\\n      and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what is that handle\\r\\n      made of?&mdash;what but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are\\r\\n      eating? And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring that fat\\r\\n      goose? With a feather of the same fowl. And with what quill did the\\r\\n      Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders\\r\\n      formally indite his circulars? It is only within the last month or two\\r\\n      that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but steel pens.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0066\" id=\"link2HCH0066\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 66. The Shark Massacre.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and weary\\r\\n      toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general thing at\\r\\n      least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in. For\\r\\n      that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very soon completed;\\r\\n      and requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the common usage is to\\r\\n      take in all sail; lash the helm a&rsquo;lee; and then send every one below to\\r\\n      his hammock till daylight, with the reservation that, until that time,\\r\\n      anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and two for an hour, each\\r\\n      couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes\\r\\n      well.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will not\\r\\n      answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the\\r\\n      moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a stretch,\\r\\n      little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning. In most other\\r\\n      parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so largely abound,\\r\\n      their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished, by\\r\\n      vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a procedure\\r\\n      notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to tickle them into\\r\\n      still greater activity. But it was not thus in the present case with the\\r\\n      Pequod&rsquo;s sharks; though, to be sure, any man unaccustomed to such sights,\\r\\n      to have looked over her side that night, would have almost thought the\\r\\n      whole round sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks the maggots in it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was\\r\\n      concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on\\r\\n      deck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for immediately\\r\\n      suspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering three lanterns,\\r\\n      so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea, these two\\r\\n      mariners, darting their long whaling-spades, kept up an incessant\\r\\n      murdering of the sharks,* by striking the keen steel deep into their\\r\\n      skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the foamy confusion of\\r\\n      their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not always hit their\\r\\n      mark; and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of\\r\\n      the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at each other&rsquo;s disembowelments,\\r\\n      but like flexible bows, bent round, and bit their own; till those entrails\\r\\n      seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth, to be oppositely\\r\\n      voided by the gaping wound. Nor was this all. It was unsafe to meddle with\\r\\n      the corpses and ghosts of these creatures. A sort of generic or\\r\\n      Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones, after\\r\\n      what might be called the individual life had departed. Killed and hoisted\\r\\n      on deck for the sake of his skin, one of these sharks almost took poor\\r\\n      Queequeg&rsquo;s hand off, when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his\\r\\n      murderous jaw.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      *The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel; is\\r\\n      about the bigness of a man&rsquo;s spread hand; and in general shape,\\r\\n      corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its\\r\\n      sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than the\\r\\n      lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible; and when being\\r\\n      used is occasionally honed, just like a razor. In its socket, a stiff\\r\\n      pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Queequeg no care what god made him shark,&rdquo; said the savage, agonizingly\\r\\n      lifting his hand up and down; &ldquo;wedder Fejee god or Nantucket god; but de\\r\\n      god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0067\" id=\"link2HCH0067\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 67. Cutting In.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio\\r\\n      professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod was\\r\\n      turned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You would have\\r\\n      thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous\\r\\n      things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and which\\r\\n      no single man can possibly lift&mdash;this vast bunch of grapes was swayed\\r\\n      up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the strongest\\r\\n      point anywhere above a ship&rsquo;s deck. The end of the hawser-like rope\\r\\n      winding through these intricacies, was then conducted to the windlass, and\\r\\n      the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale; to this\\r\\n      block the great blubber hook, weighing some one hundred pounds, was\\r\\n      attached. And now suspended in stages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb,\\r\\n      the mates, armed with their long spades, began cutting a hole in the body\\r\\n      for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side-fins.\\r\\n      This done, a broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is\\r\\n      inserted, and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now\\r\\n      commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the\\r\\n      entire ship careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the\\r\\n      nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and\\r\\n      nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to\\r\\n      the whale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a\\r\\n      helping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap is\\r\\n      heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the\\r\\n      whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the\\r\\n      disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now as the\\r\\n      blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange, so is it\\r\\n      stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by\\r\\n      spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the windlass\\r\\n      continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water, and as the\\r\\n      blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the\\r\\n      &ldquo;scarf,&rdquo; simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the\\r\\n      mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very\\r\\n      act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till\\r\\n      its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the windlass then cease\\r\\n      heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping mass sways\\r\\n      to and fro as if let down from the sky, and every one present must take\\r\\n      good heed to dodge it when it swings, else it may box his ears and pitch\\r\\n      him headlong overboard.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon\\r\\n      called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices out\\r\\n      a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into this hole,\\r\\n      the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to\\r\\n      retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for what follows.\\r\\n      Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands to stand off,\\r\\n      once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong,\\r\\n      desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in twain; so that while\\r\\n      the short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip, called a\\r\\n      blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering. The heavers\\r\\n      forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is peeling and\\r\\n      hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is slowly slackened\\r\\n      away, and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right\\r\\n      beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room. Into this\\r\\n      twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long\\r\\n      blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents. And\\r\\n      thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting and lowering\\r\\n      simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the heavers singing, the\\r\\n      blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates scarfing, the ship straining,\\r\\n      and all hands swearing occasionally, by way of assuaging the general\\r\\n      friction.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0068\" id=\"link2HCH0068\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 68. The Blanket.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin of\\r\\n      the whale. I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen\\r\\n      afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion remains\\r\\n      unchanged; but it is only an opinion.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you know\\r\\n      what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence of firm,\\r\\n      close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and ranges from\\r\\n      eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature&rsquo;s\\r\\n      skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet in point of\\r\\n      fact these are no arguments against such a presumption; because you cannot\\r\\n      raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale&rsquo;s body but that same\\r\\n      blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably\\r\\n      dense, what can that be but the skin? True, from the unmarred dead body of\\r\\n      the whale, you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin,\\r\\n      transparent substance, somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of\\r\\n      isinglass, only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is,\\r\\n      previous to being dried, when it not only contracts and thickens, but\\r\\n      becomes rather hard and brittle. I have several such dried bits, which I\\r\\n      use for marks in my whale-books. It is transparent, as I said before; and\\r\\n      being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself with\\r\\n      fancying it exerted a magnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to\\r\\n      read about whales through their own spectacles, as you may say. But what I\\r\\n      am driving at here is this. That same infinitely thin, isinglass\\r\\n      substance, which, I admit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so\\r\\n      much to be regarded as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin,\\r\\n      so to speak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of\\r\\n      the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a\\r\\n      new-born child. But no more of this.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin, as\\r\\n      in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one\\r\\n      hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity, or\\r\\n      rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three fourths,\\r\\n      and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence be had of\\r\\n      the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose mere\\r\\n      integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning ten barrels to\\r\\n      the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of\\r\\n      the stuff of the whale&rsquo;s skin.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the\\r\\n      many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over obliquely\\r\\n      crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array,\\r\\n      something like those in the finest Italian line engravings. But these\\r\\n      marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above\\r\\n      mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as if they were engraved upon\\r\\n      the body itself. Nor is this all. In some instances, to the quick,\\r\\n      observant eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but afford\\r\\n      the ground for far other delineations. These are hieroglyphical; that is,\\r\\n      if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids\\r\\n      hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present\\r\\n      connexion. By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm\\r\\n      Whale in particular, I was much struck with a plate representing the old\\r\\n      Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the\\r\\n      banks of the Upper Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too, the\\r\\n      mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable. This allusion to the Indian\\r\\n      rocks reminds me of another thing. Besides all the other phenomena which\\r\\n      the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the back,\\r\\n      and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the regular\\r\\n      linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an\\r\\n      irregular, random aspect. I should say that those New England rocks on the\\r\\n      sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping\\r\\n      contact with vast floating icebergs&mdash;I should say, that those rocks\\r\\n      must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also\\r\\n      seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile\\r\\n      contact with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large,\\r\\n      full-grown bulls of the species.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the\\r\\n      whale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long\\r\\n      pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very happy\\r\\n      and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a\\r\\n      real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho slipt over\\r\\n      his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of this cosy\\r\\n      blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep himself\\r\\n      comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides. What would\\r\\n      become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy seas of the\\r\\n      North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other fish are found\\r\\n      exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but these, be it observed,\\r\\n      are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies are\\r\\n      refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the lee of an\\r\\n      iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire; whereas,\\r\\n      like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his blood, and he\\r\\n      dies. How wonderful is it then&mdash;except after explanation&mdash;that\\r\\n      this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is\\r\\n      to man; how wonderful that he should be found at home, immersed to his\\r\\n      lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall overboard,\\r\\n      they are sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly frozen into\\r\\n      the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued in amber. But more\\r\\n      surprising is it to know, as has been proved by experiment, that the blood\\r\\n      of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in summer.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong\\r\\n      individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare\\r\\n      virtue of interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself after\\r\\n      the whale! Do thou, too, remain warm among ice. Do thou, too, live in this\\r\\n      world without being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep thy blood fluid at\\r\\n      the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter&rsquo;s, and like the great whale,\\r\\n      retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of thine own.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! Of erections,\\r\\n      how few are domed like St. Peter&rsquo;s! of creatures, how few vast as the\\r\\n      whale!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0069\" id=\"link2HCH0069\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 69. The Funeral.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Haul in the chains! Let the carcase go astern!&rdquo;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body of the\\r\\n      beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in hue, it\\r\\n      has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is still colossal. Slowly it\\r\\n      floats more and more away, the water round it torn and splashed by the\\r\\n      insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed with rapacious flights of\\r\\n      screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so many insulting poniards in the\\r\\n      whale. The vast white headless phantom floats further and further from the\\r\\n      ship, and every rod that it so floats, what seem square roods of sharks\\r\\n      and cubic roods of fowls, augment the murderous din. For hours and hours\\r\\n      from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen. Beneath the\\r\\n      unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair face of the pleasant sea,\\r\\n      wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass of death floats on and on,\\r\\n      till lost in infinite perspectives.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      There&rsquo;s a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-vultures all in\\r\\n      pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled. In\\r\\n      life but few of them would have helped the whale, I ween, if peradventure\\r\\n      he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do\\r\\n      pounce. Oh, horrible vultureism of earth! from which not the mightiest\\r\\n      whale is free.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost survives\\r\\n      and hovers over it to scare. Espied by some timid man-of-war or blundering\\r\\n      discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring the swarming\\r\\n      fowls, nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun, and\\r\\n      the white spray heaving high against it; straightway the whale&rsquo;s unharming\\r\\n      corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the log&mdash;<i>shoals, rocks,\\r\\n      and breakers hereabouts: beware!</i> And for years afterwards, perhaps, ships\\r\\n      shun the place; leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum, because\\r\\n      their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held. There&rsquo;s your\\r\\n      law of precedents; there&rsquo;s your utility of traditions; there&rsquo;s the story\\r\\n      of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on the earth, and\\r\\n      now not even hovering in the air! There&rsquo;s orthodoxy!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Thus, while in life the great whale&rsquo;s body may have been a real terror to\\r\\n      his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Are you a believer in ghosts, my friend?

The Sphynx.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the\\r\\n      body of the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the beheading of the Sperm\\r\\n      Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced whale\\r\\n      surgeons very much pride themselves: and not without reason.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck; on\\r\\n      the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that very\\r\\n      place, is the thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the surgeon must\\r\\n      operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his\\r\\n      subject, and that subject almost hidden in a discoloured, rolling, and\\r\\n      oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear in mind, too, that under\\r\\n      these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh;\\r\\n      and in that subterraneous manner, without so much as getting one single\\r\\n      peep into the ever-contracting gash thus made, he must skilfully steer\\r\\n      clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts, and exactly divide the spine at\\r\\n      a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull. Do you not marvel,\\r\\n      then, at Stubb&rsquo;s boast, that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm\\r\\n      whale?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable\\r\\n      till the body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small whale it is\\r\\n      hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a full grown\\r\\n      leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale&rsquo;s head embraces nearly\\r\\n      one third of his entire bulk, and completely to suspend such a burden as\\r\\n      that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this were as vain a thing\\r\\n      as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers&rsquo; scales.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The Pequod&rsquo;s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head was\\r\\n      hoisted against the ship&rsquo;s side&mdash;about half way out of the sea, so\\r\\n      that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. And\\r\\n      there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of the\\r\\n      enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm on\\r\\n      that side projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that\\r\\n      blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod&rsquo;s waist like the giant Holofernes&rsquo;s\\r\\n      from the girdle of Judith.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      When this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went\\r\\n      below to their dinner. Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now\\r\\n      deserted deck. An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow lotus, was\\r\\n      more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone from\\r\\n      his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to gaze over\\r\\n      the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took Stubb&rsquo;s long\\r\\n      spade&mdash;still remaining there after the whale&rsquo;s decapitation&mdash;and\\r\\n      striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended mass, placed its\\r\\n      other end crutch-wise under one arm, and so stood leaning over with eyes\\r\\n      attentively fixed on this head.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so\\r\\n      intense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx&rsquo;s in the desert. &ldquo;Speak, thou vast\\r\\n      and venerable head,&rdquo; muttered Ahab, &ldquo;which, though ungarnished with a\\r\\n      beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty head,\\r\\n      and tell us the secret thing that is in thee. Of all divers, thou hast\\r\\n      dived the deepest. That head upon which the upper sun now gleams, has\\r\\n      moved amid this world&rsquo;s foundations. Where unrecorded names and navies\\r\\n      rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous hold this\\r\\n      frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned; there,\\r\\n      in that awful water-land, there was thy most familiar home. Thou hast been\\r\\n      where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many a sailor&rsquo;s side, where\\r\\n      sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down. Thou saw&rsquo;st the\\r\\n      locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart they\\r\\n      sank beneath the exulting wave; true to each other, when heaven seemed\\r\\n      false to them. Thou saw&rsquo;st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from\\r\\n      the midnight deck; for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the\\r\\n      insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed on unharmed&mdash;while\\r\\n      swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a\\r\\n      righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms.

Well, now, that&rsquo;s cheering,&rdquo; cried Ahab, suddenly erecting himself,\\r\\n      while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow. &ldquo;That lively cry\\r\\n      upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better man.&mdash;Where\\r\\n      away?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze to\\r\\n      us!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Better and better, man.

The Jeroboam&rsquo;s Story.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster than the\\r\\n      ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      By and by, through the glass the stranger&rsquo;s boats and manned mast-heads\\r\\n      proved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and shooting\\r\\n      by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the Pequod could not\\r\\n      hope to reach her. So the signal was set to see what response would be\\r\\n      made.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships of\\r\\n      the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which signals\\r\\n      being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels\\r\\n      attached, every captain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale commanders\\r\\n      are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even at considerable\\r\\n      distances and with no small facility.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The Pequod&rsquo;s signal was at last responded to by the stranger&rsquo;s setting her\\r\\n      own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket. Squaring her\\r\\n      yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod&rsquo;s lee, and lowered a\\r\\n      boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was being rigged by\\r\\n      Starbuck&rsquo;s order to accommodate the visiting captain, the stranger in\\r\\n      question waved his hand from his boat&rsquo;s stern in token of that proceeding\\r\\n      being entirely unnecessary. It turned out that the Jeroboam had a\\r\\n      malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of\\r\\n      infecting the Pequod&rsquo;s company. For, though himself and boat&rsquo;s crew\\r\\n      remained untainted, and though his ship was half a rifle-shot off, and an\\r\\n      incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between; yet conscientiously\\r\\n      adhering to the timid quarantine of the land, he peremptorily refused to\\r\\n      come into direct contact with the Pequod.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an\\r\\n      interval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam&rsquo;s\\r\\n      boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the\\r\\n      Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by this time it blew\\r\\n      very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times by the\\r\\n      sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed some way\\r\\n      ahead; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again.\\r\\n      Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now and then, a\\r\\n      conversation was sustained between the two parties; but at intervals not\\r\\n      without still another interruption of a very different sort.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam&rsquo;s boat, was a man of a singular appearance,\\r\\n      even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all\\r\\n      totalities. He was a small, short, youngish man, sprinkled all over his\\r\\n      face with freckles, and wearing redundant yellow hair. A long-skirted,\\r\\n      cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him; the\\r\\n      overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists. A deep,\\r\\n      settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\\r\\n      he! that&rsquo;s he!&mdash;the long-togged scaramouch the Town-Ho&rsquo;s company told\\r\\n      us of!&rdquo; Stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the Jeroboam, and a\\r\\n      certain man among her crew, some time previous when the Pequod spoke the\\r\\n      Town-Ho. According to this account and what was subsequently learned, it\\r\\n      seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency\\r\\n      over almost everybody in the Jeroboam. His story was this:\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna\\r\\n      Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret\\r\\n      meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a\\r\\n      trap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he\\r\\n      carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing gunpowder,\\r\\n      was supposed to be charged with laudanum. A strange, apostolic whim having\\r\\n      seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket, where, with that cunning\\r\\n      peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady, common-sense exterior, and\\r\\n      offered himself as a green-hand candidate for the Jeroboam&rsquo;s whaling\\r\\n      voyage. They engaged him; but straightway upon the ship&rsquo;s getting out of\\r\\n      sight of land, his insanity broke out in a freshet. He announced himself\\r\\n      as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded the captain to jump overboard. He\\r\\n      published his manifesto, whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of\\r\\n      the isles of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching\\r\\n      earnestness with which he declared these things;&mdash;the dark, daring\\r\\n      play of his sleepless, excited imagination, and all the preternatural\\r\\n      terrors of real delirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of\\r\\n      the majority of the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness.\\r\\n      Moreover, they were afraid of him. As such a man, however, was not of much\\r\\n      practical use in the ship, especially as he refused to work except when he\\r\\n      pleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him; but\\r\\n      apprised that that individual&rsquo;s intention was to land him in the first\\r\\n      convenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials&mdash;devoting\\r\\n      the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention\\r\\n      was carried out. So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the\\r\\n      crew, that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if\\r\\n      Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain. He was\\r\\n      therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel to\\r\\n      be any way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it came to pass\\r\\n      that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship. The consequence of all\\r\\n      this was, that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and\\r\\n      mates; and since the epidemic had broken out, he carried a higher hand\\r\\n      than ever; declaring that the plague, as he called it, was at his sole\\r\\n      command; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure. The\\r\\n      sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him;\\r\\n      in obedience to his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage,\\r\\n      as to a god. Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they\\r\\n      are true. Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to\\r\\n      the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless\\r\\n      power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is time to\\r\\n      return to the Pequod.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I fear not thy epidemic, man,&rdquo; said Ahab from the bulwarks, to Captain\\r\\n      Mayhew, who stood in the boat&rsquo;s stern; &ldquo;come on board.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But now Gabriel started to his feet.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware of the horrible\\r\\n      plague!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Gabriel! Gabriel!&rdquo; cried Captain Mayhew; &ldquo;thou must either&mdash;&rdquo; But\\r\\n      that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its seethings\\r\\n      drowned all speech.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Hast thou seen the White Whale?&rdquo; demanded Ahab, when the boat drifted\\r\\n      back.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! Beware of the horrible\\r\\n      tail!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I tell thee again, Gabriel, that&mdash;&rdquo; But again the boat tore ahead as\\r\\n      if dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a\\r\\n      succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional\\r\\n      caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the hoisted\\r\\n      sperm whale&rsquo;s head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was seen\\r\\n      eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature\\r\\n      seemed to warrant.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning\\r\\n      Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from Gabriel,\\r\\n      whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed leagued\\r\\n      with him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking a\\r\\n      whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby\\r\\n      Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this intelligence,\\r\\n      Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White Whale, in\\r\\n      case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering insanity, pronouncing\\r\\n      the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated; the\\r\\n      Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some year or two afterwards, Moby\\r\\n      Dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned\\r\\n      with ardour to encounter him; and the captain himself being not unwilling\\r\\n      to let him have the opportunity, despite all the archangel&rsquo;s denunciations\\r\\n      and forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.\\r\\n      With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many perilous,\\r\\n      unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast.\\r\\n      Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was tossing one\\r\\n      arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to\\r\\n      the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while Macey, the mate,\\r\\n      was standing up in his boat&rsquo;s bow, and with all the reckless energy of his\\r\\n      tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to\\r\\n      get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from\\r\\n      the sea; by its quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out\\r\\n      of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of\\r\\n      furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc in\\r\\n      his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a\\r\\n      chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman&rsquo;s head; but the\\r\\n      mate for ever sank.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the\\r\\n      Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.\\r\\n      Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated; oftener\\r\\n      the boat&rsquo;s bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the headsman\\r\\n      stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body. But strangest of\\r\\n      all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one, when the body\\r\\n      has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is discernible; the man\\r\\n      being stark dead.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly descried\\r\\n      from the ship. Raising a piercing shriek&mdash;&ldquo;The vial! the vial!&rdquo;\\r\\n       Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of\\r\\n      the whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence;\\r\\n      because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically\\r\\n      fore-announced it, instead of only making a general prophecy, which any\\r\\n      one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the\\r\\n      wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror to the ship.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him,\\r\\n      that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended\\r\\n      to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which Ahab\\r\\n      answered&mdash;&ldquo;Aye.&rdquo; Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started to his\\r\\n      feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with downward\\r\\n      pointed finger&mdash;&ldquo;Think, think of the blasphemer&mdash;dead, and down\\r\\n      there!&mdash;beware of the blasphemer&rsquo;s end!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, &ldquo;Captain, I have just\\r\\n      bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy officers,\\r\\n      if I mistake not. Starbuck, look over the bag.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships,\\r\\n      whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed, depends upon\\r\\n      the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans. Thus, most\\r\\n      letters never reach their mark; and many are only received after attaining\\r\\n      an age of two or three years or more.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely tumbled,\\r\\n      damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in consequence of\\r\\n      being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such a letter, Death himself\\r\\n      might well have been the post-boy.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;st not read it?&rdquo; cried Ahab. &ldquo;Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it&rsquo;s but a\\r\\n      dim scrawl;&mdash;what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a\\r\\n      long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to\\r\\n      insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without its\\r\\n      coming any closer to the ship.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, &ldquo;Mr. Har&mdash;yes, Mr. Harry&mdash;(a\\r\\n      woman&rsquo;s pinny hand,&mdash;the man&rsquo;s wife, I&rsquo;ll wager)&mdash;Aye&mdash;Mr.\\r\\n      Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;&mdash;why it&rsquo;s Macey, and he&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,&rdquo; sighed Mayhew; &ldquo;but let me\\r\\n      have it.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Nay, keep it thyself,&rdquo; cried Gabriel to Ahab; &ldquo;thou art soon going that\\r\\n      way.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Curses throttle thee!&rdquo; yelled Ahab. &ldquo;Captain Mayhew, stand by now to\\r\\n      receive it&rdquo;; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck&rsquo;s hands, he caught\\r\\n      it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the boat. But as\\r\\n      he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing; the boat drifted\\r\\n      a little towards the ship&rsquo;s stern; so that, as if by magic, the letter\\r\\n      suddenly ranged along with Gabriel&rsquo;s eager hand. He clutched it in an\\r\\n      instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the letter on it, sent it\\r\\n      thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab&rsquo;s feet. Then Gabriel\\r\\n      shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars, and in that\\r\\n      manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of\\r\\n      the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild\\r\\n      affair.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0072\" id=\"link2HCH0072\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there\\r\\n      is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are\\r\\n      wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in\\r\\n      any one place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done\\r\\n      everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of\\r\\n      the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that\\r\\n      upon first breaking ground in the whale&rsquo;s back, the blubber-hook was\\r\\n      inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates. But\\r\\n      how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that\\r\\n      hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty\\r\\n      it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster&rsquo;s back for the special\\r\\n      purpose referred to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that\\r\\n      the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or\\r\\n      stripping operation is concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost\\r\\n      entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down\\r\\n      there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer\\r\\n      flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass\\r\\n      revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question,\\r\\n      Queequeg figured in the Highland costume&mdash;a shirt and socks&mdash;in\\r\\n      which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one\\r\\n      had a better chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Being the savage&rsquo;s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar in\\r\\n      his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to attend\\r\\n      upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead whale&rsquo;s\\r\\n      back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long\\r\\n      cord. Just so, from the ship&rsquo;s steep side, did I hold Queequeg down there\\r\\n      in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope,\\r\\n      attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we\\r\\n      proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both\\r\\n      ends; fast to Queequeg&rsquo;s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow leather\\r\\n      one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were wedded;\\r\\n      and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage and honor\\r\\n      demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag me down in his\\r\\n      wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature united us. Queequeg was my\\r\\n      own inseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous\\r\\n      liabilities which the hempen bond entailed.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that\\r\\n      while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive that\\r\\n      my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two; that\\r\\n      my free will had received a mortal wound; and that another&rsquo;s mistake or\\r\\n      misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death.\\r\\n      Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in Providence; for\\r\\n      its even-handed equity never could have so gross an injustice. And yet\\r\\n      still further pondering&mdash;while I jerked him now and then from between\\r\\n      the whale and ship, which would threaten to jam him&mdash;still further\\r\\n      pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine was the precise\\r\\n      situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way\\r\\n      or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals. If\\r\\n      your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you\\r\\n      poison in your pills, you die. True, you may say that, by exceeding\\r\\n      caution, you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil\\r\\n      chances of life. But handle Queequeg&rsquo;s monkey-rope heedfully as I would,\\r\\n      sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard. Nor\\r\\n      could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had the management\\r\\n      of one end of it.*\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      *The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod\\r\\n      that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This improvement\\r\\n      upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb, in\\r\\n      order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee\\r\\n      for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale\\r\\n      and the ship&mdash;where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant\\r\\n      rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he\\r\\n      was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the\\r\\n      night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent\\r\\n      blood which began to flow from the carcass&mdash;the rabid creatures\\r\\n      swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them aside\\r\\n      with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it not that\\r\\n      attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise miscellaneously\\r\\n      carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous\\r\\n      finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them.\\r\\n      Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then jerked the\\r\\n      poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a\\r\\n      peculiarly ferocious shark&mdash;he was provided with still another\\r\\n      protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and\\r\\n      Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale-spades,\\r\\n      wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach. This\\r\\n      procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and benevolent of\\r\\n      them. They meant Queequeg&rsquo;s best happiness, I admit; but in their hasty\\r\\n      zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both he and the\\r\\n      sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water, those\\r\\n      indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a\\r\\n      tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there with that\\r\\n      great iron hook&mdash;poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo,\\r\\n      and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in and\\r\\n      then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea&mdash;what matters it,\\r\\n      after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in\\r\\n      this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those\\r\\n      sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks and\\r\\n      spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now, as\\r\\n      with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up\\r\\n      the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the\\r\\n      side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent, consolatory glance\\r\\n      hands him&mdash;what? Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye gods! hands him a\\r\\n      cup of tepid ginger and water!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Ginger? Do I smell ginger?&rdquo; suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near. &ldquo;Yes,\\r\\n      this must be ginger,&rdquo; peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then standing\\r\\n      as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the astonished\\r\\n      steward slowly saying, &ldquo;Ginger? ginger? and will you have the goodness to\\r\\n      tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of ginger? Ginger! is ginger\\r\\n      the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to kindle a fire in this shivering\\r\\n      cannibal? Ginger!&mdash;what the devil is ginger? Sea-coal? firewood?&mdash;lucifer\\r\\n      matches?&mdash;tinder?&mdash;gunpowder?&mdash;what the devil is ginger, I\\r\\n      say, that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this business,&rdquo;\\r\\n       he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just come from\\r\\n      forward. &ldquo;Will you look at that kannakin, sir: smell of it, if you\\r\\n      please.&rdquo; Then watching the mate&rsquo;s countenance, he added, &ldquo;The steward, Mr.\\r\\n      Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg, there,\\r\\n      this instant off the whale. Is the steward an apothecary, sir? and may I\\r\\n      ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life\\r\\n      into a half-drowned man?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I trust not,&rdquo; said Starbuck, &ldquo;it is poor stuff enough.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, aye, steward,&rdquo; cried Stubb, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll teach you to drug a harpooneer;\\r\\n      none of your apothecary&rsquo;s medicine here; you want to poison us, do ye? You\\r\\n      have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all, and pocket\\r\\n      the proceeds, do ye?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;It was not me,&rdquo; cried Dough-Boy, &ldquo;it was Aunt Charity that brought the\\r\\n      ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits, but\\r\\n      only this ginger-jub&mdash;so she called it.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to the\\r\\n      lockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr. Starbuck. It\\r\\n      is the captain&rsquo;s orders&mdash;grog for the harpooneer on a whale.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; replied Starbuck, &ldquo;only don&rsquo;t hit him again, but&mdash;&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of\\r\\n      that sort; and this fellow&rsquo;s a weazel. What were you about saying, sir?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a sort\\r\\n      of tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and was\\r\\n      handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity&rsquo;s gift, and that was\\r\\n      freely given to the waves.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0073\" id=\"link2HCH0073\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk over Him.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale&rsquo;s\\r\\n      prodigious head hanging to the Pequod&rsquo;s side. But we must let it continue\\r\\n      hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it. For the\\r\\n      present other matters press, and the best we can do now for the head, is\\r\\n      to pray heaven the tackles may hold.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually drifted\\r\\n      into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit, gave unusual\\r\\n      tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the Leviathan that\\r\\n      but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near. And\\r\\n      though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior\\r\\n      creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them\\r\\n      at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near the Crozetts\\r\\n      without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought\\r\\n      alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the announcement was made\\r\\n      that a Right Whale should be captured that day, if opportunity offered.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two\\r\\n      boats, Stubb&rsquo;s and Flask&rsquo;s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further and\\r\\n      further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at the\\r\\n      mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of\\r\\n      tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or\\r\\n      both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in\\r\\n      plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the\\r\\n      towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first it\\r\\n      seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom,\\r\\n      within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from view, as if\\r\\n      diving under the keel. &ldquo;Cut, cut!&rdquo; was the cry from the ship to the boats,\\r\\n      which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly\\r\\n      dash against the vessel&rsquo;s side. But having plenty of line yet in the tubs,\\r\\n      and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope,\\r\\n      and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the\\r\\n      ship. For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while\\r\\n      they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction, and still\\r\\n      plied their oars in another, the contending strain threatened to take them\\r\\n      under. But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain. And they\\r\\n      stuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt\\r\\n      running like lightning along the keel, as the strained line, scraping\\r\\n      beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and\\r\\n      quivering; and so flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like\\r\\n      bits of broken glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to\\r\\n      sight, and once more the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale\\r\\n      abated his speed, and blindly altering his course, went round the stern of\\r\\n      the ship towing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete\\r\\n      circuit.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close flanking\\r\\n      him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance; and thus\\r\\n      round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the multitudes of sharks\\r\\n      that had before swum round the Sperm Whale&rsquo;s body, rushed to the fresh\\r\\n      blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every new gash, as the eager\\r\\n      Israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten\\r\\n      rock.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he\\r\\n      turned upon his back a corpse.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,\\r\\n      and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some\\r\\n      conversation ensued between them.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,&rdquo; said Stubb,\\r\\n      not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a\\r\\n      leviathan.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Wants with it?&rdquo; said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat&rsquo;s bow,\\r\\n      &ldquo;did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale&rsquo;s head\\r\\n      hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right Whale&rsquo;s on the\\r\\n      larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can never afterwards\\r\\n      capsize?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Why not?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so, and\\r\\n      he seems to know all about ships&rsquo; charms. But I sometimes think he&rsquo;ll\\r\\n      charm the ship to no good at last. I don&rsquo;t half like that chap, Stubb. Did\\r\\n      you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake&rsquo;s\\r\\n      head, Stubb?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a\\r\\n      dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look down\\r\\n      there, Flask&rdquo;&mdash;pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both\\r\\n      hands&mdash;&ldquo;Aye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in\\r\\n      disguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been\\r\\n      stowed away on board ship? He&rsquo;s the devil, I say. The reason why you don&rsquo;t\\r\\n      see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries it coiled\\r\\n      away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of it, he&rsquo;s\\r\\n      always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He sleeps in his boots, don&rsquo;t he? He hasn&rsquo;t got any hammock; but I&rsquo;ve\\r\\n      seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;No doubt, and it&rsquo;s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye\\r\\n      see, in the eye of the rigging.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the old man have so much to do with him for?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Bargain?&mdash;about what?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and the\\r\\n      devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away his\\r\\n      silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then he&rsquo;ll\\r\\n      surrender Moby Dick.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Pooh!

Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flag-ship\\r\\n      once, switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike, and\\r\\n      inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he was at home, and asked\\r\\n      the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching his hoofs, up and says, &lsquo;I\\r\\n      want John.&rsquo; &lsquo;What for?&rsquo; says the old governor. &lsquo;What business is that of\\r\\n      yours,&rsquo; says the devil, getting mad,&mdash;&lsquo;I want to use him.&rsquo; &lsquo;Take\\r\\n      him,&rsquo; says the governor&mdash;and by the Lord, Flask, if the devil didn&rsquo;t\\r\\n      give John the Asiatic cholera before he got through with him, I&rsquo;ll eat\\r\\n      this whale in one mouthful. But look sharp&mdash;ain&rsquo;t you all ready\\r\\n      there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let&rsquo;s get the whale alongside.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I think I remember some such story as you were telling,&rdquo; said Flask, when\\r\\n      at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the\\r\\n      ship, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t remember where.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes? Did ye\\r\\n      read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me, Stubb,\\r\\n      do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was the same\\r\\n      you say is now on board the Pequod?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn&rsquo;t the devil live for\\r\\n      ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any parson\\r\\n      a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a latch-key to get\\r\\n      into the admiral&rsquo;s cabin, don&rsquo;t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole?\\r\\n      Tell me that, Mr. Flask?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Do you see that mainmast there?&rdquo; pointing to the ship; &ldquo;well, that&rsquo;s the\\r\\n      figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod&rsquo;s hold, and string along\\r\\n      in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that wouldn&rsquo;t begin\\r\\n      to be Fedallah&rsquo;s age. Nor all the coopers in creation couldn&rsquo;t show hoops\\r\\n      enough to make oughts enough.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you\\r\\n      meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if he&rsquo;s\\r\\n      so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to live for\\r\\n      ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard&mdash;tell me that?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Give him a good ducking, anyhow.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;But he&rsquo;d crawl back.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Duck him again; and keep ducking him.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though&mdash;yes,\\r\\n      and drown you&mdash;what then?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I should like to see him try it; I&rsquo;d give him such a pair of black eyes\\r\\n      that he wouldn&rsquo;t dare to show his face in the admiral&rsquo;s cabin again for a\\r\\n      long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he lives, and\\r\\n      hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn the devil,\\r\\n      Flask; so you suppose I&rsquo;m afraid of the devil? Who&rsquo;s afraid of him, except\\r\\n      the old governor who daresn&rsquo;t catch him and put him in double-darbies, as\\r\\n      he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping people; aye, and signed a\\r\\n      bond with him, that all the people the devil kidnapped, he&rsquo;d roast for\\r\\n      him? There&rsquo;s a governor!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Do I suppose it? You&rsquo;ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now to\\r\\n      keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious going\\r\\n      on, I&rsquo;ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say&mdash;Look here,\\r\\n      Beelzebub, you don&rsquo;t do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord I&rsquo;ll\\r\\n      make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan, and give\\r\\n      him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come short off at the\\r\\n      stump&mdash;do you see; and then, I rather guess when he finds himself\\r\\n      docked in that queer fashion, he&rsquo;ll sneak off without the poor\\r\\n      satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;&mdash;what else?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side, where\\r\\n      fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you so?&rdquo; said Flask; &ldquo;yes, you&rsquo;ll soon see this right\\r\\n      whale&rsquo;s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti&rsquo;s.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In good time, Flask&rsquo;s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply\\r\\n      leaned over towards the sperm whale&rsquo;s head, now, by the counterpoise of\\r\\n      both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may\\r\\n      well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke&rsquo;s head, you go over\\r\\n      that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant&rsquo;s and you come back\\r\\n      again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep trimming\\r\\n      boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard, and then\\r\\n      you will float light and right.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the\\r\\n      ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case\\r\\n      of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off whole,\\r\\n      but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted\\r\\n      on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the\\r\\n      crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present case, had been done.\\r\\n      The carcases of both whales had dropped astern; and the head-laden ship\\r\\n      not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale&rsquo;s head, and ever and\\r\\n      anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand.\\r\\n      And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his shadow; while,\\r\\n      if the Parsee&rsquo;s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with, and\\r\\n      lengthen Ahab&rsquo;s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish speculations were\\r\\n      bandied among them, concerning all these passing things.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0074\" id=\"link2HCH0074\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 74. The Sperm Whale&rsquo;s Head&mdash;Contrasted View.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us join\\r\\n      them, and lay together our own.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right\\r\\n      Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales regularly\\r\\n      hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two extremes of all\\r\\n      the known varieties of the whale. As the external difference between them\\r\\n      is mainly observable in their heads; and as a head of each is this moment\\r\\n      hanging from the Pequod&rsquo;s side; and as we may freely go from one to the\\r\\n      other, by merely stepping across the deck:&mdash;where, I should like to\\r\\n      know, will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than\\r\\n      here?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these\\r\\n      heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a certain\\r\\n      mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale&rsquo;s which the Right Whale&rsquo;s sadly\\r\\n      lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale&rsquo;s head. As you behold\\r\\n      it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in point of\\r\\n      pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity is\\r\\n      heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit, giving\\r\\n      token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he is what the\\r\\n      fishermen technically call a &ldquo;grey-headed whale.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads&mdash;namely, the\\r\\n      two most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of\\r\\n      the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale&rsquo;s jaw, if you\\r\\n      narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would\\r\\n      fancy to be a young colt&rsquo;s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the\\r\\n      magnitude of the head.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale&rsquo;s eyes, it is plain\\r\\n      that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more than he\\r\\n      can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale&rsquo;s eyes\\r\\n      corresponds to that of a man&rsquo;s ears; and you may fancy, for yourself, how\\r\\n      it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects through your ears.\\r\\n      You would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision\\r\\n      in advance of the straight side-line of sight; and about thirty more\\r\\n      behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with\\r\\n      dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more\\r\\n      than if he were stealing upon you from behind. In a word, you would have\\r\\n      two backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side\\r\\n      fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man&mdash;what, indeed,\\r\\n      but his eyes?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes\\r\\n      are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to\\r\\n      produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of the\\r\\n      whale&rsquo;s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid\\r\\n      head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes\\r\\n      in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the impressions which\\r\\n      each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore, must see one\\r\\n      distinct picture on this side, and another distinct picture on that side;\\r\\n      while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him. Man\\r\\n      may, in effect, be said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with\\r\\n      two joined sashes for his window. But with the whale, these two sashes are\\r\\n      separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing the\\r\\n      view. This peculiarity of the whale&rsquo;s eyes is a thing always to be borne\\r\\n      in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader in some\\r\\n      subsequent scenes.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\\r\\n      visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a\\r\\n      hint. So long as a man&rsquo;s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing is\\r\\n      involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever\\r\\n      objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one&rsquo;s experience will teach him,\\r\\n      that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one\\r\\n      glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to\\r\\n      examine any two things&mdash;however large or however small&mdash;at one\\r\\n      and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side and\\r\\n      touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two objects, and\\r\\n      surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one\\r\\n      of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other\\r\\n      will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness. How is it,\\r\\n      then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in themselves, must\\r\\n      simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,\\r\\n      combining, and subtle than man&rsquo;s, that he can at the same moment of time\\r\\n      attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of him, and\\r\\n      the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he can, then is it as\\r\\n      marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able simultaneously to go\\r\\n      through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid. Nor,\\r\\n      strictly investigated, is there any incongruity in this comparison.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\\r\\n      extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset\\r\\n      by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer frights, so\\r\\n      common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly proceeds from the\\r\\n      helpless perplexity of volition, in which their divided and diametrically\\r\\n      opposite powers of vision must involve them.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an\\r\\n      entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for\\r\\n      hours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf\\r\\n      whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so\\r\\n      wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With\\r\\n      respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed between\\r\\n      the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has an external\\r\\n      opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a\\r\\n      membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the world\\r\\n      through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which is\\r\\n      smaller than a hare&rsquo;s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens of\\r\\n      Herschel&rsquo;s great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of\\r\\n      cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of\\r\\n      hearing? Not at all.&mdash;Why then do you try to &ldquo;enlarge&rdquo; your mind?\\r\\n      Subtilize it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant\\r\\n      over the sperm whale&rsquo;s head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending by\\r\\n      a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not that\\r\\n      the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we might\\r\\n      descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But let us\\r\\n      hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What a really\\r\\n      beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling, lined, or\\r\\n      rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as bridal satins.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems like\\r\\n      the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one end,\\r\\n      instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead, and\\r\\n      expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such, alas!\\r\\n      it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these spikes fall\\r\\n      with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold, when fathoms\\r\\n      down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there suspended, with\\r\\n      his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging straight down at\\r\\n      right-angles with his body, for all the world like a ship&rsquo;s jib-boom. This\\r\\n      whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of sorts, perhaps;\\r\\n      hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed,\\r\\n      leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a reproach to all his\\r\\n      tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In most cases this lower jaw&mdash;being easily unhinged by a practised\\r\\n      artist&mdash;is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of\\r\\n      extracting the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white\\r\\n      whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles,\\r\\n      including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an\\r\\n      anchor; and when the proper time comes&mdash;some few days after the other\\r\\n      work&mdash;Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished\\r\\n      dentists, are set to drawing teeth. With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg\\r\\n      lances the gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle\\r\\n      being rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag\\r\\n      stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. There are generally forty-two\\r\\n      teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed; nor filled\\r\\n      after our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs, and\\r\\n      piled away like joists for building houses.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0075\" id=\"link2HCH0075\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 75. The Right Whale&rsquo;s Head&mdash;Contrasted View.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right Whale&rsquo;s\\r\\n      head.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale&rsquo;s head may be compared to a\\r\\n      Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly rounded);\\r\\n      so, at a broad view, the Right Whale&rsquo;s head bears a rather inelegant\\r\\n      resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred years ago an old\\r\\n      Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker&rsquo;s last. And in this\\r\\n      same last or shoe, that old woman of the nursery tale, with the swarming\\r\\n      brood, might very comfortably be lodged, she and all her progeny.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different\\r\\n      aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit and\\r\\n      look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole head for\\r\\n      an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in its\\r\\n      sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange,\\r\\n      crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass&mdash;this green,\\r\\n      barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the &ldquo;crown,&rdquo; and the Southern\\r\\n      fishers the &ldquo;bonnet&rdquo; of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes solely on this,\\r\\n      you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak, with a bird&rsquo;s nest\\r\\n      in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle\\r\\n      here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you;\\r\\n      unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term &ldquo;crown&rdquo;\\r\\n       also bestowed upon it; in which case you will take great interest in\\r\\n      thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea,\\r\\n      whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner.\\r\\n      But if this whale be a king, he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a\\r\\n      diadem. Look at that hanging lower lip! what a huge sulk and pout is\\r\\n      there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter&rsquo;s measurement, about twenty feet long\\r\\n      and five feet deep; a sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons\\r\\n      of oil and more.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped. The\\r\\n      fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an important\\r\\n      interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when earthquakes caused the\\r\\n      beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery threshold, we now slide\\r\\n      into the mouth. Upon my word were I at Mackinaw, I should take this to be\\r\\n      the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah\\r\\n      went? The roof is about twelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp\\r\\n      angle, as if there were a regular ridge-pole there; while these ribbed,\\r\\n      arched, hairy sides, present us with those wondrous, half vertical,\\r\\n      scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone, say three hundred on a side, which\\r\\n      depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone, form those\\r\\n      Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned. The edges\\r\\n      of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres, through which the Right\\r\\n      Whale strains the water, and in whose intricacies he retains the small\\r\\n      fish, when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time.\\r\\n      In the central blinds of bone, as they stand in their natural order, there\\r\\n      are certain curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some\\r\\n      whalemen calculate the creature&rsquo;s age, as the age of an oak by its\\r\\n      circular rings. Though the certainty of this criterion is far from\\r\\n      demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical probability. At any rate,\\r\\n      if we yield to it, we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than\\r\\n      at first glance will seem reasonable.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies\\r\\n      concerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous\\r\\n      &ldquo;whiskers&rdquo; inside of the whale&rsquo;s mouth;* another, &ldquo;hogs&rsquo; bristles&rdquo;; a\\r\\n      third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:\\r\\n      &ldquo;There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his\\r\\n      upper <i>chop</i>, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      *This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or\\r\\n      rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper\\r\\n      part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts impart a\\r\\n      rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As every one knows, these same &ldquo;hogs&rsquo; bristles,&rdquo; &ldquo;fins,&rdquo; &ldquo;whiskers,&rdquo;\\r\\n       &ldquo;blinds,&rdquo; or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and\\r\\n      other stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has long\\r\\n      been on the decline. It was in Queen Anne&rsquo;s time that the bone was in its\\r\\n      glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those ancient\\r\\n      dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as you may say;\\r\\n      even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly\\r\\n      under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a tent spread over\\r\\n      the same bone.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and, standing\\r\\n      in the Right Whale&rsquo;s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all these\\r\\n      colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not think you\\r\\n      were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its thousand\\r\\n      pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest Turkey&mdash;the\\r\\n      tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the mouth. It is very\\r\\n      fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck. This\\r\\n      particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I should say it was a\\r\\n      six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that amount of oil.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with&mdash;that\\r\\n      the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads.\\r\\n      To sum up, then: in the Right Whale&rsquo;s there is no great well of sperm; no\\r\\n      ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible of a lower jaw, like the\\r\\n      Sperm Whale&rsquo;s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of\\r\\n      bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a tongue. Again, the\\r\\n      Right Whale has two external spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet lie\\r\\n      together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other will\\r\\n      not be very long in following.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale&rsquo;s there? It is the same he\\r\\n      died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded\\r\\n      away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like placidity, born\\r\\n      of a speculative indifference as to death. But mark the other head&rsquo;s\\r\\n      expression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by accident against the\\r\\n      vessel&rsquo;s side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw. Does not this whole head\\r\\n      seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death? This\\r\\n      Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who\\r\\n      might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0076\" id=\"link2HCH0076\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 76. The Battering-Ram.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale&rsquo;s head, I would have you, as\\r\\n      a sensible physiologist, simply&mdash;particularly remark its front\\r\\n      aspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you investigate\\r\\n      it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated,\\r\\n      intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may be lodged there.\\r\\n      Here is a vital point; for you must either satisfactorily settle this\\r\\n      matter with yourself, or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most\\r\\n      appalling, but not the less true events, perhaps anywhere to be found in\\r\\n      all recorded history.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale, the\\r\\n      front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water;\\r\\n      you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably\\r\\n      backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which\\r\\n      receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the mouth is entirely\\r\\n      under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as though your own mouth\\r\\n      were entirely under your chin. Moreover you observe that the whale has no\\r\\n      external nose; and that what nose he has&mdash;his spout hole&mdash;is on\\r\\n      the top of his head; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides\\r\\n      of his head, nearly one third of his entire length from the front.\\r\\n      Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whale&rsquo;s\\r\\n      head is a dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender prominence of\\r\\n      any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are now to consider that only in the\\r\\n      extreme, lower, backward sloping part of the front of the head, is there\\r\\n      the slightest vestige of bone; and not till you get near twenty feet from\\r\\n      the forehead do you come to the full cranial development. So that this\\r\\n      whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad. Finally, though, as will soon\\r\\n      be revealed, its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you\\r\\n      are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably\\r\\n      invests all that apparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have\\r\\n      described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind\\r\\n      wraps an orange. Just so with the head; but with this difference: about\\r\\n      the head this envelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toughness,\\r\\n      inestimable by any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed\\r\\n      harpoon, the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently\\r\\n      rebounds from it. It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were\\r\\n      paved with horses&rsquo; hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen\\r\\n      chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the\\r\\n      sailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming\\r\\n      contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold there\\r\\n      a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and toughest\\r\\n      of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have\\r\\n      snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By itself this\\r\\n      sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at. But supplementary to\\r\\n      this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as ordinary fish possess\\r\\n      what is called a swimming bladder in them, capable, at will, of distension\\r\\n      or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I know, has no such\\r\\n      provision in him; considering, too, the otherwise inexplicable manner in\\r\\n      which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface, and anon\\r\\n      swims with it high elevated out of the water; considering the unobstructed\\r\\n      elasticity of its envelope; considering the unique interior of his head;\\r\\n      it has hypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those mystical\\r\\n      lung-celled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and\\r\\n      unsuspected connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to\\r\\n      atmospheric distension and contraction. If this be so, fancy the\\r\\n      irresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and\\r\\n      destructive of all elements contributes.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable wall,\\r\\n      and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a mass of\\r\\n      tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is&mdash;by\\r\\n      the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the smallest insect. So\\r\\n      that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and\\r\\n      concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster;\\r\\n      when I shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats; I\\r\\n      trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity, and be ready to\\r\\n      abide by this; that though the Sperm Whale stove a passage through the\\r\\n      Isthmus of Darien, and mixed the Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not\\r\\n      elevate one hair of your eye-brow. For unless you own the whale, you are\\r\\n      but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth. But clear Truth is a thing\\r\\n      for salamander giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the\\r\\n      provincials then? What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread\\r\\n      goddess&rsquo;s veil at Lais?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0077\" id=\"link2HCH0077\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 77. The Great Heidelburgh Tun.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it aright, you must\\r\\n      know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated\\r\\n      upon.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Regarding the Sperm Whale&rsquo;s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an\\r\\n      inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower is\\r\\n      the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an\\r\\n      unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the\\r\\n      expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the\\r\\n      forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two\\r\\n      almost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal\\r\\n      wall of a thick tendinous substance.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      *Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical\\r\\n      mathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a\\r\\n      solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the\\r\\n      steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both\\r\\n      sides.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of\\r\\n      oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand infiltrated\\r\\n      cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent. The\\r\\n      upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh\\r\\n      Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is mystically\\r\\n      carved in front, so the whale&rsquo;s vast plaited forehead forms innumerable\\r\\n      strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun.\\r\\n      Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished with the most\\r\\n      excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun of the whale\\r\\n      contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages; namely, the\\r\\n      highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous\\r\\n      state. Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of\\r\\n      the creature. Though in life it remains perfectly fluid, yet, upon\\r\\n      exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete; sending\\r\\n      forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the first thin delicate ice is\\r\\n      just forming in water. A large whale&rsquo;s case generally yields about five\\r\\n      hundred gallons of sperm, though from unavoidable circumstances,\\r\\n      considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles away, or is otherwise\\r\\n      irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was\\r\\n      coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly\\r\\n      have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like the lining of\\r\\n      a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale&rsquo;s case.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale\\r\\n      embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since&mdash;as\\r\\n      has been elsewhere set forth&mdash;the head embraces one third of the\\r\\n      whole length of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet\\r\\n      for a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the depth\\r\\n      of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship&rsquo;s\\r\\n      side.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As in decapitating the whale, the operator&rsquo;s instrument is brought close\\r\\n      to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti\\r\\n      magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest a careless,\\r\\n      untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its\\r\\n      invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the head, also, which\\r\\n      is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in that position by the\\r\\n      enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen combinations, on one side, make\\r\\n      quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and&mdash;in\\r\\n      this particular instance&mdash;almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm\\r\\n      Whale&rsquo;s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0078\" id=\"link2HCH0078\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 78. Cistern and Buckets.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect\\r\\n      posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the part\\r\\n      where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried with him a\\r\\n      light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts, travelling\\r\\n      through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that it hangs down\\r\\n      from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it is caught and\\r\\n      firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down the other part,\\r\\n      the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he lands on the summit\\r\\n      of the head. There&mdash;still high elevated above the rest of the\\r\\n      company, to whom he vivaciously cries&mdash;he seems some Turkish Muezzin\\r\\n      calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A\\r\\n      short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches for\\r\\n      the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business he\\r\\n      proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,\\r\\n      sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time this\\r\\n      cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like a\\r\\n      well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the other\\r\\n      end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or three alert\\r\\n      hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian, to whom\\r\\n      another person has reached up a very long pole. Inserting this pole into\\r\\n      the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun, till it\\r\\n      entirely disappears; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip, up\\r\\n      comes the bucket again, all bubbling like a dairy-maid&rsquo;s pail of new milk.\\r\\n      Carefully lowered from its height, the full-freighted vessel is caught by\\r\\n      an appointed hand, and quickly emptied into a large tub. Then remounting\\r\\n      aloft, it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will\\r\\n      yield no more. Towards the end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder\\r\\n      and harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of\\r\\n      the pole have gone down.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;\\r\\n      several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once a\\r\\n      queer accident happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild Indian,\\r\\n      was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed hold\\r\\n      on the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or whether the place\\r\\n      where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or whether the Evil One\\r\\n      himself would have it to fall out so, without stating his particular\\r\\n      reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling now; but, on a sudden, as\\r\\n      the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up&mdash;my God! poor\\r\\n      Tashtego&mdash;like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well,\\r\\n      dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh, and with a\\r\\n      horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of sight!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Man overboard!&rdquo; cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first\\r\\n      came to his senses. &ldquo;Swing the bucket this way!&rdquo; and putting one foot into\\r\\n      it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip itself,\\r\\n      the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost before\\r\\n      Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime, there was a\\r\\n      terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before lifeless head\\r\\n      throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea, as if that moment\\r\\n      seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only the poor Indian\\r\\n      unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he\\r\\n      had sunk.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing the\\r\\n      whip&mdash;which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles&mdash;a\\r\\n      sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all, one\\r\\n      of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a vast\\r\\n      vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship reeled and\\r\\n      shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook, upon which the\\r\\n      entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be on the point of\\r\\n      giving way; an event still more likely from the violent motions of the\\r\\n      head.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Come down, come down!&rdquo; yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand\\r\\n      holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he would\\r\\n      still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line, rammed\\r\\n      down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the buried\\r\\n      harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;In heaven&rsquo;s name, man,&rdquo; cried Stubb, &ldquo;are you ramming home a cartridge\\r\\n      there?&mdash;Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket\\r\\n      on top of his head? Avast, will ye!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Stand clear of the tackle!&rdquo; cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass dropped\\r\\n      into the sea, like Niagara&rsquo;s Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the suddenly\\r\\n      relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering copper; and\\r\\n      all caught their breath, as half swinging&mdash;now over the sailors&rsquo;\\r\\n      heads, and now over the water&mdash;Daggoo, through a thick mist of spray,\\r\\n      was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,\\r\\n      buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea!\\r\\n      But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a naked figure with\\r\\n      a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen hovering over\\r\\n      the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my brave Queequeg had\\r\\n      dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the side, and every eye\\r\\n      counted every ripple, as moment followed moment, and no sign of either the\\r\\n      sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands now jumped into a boat\\r\\n      alongside, and pushed a little off from the ship.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch\\r\\n      overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust\\r\\n      upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust\\r\\n      forth from the grass over a grave.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Both! both!&mdash;it is both!&rdquo;&mdash;cried Daggoo again with a joyful\\r\\n      shout; and soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one\\r\\n      hand, and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into\\r\\n      the waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was\\r\\n      long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the\\r\\n      slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges\\r\\n      near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then dropping his\\r\\n      sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards, and so hauled out\\r\\n      poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first thrusting in for him, a\\r\\n      leg was presented; but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be,\\r\\n      and might occasion great trouble;&mdash;he had thrust back the leg, and by\\r\\n      a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so\\r\\n      that with the next trial, he came forth in the good old way&mdash;head\\r\\n      foremost. As for the great head itself, that was doing as well as could be\\r\\n      expected.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg,\\r\\n      the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was successfully\\r\\n      accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and apparently\\r\\n      hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten.\\r\\n      Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing,\\r\\n      riding and rowing.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header&rsquo;s will be sure to seem\\r\\n      incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have either seen\\r\\n      or heard of some one&rsquo;s falling into a cistern ashore; an accident which\\r\\n      not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than the Indian&rsquo;s,\\r\\n      considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whale&rsquo;s\\r\\n      well.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought\\r\\n      the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and\\r\\n      most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a\\r\\n      far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at all,\\r\\n      but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had been nearly\\r\\n      emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the dense tendinous\\r\\n      wall of the well&mdash;a double welded, hammered substance, as I have\\r\\n      before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of which sinks in\\r\\n      it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance\\r\\n      was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of\\r\\n      the head remaining undetached from it, so that it sank very slowly and\\r\\n      deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing his\\r\\n      agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say. Yes, it was a running\\r\\n      delivery, so it was.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious\\r\\n      perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant\\r\\n      spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber and\\r\\n      sanctum sanctorum of the whale. Only one sweeter end can readily be\\r\\n      recalled&mdash;the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking\\r\\n      honey in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it,\\r\\n      that leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed. How\\r\\n      many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato&rsquo;s honey head, and sweetly\\r\\n      perished there?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0079\" id=\"link2HCH0079\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 79. The Prairie.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this\\r\\n      Leviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as\\r\\n      yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for\\r\\n      Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar, or for\\r\\n      Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the Pantheon.\\r\\n      Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats of the various\\r\\n      faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces of horses, birds,\\r\\n      serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the modifications of\\r\\n      expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim\\r\\n      failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics\\r\\n      of other beings than man. Therefore, though I am but ill qualified for a\\r\\n      pioneer, in the application of these two semi-sciences to the whale, I\\r\\n      will do my endeavor. I try all things; I achieve what I can.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He\\r\\n      has no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous\\r\\n      of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls\\r\\n      their combined expression; hence it would seem that its entire absence, as\\r\\n      an external appendage, must very largely affect the countenance of the\\r\\n      whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire, cupola, monument, or tower\\r\\n      of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the\\r\\n      scene; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated\\r\\n      open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the nose from Phidias&rsquo;s marble Jove,\\r\\n      and what a sorry remainder! Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a\\r\\n      magnitude, all his proportions are so stately, that the same deficiency\\r\\n      which in the sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all.\\r\\n      Nay, it is an added grandeur. A nose to the whale would have been\\r\\n      impertinent. As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head\\r\\n      in your jolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by\\r\\n      the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which\\r\\n      so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest\\r\\n      royal beadle on his throne.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be\\r\\n      had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This aspect\\r\\n      is sublime.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the\\r\\n      morning. In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has a\\r\\n      touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles, the\\r\\n      elephant&rsquo;s brow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is as that\\r\\n      great golden seal affixed by the German emperors to their decrees. It\\r\\n      signifies&mdash;&ldquo;God: done this day by my hand.&rdquo; But in most creatures,\\r\\n      nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land\\r\\n      lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which like Shakespeare&rsquo;s\\r\\n      or Melancthon&rsquo;s rise so high, and descend so low, that the eyes themselves\\r\\n      seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes; and all above them in the\\r\\n      forehead&rsquo;s wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending\\r\\n      there to drink, as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer.\\r\\n      But in the great Sperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like dignity\\r\\n      inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified, that gazing on it, in that\\r\\n      full front view, you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly\\r\\n      than in beholding any other object in living nature. For you see no one\\r\\n      point precisely; not one distinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes,\\r\\n      ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper; nothing but that one broad\\r\\n      firmament of a forehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the\\r\\n      doom of boats, and ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous\\r\\n      brow diminish; though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon\\r\\n      you so. In profile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic\\r\\n      depression in the forehead&rsquo;s middle, which, in man, is Lavater&rsquo;s mark of\\r\\n      genius.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a\\r\\n      book, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing\\r\\n      nothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his pyramidical\\r\\n      silence. And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to\\r\\n      the young Orient World, he would have been deified by their child-magian\\r\\n      thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile, because the crocodile is\\r\\n      tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue, or at least it is so\\r\\n      exceedingly small, as to be incapable of protrusion. If hereafter any\\r\\n      highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure back to their birth-right, the\\r\\n      merry May-day gods of old; and livingly enthrone them again in the now\\r\\n      egotistical sky; in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to\\r\\n      Jove&rsquo;s high seat, the great Sperm Whale shall lord it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is no\\r\\n      Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man&rsquo;s and every being&rsquo;s face.\\r\\n      Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing fable. If\\r\\n      then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could not read the\\r\\n      simplest peasant&rsquo;s face in its profounder and more subtle meanings, how\\r\\n      may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale&rsquo;s\\r\\n      brow? I but put that brow before you. Read it if you can.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0080\" id=\"link2HCH0080\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 80. The Nut.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist his\\r\\n      brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in\\r\\n      length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as the\\r\\n      side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base.\\r\\n      But in life&mdash;as we have elsewhere seen&mdash;this inclined plane is\\r\\n      angularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent\\r\\n      mass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to\\r\\n      bed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this crater&mdash;in\\r\\n      another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth&mdash;reposes\\r\\n      the mere handful of this monster&rsquo;s brain. The brain is at least twenty\\r\\n      feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away behind its vast\\r\\n      outworks, like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications\\r\\n      of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it secreted in him, that I have\\r\\n      known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any\\r\\n      other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic-yards\\r\\n      of his sperm magazine. Lying in strange folds, courses, and convolutions,\\r\\n      to their apprehensions, it seems more in keeping with the idea of his\\r\\n      general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his\\r\\n      intelligence.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in the\\r\\n      creature&rsquo;s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his true\\r\\n      brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The whale,\\r\\n      like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the common world.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of\\r\\n      its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its resemblance\\r\\n      to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from the same point\\r\\n      of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down to the human\\r\\n      magnitude) among a plate of men&rsquo;s skulls, and you would involuntarily\\r\\n      confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on one part of its\\r\\n      summit, in phrenological phrase you would say&mdash;This man had no\\r\\n      self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations, considered along\\r\\n      with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power, you can best\\r\\n      form to yourself the truest, though not the most exhilarating conception\\r\\n      of what the most exalted potency is.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale&rsquo;s proper brain, you\\r\\n      deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea\\r\\n      for you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped&rsquo;s spine, you will\\r\\n      be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrÃ¦ to a strung necklace of\\r\\n      dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper. It\\r\\n      is a German conceit, that the vertebrÃ¦ are absolutely undeveloped skulls.\\r\\n      But the curious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the\\r\\n      first men to perceive. A foreign friend once pointed it out to me, in the\\r\\n      skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebrÃ¦ of which he was\\r\\n      inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I\\r\\n      consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not\\r\\n      pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal.\\r\\n      For I believe that much of a man&rsquo;s character will be found betokened in\\r\\n      his backbone. I would rather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you\\r\\n      are. A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul. I\\r\\n      rejoice in my spine, as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I\\r\\n      fling half out to the world.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial\\r\\n      cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra\\r\\n      the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being eight\\r\\n      in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As it\\r\\n      passes through the remaining vertebrÃ¦ the canal tapers in size, but for a\\r\\n      considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course, this\\r\\n      canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance&mdash;the\\r\\n      spinal cord&mdash;as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain.\\r\\n      And what is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain&rsquo;s\\r\\n      cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to\\r\\n      that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable\\r\\n      to survey and map out the whale&rsquo;s spine phrenologically? For, viewed in\\r\\n      this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is\\r\\n      more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal\\r\\n      cord.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I would\\r\\n      merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the Sperm\\r\\n      Whale&rsquo;s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one of the\\r\\n      larger vertebrÃ¦, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer convex mould\\r\\n      of it. From its relative situation then, I should call this high hump the\\r\\n      organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale. And that the\\r\\n      great monster is indomitable, you will yet have reason to know.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0081\" id=\"link2HCH0081\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 81. The Pequod Meets The Virgin.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau, Derick\\r\\n      De Deer, master, of Bremen.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and\\r\\n      Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide intervals\\r\\n      of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with their flag in\\r\\n      the Pacific.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.\\r\\n      While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a\\r\\n      boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the\\r\\n      bows instead of the stern.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What has he in his hand there?&rdquo; cried Starbuck, pointing to something\\r\\n      wavingly held by the German. &ldquo;Impossible!&mdash;a lamp-feeder!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Not that,&rdquo; said Stubb, &ldquo;no, no, it&rsquo;s a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he&rsquo;s\\r\\n      coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don&rsquo;t you see that big\\r\\n      tin can there alongside of him?&mdash;that&rsquo;s his boiling water. Oh! he&rsquo;s\\r\\n      all right, is the Yarman.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Go along with you,&rdquo; cried Flask, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a lamp-feeder and an oil-can. He&rsquo;s\\r\\n      out of oil, and has come a-begging.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the\\r\\n      whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old\\r\\n      proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing\\r\\n      really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did\\r\\n      indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all heeding\\r\\n      what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German soon evinced\\r\\n      his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately turning the\\r\\n      conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some remarks touching\\r\\n      his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness&mdash;his\\r\\n      last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a single flying-fish yet\\r\\n      captured to supply the deficiency; concluding by hinting that his ship was\\r\\n      indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a <i>clean</i> one (that is, an\\r\\n      empty one), well deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his\\r\\n      ship&rsquo;s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the\\r\\n      mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that\\r\\n      without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed round\\r\\n      his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German boats\\r\\n      that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the Pequod&rsquo;s keels.\\r\\n      There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their danger, they were\\r\\n      going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind, rubbing their\\r\\n      flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness. They left a\\r\\n      great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment\\r\\n      upon the sea.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge, humped\\r\\n      old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as by the\\r\\n      unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed afflicted with the\\r\\n      jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this whale belonged to the pod\\r\\n      in advance, seemed questionable; for it is not customary for such\\r\\n      venerable leviathans to be at all social. Nevertheless, he stuck to their\\r\\n      wake, though indeed their back water must have retarded him, because the\\r\\n      white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell\\r\\n      formed when two hostile currents meet. His spout was short, slow, and\\r\\n      laborious; coming forth with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself\\r\\n      in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which\\r\\n      seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters\\r\\n      behind him to upbubble.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s got some paregoric?&rdquo; said Stubb, &ldquo;he has the stomach-ache, I&rsquo;m\\r\\n      afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse winds\\r\\n      are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It&rsquo;s the first foul wind I ever\\r\\n      knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so before? it must\\r\\n      be, he&rsquo;s lost his tiller.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load\\r\\n      of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her way; so\\r\\n      did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly turning\\r\\n      over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious wake in the\\r\\n      unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost that fin in\\r\\n      battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Only wait a bit, old chap, and I&rsquo;ll give ye a sling for that wounded\\r\\n      arm,&rdquo; cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Mind he don&rsquo;t sling thee with it,&rdquo; cried Starbuck. &ldquo;Give way, or the\\r\\n      German will have him.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one\\r\\n      fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most valuable\\r\\n      whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were going with\\r\\n      such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for the time. At\\r\\n      this juncture the Pequod&rsquo;s keels had shot by the three German boats last\\r\\n      lowered; but from the great start he had had, Derick&rsquo;s boat still led the\\r\\n      chase, though every moment neared by his foreign rivals. The only thing\\r\\n      they feared, was, that from being already so nigh to his mark, he would be\\r\\n      enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass\\r\\n      him. As for Derick, he seemed quite confident that this would be the case,\\r\\n      and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the\\r\\n      other boats.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The ungracious and ungrateful dog!&rdquo; cried Starbuck; &ldquo;he mocks and dares\\r\\n      me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes ago!&rdquo;&mdash;then\\r\\n      in his old intense whisper&mdash;&ldquo;Give way, greyhounds! Dog to it!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I tell ye what it is, men&rdquo;&mdash;cried Stubb to his crew&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s\\r\\n      against my religion to get mad; but I&rsquo;d like to eat that villainous Yarman&mdash;Pull&mdash;won&rsquo;t\\r\\n      ye? Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye? Do ye love brandy? A hogshead\\r\\n      of brandy, then, to the best man. Come, why don&rsquo;t some of ye burst a\\r\\n      blood-vessel? Who&rsquo;s that been dropping an anchor overboard&mdash;we don&rsquo;t\\r\\n      budge an inch&mdash;we&rsquo;re becalmed. Halloo, here&rsquo;s grass growing in the\\r\\n      boat&rsquo;s bottom&mdash;and by the Lord, the mast there&rsquo;s budding. This won&rsquo;t\\r\\n      do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The short and long of it is, men, will ye\\r\\n      spit fire or not?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oh! see the suds he makes!&rdquo; cried Flask, dancing up and down&mdash;&ldquo;What\\r\\n      a hump&mdash;Oh, <i>do</i> pile on the beef&mdash;lays like a log! Oh! my lads,\\r\\n      <i>do</i> spring&mdash;slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads&mdash;baked\\r\\n      clams and muffins&mdash;oh, <i>do</i>, <i>do</i>, spring,&mdash;he&rsquo;s a hundred barreller&mdash;don&rsquo;t\\r\\n      lose him now&mdash;don&rsquo;t oh, <i>don&rsquo;t!</i>&mdash;see that Yarman&mdash;Oh, won&rsquo;t\\r\\n      ye pull for your duff, my lads&mdash;such a sog! such a sogger! Don&rsquo;t ye\\r\\n      love sperm? There goes three thousand dollars, men!&mdash;a bank!&mdash;a\\r\\n      whole bank! The bank of England!&mdash;Oh, <i>do</i>, <i>do</i>, <i>do!</i>&mdash;What&rsquo;s that\\r\\n      Yarman about now?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the\\r\\n      advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view of\\r\\n      retarding his rivals&rsquo; way, and at the same time economically accelerating\\r\\n      his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The unmannerly Dutch dogger!&rdquo; cried Stubb. &ldquo;Pull now, men, like fifty\\r\\n      thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils. What d&rsquo;ye say,\\r\\n      Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces for\\r\\n      the honor of old Gayhead? What d&rsquo;ye say?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I say, pull like god-dam,&rdquo;&mdash;cried the Indian.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod&rsquo;s\\r\\n      three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,\\r\\n      momentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the\\r\\n      headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up proudly,\\r\\n      occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of, &ldquo;There\\r\\n      she slides, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down with the Yarman!\\r\\n      Sail over him!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all their\\r\\n      gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not a\\r\\n      righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of\\r\\n      his midship oarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to free his\\r\\n      white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick&rsquo;s boat was nigh to capsizing,\\r\\n      and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;&mdash;that was a good\\r\\n      time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took a mortal\\r\\n      start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German&rsquo;s quarter. An\\r\\n      instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the whale&rsquo;s\\r\\n      immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was the foaming\\r\\n      swell that he made.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was now\\r\\n      going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented\\r\\n      jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright. Now to\\r\\n      this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering flight, and still at\\r\\n      every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank in the sea, or sideways\\r\\n      rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So have I seen a bird with\\r\\n      clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air, vainly striving\\r\\n      to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird has a voice, and with\\r\\n      plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb\\r\\n      brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice,\\r\\n      save that choking respiration through his spiracle, and this made the\\r\\n      sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk,\\r\\n      portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the\\r\\n      stoutest man who so pitied.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod&rsquo;s boats\\r\\n      the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick chose to\\r\\n      hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart, ere the\\r\\n      last chance would for ever escape.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three\\r\\n      tigers&mdash;Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo&mdash;instinctively sprang to\\r\\n      their feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their\\r\\n      barbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three\\r\\n      Nantucket irons entered the whale. Blinding vapors of foam and\\r\\n      white-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whale&rsquo;s headlong\\r\\n      rush, bumped the German&rsquo;s aside with such force, that both Derick and his\\r\\n      baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three flying\\r\\n      keels.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, my butter-boxes,&rdquo; cried Stubb, casting a passing glance\\r\\n      upon them as he shot by; &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll be picked up presently&mdash;all right&mdash;I\\r\\n      saw some sharks astern&mdash;St. Bernard&rsquo;s dogs, you know&mdash;relieve\\r\\n      distressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel a\\r\\n      sunbeam! Hurrah!&mdash;Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a\\r\\n      mad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury\\r\\n      on a plain&mdash;makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to him\\r\\n      that way; and there&rsquo;s danger of being pitched out too, when you strike a\\r\\n      hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he&rsquo;s going to Davy Jones&mdash;all\\r\\n      a rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this whale carries the\\r\\n      everlasting mail!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But the monster&rsquo;s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he\\r\\n      tumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round the\\r\\n      loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them; while so\\r\\n      fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust\\r\\n      the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they caught repeated\\r\\n      smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at last&mdash;owing to the\\r\\n      perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of the boats, whence the\\r\\n      three ropes went straight down into the blue&mdash;the gunwales of the\\r\\n      bows were almost even with the water, while the three sterns tilted high\\r\\n      in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for some time they\\r\\n      remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more line, though the\\r\\n      position was a little ticklish. But though boats have been taken down and\\r\\n      lost in this way, yet it is this &ldquo;holding on,&rdquo; as it is called; this\\r\\n      hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is\\r\\n      that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp\\r\\n      lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be\\r\\n      doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but reasonable\\r\\n      to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under water, the more\\r\\n      he is exhausted. Because, owing to the enormous surface of him&mdash;in a\\r\\n      full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet&mdash;the\\r\\n      pressure of the water is immense. We all know what an astonishing\\r\\n      atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground,\\r\\n      in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a\\r\\n      column of two hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the weight\\r\\n      of fifty atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of\\r\\n      twenty line-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on\\r\\n      board.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down into\\r\\n      its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any sort, nay,\\r\\n      not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths; what landsman\\r\\n      would have thought, that beneath all that silence and placidity, the\\r\\n      utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony! Not eight\\r\\n      inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows. Seems it credible\\r\\n      that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the\\r\\n      big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and to what? To three bits of\\r\\n      board. Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said&mdash;&ldquo;Canst\\r\\n      thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears? The\\r\\n      sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold, the spear, the dart, nor the\\r\\n      habergeon: he esteemeth iron as straw; the arrow cannot make him flee;\\r\\n      darts are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of a spear!&rdquo; This\\r\\n      the creature? this he? Oh! that unfulfilments should follow the prophets.\\r\\n      For with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run\\r\\n      his head under the mountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod&rsquo;s\\r\\n      fish-spears!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats sent\\r\\n      down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad enough to\\r\\n      shade half Xerxes&rsquo; army. Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale\\r\\n      must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Stand by, men; he stirs,&rdquo; cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly\\r\\n      vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by\\r\\n      magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every\\r\\n      oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part\\r\\n      from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce\\r\\n      upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are\\r\\n      scared from it into the sea.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Haul in! Haul in!&rdquo; cried Starbuck again; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s rising.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand&rsquo;s breadth\\r\\n      could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all\\r\\n      dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two ship&rsquo;s\\r\\n      lengths of the hunters.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals\\r\\n      there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby\\r\\n      when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in\\r\\n      certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities it\\r\\n      is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels, so that\\r\\n      when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at\\r\\n      once begun upon his whole arterial system; and when this is heightened by\\r\\n      the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface,\\r\\n      his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is\\r\\n      the quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior\\r\\n      fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable\\r\\n      period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the\\r\\n      well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats\\r\\n      pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and\\r\\n      the lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from\\r\\n      the new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural\\r\\n      spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending its\\r\\n      affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet came,\\r\\n      because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life, as they\\r\\n      significantly call it, was untouched.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of his\\r\\n      form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly revealed.\\r\\n      His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were beheld. As\\r\\n      strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when\\r\\n      prostrate, so from the points which the whale&rsquo;s eyes had once occupied,\\r\\n      now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see. But pity there was\\r\\n      none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his blind eyes, he must\\r\\n      die the death and be murdered, in order to light the gay bridals and other\\r\\n      merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate the solemn churches that\\r\\n      preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all. Still rolling in his\\r\\n      blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or\\r\\n      protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;A nice spot,&rdquo; cried Flask; &ldquo;just let me prick him there once.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Avast!&rdquo; cried Starbuck, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no need of that!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an ulcerous\\r\\n      jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than sufferable\\r\\n      anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury blindly\\r\\n      darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying crews all over\\r\\n      with showers of gore, capsizing Flask&rsquo;s boat and marring the bows. It was\\r\\n      his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he by loss of blood,\\r\\n      that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made; lay panting on\\r\\n      his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin, then over and over\\r\\n      slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the white secrets of his\\r\\n      belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most piteous, that last expiring\\r\\n      spout. As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some\\r\\n      mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the\\r\\n      spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground&mdash;so the last long dying\\r\\n      spout of the whale.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body\\r\\n      showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled. Immediately,\\r\\n      by Starbuck&rsquo;s orders, lines were secured to it at different points, so\\r\\n      that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken whale being suspended a\\r\\n      few inches beneath them by the cords. By very heedful management, when the\\r\\n      ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred to her side, and was strongly\\r\\n      secured there by the stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless\\r\\n      artificially upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade, the\\r\\n      entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh, on\\r\\n      the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the stumps of\\r\\n      harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales, with\\r\\n      the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence of any kind to\\r\\n      denote their place; therefore, there must needs have been some other\\r\\n      unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration\\r\\n      alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a lance-head of stone\\r\\n      being found in him, not far from the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm\\r\\n      about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And when? It might have been\\r\\n      darted by some Nor&rsquo; West Indian long before America was discovered.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet\\r\\n      there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further discoveries, by\\r\\n      the ship&rsquo;s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea, owing\\r\\n      to the body&rsquo;s immensely increasing tendency to sink. However, Starbuck,\\r\\n      who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it\\r\\n      so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the ship would have been\\r\\n      capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when\\r\\n      the command was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable\\r\\n      strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables were\\r\\n      fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off. Meantime everything in\\r\\n      the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the other side of the deck was like\\r\\n      walking up the steep gabled roof of a house. The ship groaned and gasped.\\r\\n      Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from\\r\\n      their places, by the unnatural dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows\\r\\n      were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift\\r\\n      from the timberheads; and so low had the whale now settled that the\\r\\n      submerged ends could not be at all approached, while every moment whole\\r\\n      tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed\\r\\n      on the point of going over.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Hold on, hold on, won&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo; cried Stubb to the body, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be in such a\\r\\n      devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something or go for\\r\\n      it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes, and run one of\\r\\n      ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Knife? Aye, aye,&rdquo; cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter&rsquo;s heavy\\r\\n      hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing at\\r\\n      the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were given,\\r\\n      when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific snap, every\\r\\n      fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale\\r\\n      is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted\\r\\n      for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy, with its\\r\\n      side or belly considerably elevated above the surface. If the only whales\\r\\n      that thus sank were old, meagre, and broken-hearted creatures, their pads\\r\\n      of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might\\r\\n      with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon\\r\\n      specific gravity in the fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of\\r\\n      buoyant matter in him. But it is not so. For young whales, in the highest\\r\\n      health, and swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the\\r\\n      warm flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them; even\\r\\n      these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this\\r\\n      accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty\\r\\n      Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in\\r\\n      no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale; his\\r\\n      Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this\\r\\n      incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances where,\\r\\n      after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale again\\r\\n      rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this is obvious. Gases\\r\\n      are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort\\r\\n      of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then.\\r\\n      In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand, when a\\r\\n      Right Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty\\r\\n      of rope; so that when the body has gone down, they know where to look for\\r\\n      it when it shall have ascended again.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from\\r\\n      the Pequod&rsquo;s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering\\r\\n      her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back,\\r\\n      belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of its incredible\\r\\n      power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back&rsquo;s spout is so similar to the\\r\\n      Sperm Whale&rsquo;s, that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it.\\r\\n      And consequently Derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this\\r\\n      unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all sail, made after her four young\\r\\n      keels, and thus they all disappeared far to leeward, still in bold,\\r\\n      hopeful chase.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0082\" id=\"link2HCH0082\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 82. The Honor and Glory of Whaling.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true\\r\\n      method.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up to\\r\\n      the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its great\\r\\n      honorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many great\\r\\n      demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other have\\r\\n      shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection that I\\r\\n      myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a fraternity.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to the\\r\\n      eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale attacked by\\r\\n      our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent. Those were the\\r\\n      knightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms to succor the\\r\\n      distressed, and not to fill men&rsquo;s lamp-feeders. Every one knows the fine\\r\\n      story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely Andromeda, the daughter of\\r\\n      a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast, and as Leviathan was in the\\r\\n      very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the prince of whalemen, intrepidly\\r\\n      advancing, harpooned the monster, and delivered and married the maid. It\\r\\n      was an admirable artistic exploit, rarely achieved by the best harpooneers\\r\\n      of the present day; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first\\r\\n      dart. And let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa,\\r\\n      now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the Pagan temples, there stood\\r\\n      for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which the city&rsquo;s legends and\\r\\n      all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that\\r\\n      Perseus slew. When the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to\\r\\n      Italy in triumph. What seems most singular and suggestively important in\\r\\n      this story, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda&mdash;indeed, by some\\r\\n      supposed to be indirectly derived from it&mdash;is that famous story of\\r\\n      St. George and the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale;\\r\\n      for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled\\r\\n      together, and often stand for each other. &ldquo;Thou art as a lion of the\\r\\n      waters, and as a dragon of the sea,&rdquo; saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly\\r\\n      meaning a whale; in truth, some versions of the Bible use that word\\r\\n      itself. Besides, it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had\\r\\n      St. George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of\\r\\n      doing battle with the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake,\\r\\n      but only a Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to\\r\\n      march boldly up to a whale.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the\\r\\n      creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely\\r\\n      represented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted on\\r\\n      land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance of\\r\\n      those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists; and\\r\\n      considering that as in Perseus&rsquo; case, St. George&rsquo;s whale might have\\r\\n      crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the animal\\r\\n      ridden by St. George might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse;\\r\\n      bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible with\\r\\n      the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to hold this\\r\\n      so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself. In fact,\\r\\n      placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story will fare\\r\\n      like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by name;\\r\\n      who being planted before the ark of Israel, his horse&rsquo;s head and both the\\r\\n      palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or fishy part of\\r\\n      him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble stamp, even a whaleman, is\\r\\n      the tutelary guardian of England; and by good rights, we harpooneers of\\r\\n      Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of St. George. And\\r\\n      therefore, let not the knights of that honorable company (none of whom, I\\r\\n      venture to say, have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron),\\r\\n      let them never eye a Nantucketer with disdain, since even in our woollen\\r\\n      frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to St. George&rsquo;s\\r\\n      decoration than they.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long remained\\r\\n      dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that antique\\r\\n      Crockett and Kit Carson&mdash;that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds,\\r\\n      was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether that strictly\\r\\n      makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere appears that he\\r\\n      ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from the inside.\\r\\n      Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman; at any rate\\r\\n      the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I claim him for one of our\\r\\n      clan.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of Hercules\\r\\n      and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient\\r\\n      Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versÃ¢; certainly they are\\r\\n      very similar. If I claim the demi-god then, why not the prophet?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole\\r\\n      roll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like royal\\r\\n      kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing\\r\\n      short of the great gods themselves. That wondrous oriental story is now to\\r\\n      be rehearsed from the Shaster, which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of\\r\\n      the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine\\r\\n      Vishnoo himself for our Lord;&mdash;Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten\\r\\n      earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale.\\r\\n      When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved to recreate\\r\\n      the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to\\r\\n      Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical books, whose\\r\\n      perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before beginning\\r\\n      the creation, and which therefore must have contained something in the\\r\\n      shape of practical hints to young architects, these Vedas were lying at\\r\\n      the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became incarnate in a whale, and\\r\\n      sounding down in him to the uttermost depths, rescued the sacred volumes.\\r\\n      Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even as a man who rides a horse is\\r\\n      called a horseman?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there&rsquo;s a member-roll\\r\\n      for you! What club but the whaleman&rsquo;s can head off like that?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0083\" id=\"link2HCH0083\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 83. Jonah Historically Regarded.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the\\r\\n      preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical\\r\\n      story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks\\r\\n      and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times,\\r\\n      equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale, and Arion and the\\r\\n      dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those\\r\\n      traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      One old Sag-Harbor whaleman&rsquo;s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew\\r\\n      story was this:&mdash;He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,\\r\\n      embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented\\r\\n      Jonah&rsquo;s whale with two spouts in his head&mdash;a peculiarity only true\\r\\n      with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the\\r\\n      varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this saying,\\r\\n      &ldquo;A penny roll would choke him&rdquo;; his swallow is so very small. But, to\\r\\n      this, Bishop Jebb&rsquo;s anticipative answer is ready. It is not necessary,\\r\\n      hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale&rsquo;s belly,\\r\\n      but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And this seems\\r\\n      reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right Whale&rsquo;s mouth\\r\\n      would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the\\r\\n      players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow\\r\\n      tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his want\\r\\n      of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in\\r\\n      reference to his incarcerated body and the whale&rsquo;s gastric juices. But\\r\\n      this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist\\r\\n      supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a <i>dead</i>\\r\\n      whale&mdash;even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned\\r\\n      their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has been\\r\\n      divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was thrown\\r\\n      overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his escape to\\r\\n      another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a figure-head; and, I\\r\\n      would add, possibly called &ldquo;The Whale,&rdquo; as some craft are nowadays\\r\\n      christened the &ldquo;Shark,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Gull,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Eagle.&rdquo; Nor have there been\\r\\n      wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the\\r\\n      book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver&mdash;an inflated bag of wind&mdash;which\\r\\n      the endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom. Poor\\r\\n      Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round. But he had still another\\r\\n      reason for his want of faith. It was this, if I remember right: Jonah was\\r\\n      swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and after three days he\\r\\n      was vomited up somewhere within three days&rsquo; journey of Nineveh, a city on\\r\\n      the Tigris, very much more than three days&rsquo; journey across from the\\r\\n      nearest point of the Mediterranean coast. How is that?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that\\r\\n      short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by the way\\r\\n      of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through the\\r\\n      whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up the Persian Gulf\\r\\n      and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the complete\\r\\n      circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of the Tigris\\r\\n      waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any whale to swim\\r\\n      in. Besides, this idea of Jonah&rsquo;s weathering the Cape of Good Hope at so\\r\\n      early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of that great headland\\r\\n      from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and so make modern history\\r\\n      a liar.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his foolish\\r\\n      pride of reason&mdash;a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing that\\r\\n      he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and\\r\\n      the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and abominable,\\r\\n      devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a Portuguese\\r\\n      Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah&rsquo;s going to Nineveh via the Cape\\r\\n      of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general\\r\\n      miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly enlightened Turks\\r\\n      devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah. And some three\\r\\n      centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris&rsquo;s Voyages, speaks of a\\r\\n      Turkish Mosque built in honor of Jonah, in which Mosque was a miraculous\\r\\n      lamp that burnt without any oil.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0084\" id=\"link2HCH0084\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 84. Pitchpoling.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are anointed;\\r\\n      and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an analogous operation\\r\\n      upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it to be doubted that as\\r\\n      such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly be of no contemptible\\r\\n      advantage; considering that oil and water are hostile; that oil is a\\r\\n      sliding thing, and that the object in view is to make the boat slide\\r\\n      bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat, and one morning\\r\\n      not long after the German ship Jungfrau disappeared, took more than\\r\\n      customary pains in that occupation; crawling under its bottom, where it\\r\\n      hung over the side, and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently\\r\\n      seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft&rsquo;s bald keel. He seemed to\\r\\n      be working in obedience to some particular presentiment. Nor did it remain\\r\\n      unwarranted by the event.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to\\r\\n      them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered flight,\\r\\n      as of Cleopatra&rsquo;s barges from Actium.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb&rsquo;s was foremost. By great\\r\\n      exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the\\r\\n      stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal\\r\\n      flight, with added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon the\\r\\n      planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became\\r\\n      imperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose him. But to\\r\\n      haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and furious.\\r\\n      What then remained?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and\\r\\n      countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,\\r\\n      none exceed that fine manÅ\\x93uvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small\\r\\n      sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It is\\r\\n      only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand fact and\\r\\n      feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately\\r\\n      darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme headway.\\r\\n      Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in\\r\\n      length; the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon, and also of a\\r\\n      lighter material&mdash;pine. It is furnished with a small rope called a\\r\\n      warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to the hand\\r\\n      after darting.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But before going further, it is important to mention here, that though the\\r\\n      harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is seldom\\r\\n      done; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on account of\\r\\n      the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the\\r\\n      lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a general thing,\\r\\n      therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before any pitchpoling\\r\\n      comes into play.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and\\r\\n      equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel in\\r\\n      pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the\\r\\n      flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet ahead.\\r\\n      Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along its length\\r\\n      to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of\\r\\n      the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in his grasp, leaving\\r\\n      the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full before his waistband&rsquo;s\\r\\n      middle, he levels it at the whale; when, covering him with it, he steadily\\r\\n      depresses the butt-end in his hand, thereby elevating the point till the\\r\\n      weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm, fifteen feet in the air. He\\r\\n      minds you somewhat of a juggler, balancing a long staff on his chin. Next\\r\\n      moment with a rapid, nameless impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright\\r\\n      steel spans the foaming distance, and quivers in the life spot of the\\r\\n      whale. Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;That drove the spigot out of him!&rdquo; cried Stubb. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis July&rsquo;s immortal\\r\\n      Fourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it were old Orleans\\r\\n      whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then, Tashtego, lad,\\r\\n      I&rsquo;d have ye hold a canakin to the jet, and we&rsquo;d drink round it! Yea,\\r\\n      verily, hearts alive, we&rsquo;d brew choice punch in the spread of his\\r\\n      spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the living stuff.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated, the\\r\\n      spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash. The\\r\\n      agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is slackened, and the\\r\\n      pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and mutely watches the\\r\\n      monster die.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0085\" id=\"link2HCH0085\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      That for six thousand years&mdash;and no one knows how many millions of\\r\\n      ages before&mdash;the great whales should have been spouting all over the\\r\\n      sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so\\r\\n      many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back,\\r\\n      thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale,\\r\\n      watching these sprinklings and spoutings&mdash;that all this should be,\\r\\n      and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter minutes\\r\\n      past one o&rsquo;clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D. 1851), it\\r\\n      should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are, after all,\\r\\n      really water, or nothing but vapor&mdash;this is surely a noteworthy\\r\\n      thing.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items\\r\\n      contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills,\\r\\n      the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined\\r\\n      with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod might live\\r\\n      a century, and never once raise its head above the surface. But owing to\\r\\n      his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs, like a human\\r\\n      being&rsquo;s, the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the\\r\\n      open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the\\r\\n      upper world. But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for,\\r\\n      in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm Whale&rsquo;s mouth is buried at least eight\\r\\n      feet beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no\\r\\n      connexion with his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and\\r\\n      this is on the top of his head.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable\\r\\n      to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element,\\r\\n      which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to\\r\\n      the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I shall err; though I\\r\\n      may possibly use some superfluous scientific words. Assume it, and it\\r\\n      follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath,\\r\\n      he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a\\r\\n      considerable time. That is to say, he would then live without breathing.\\r\\n      Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the whale, who\\r\\n      systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the\\r\\n      bottom) without drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling\\r\\n      a particle of air; for, remember, he has no gills. How is this? Between\\r\\n      his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable\\r\\n      involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when\\r\\n      he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated blood. So\\r\\n      that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a\\r\\n      surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless\\r\\n      desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four\\r\\n      supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is\\r\\n      indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and\\r\\n      true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise\\r\\n      inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in <i>having his spoutings out</i>, as\\r\\n      the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising\\r\\n      to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time\\r\\n      exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven\\r\\n      minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then\\r\\n      whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over\\r\\n      again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him,\\r\\n      so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his\\r\\n      regular allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told,\\r\\n      will he finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however,\\r\\n      that in different individuals these rates are different; but in any one\\r\\n      they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his\\r\\n      spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere\\r\\n      descending for good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the\\r\\n      whale&rsquo;s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For not\\r\\n      by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a\\r\\n      thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O\\r\\n      hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In man, breathing is incessantly going on&mdash;one breath only serving\\r\\n      for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to\\r\\n      attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the\\r\\n      Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if\\r\\n      it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then I\\r\\n      opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems\\r\\n      obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at all answers to\\r\\n      his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so clogged with two\\r\\n      elements, it could not be expected to have the power of smelling. But\\r\\n      owing to the mystery of the spout&mdash;whether it be water or whether it\\r\\n      be vapor&mdash;no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this\\r\\n      head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper\\r\\n      olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no violets, no\\r\\n      Cologne-water in the sea.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting\\r\\n      canal, and as that long canal&mdash;like the grand Erie Canal&mdash;is\\r\\n      furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward\\r\\n      retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has\\r\\n      no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely\\r\\n      rumbles, he talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to\\r\\n      say? Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to\\r\\n      this world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a\\r\\n      living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is for\\r\\n      the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just\\r\\n      beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this\\r\\n      curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side\\r\\n      of a street. But the question returns whether this gas-pipe is also a\\r\\n      water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the\\r\\n      mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed\\r\\n      with water taken in at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle. It\\r\\n      is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal;\\r\\n      but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water\\r\\n      through the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would\\r\\n      seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm\\r\\n      Whale&rsquo;s food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if\\r\\n      he would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your\\r\\n      watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme\\r\\n      between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out! You\\r\\n      have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not tell\\r\\n      water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle\\r\\n      these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of\\r\\n      all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in it, and yet be\\r\\n      undecided as to what it is precisely.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping\\r\\n      it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when,\\r\\n      always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his\\r\\n      spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all around\\r\\n      him. And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops\\r\\n      of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are not merely\\r\\n      condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are not those\\r\\n      identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole fissure, which is\\r\\n      countersunk into the summit of the whale&rsquo;s head? For even when tranquilly\\r\\n      swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with his elevated hump\\r\\n      sun-dried as a dromedary&rsquo;s in the desert; even then, the whale always\\r\\n      carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun you\\r\\n      will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the\\r\\n      precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering\\r\\n      into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to\\r\\n      this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into\\r\\n      slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will often\\r\\n      happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of the thing\\r\\n      so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer contact with\\r\\n      the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or otherwise, I\\r\\n      cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm. Wherefore, among\\r\\n      whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it. Another\\r\\n      thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet\\r\\n      is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you. The wisest thing the\\r\\n      investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly spout\\r\\n      alone.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My\\r\\n      hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides other\\r\\n      reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations touching the\\r\\n      great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I account him no\\r\\n      common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is\\r\\n      never found on soundings, or near shores; all other whales sometimes are.\\r\\n      He is both ponderous and profound. And I am convinced that from the heads\\r\\n      of all ponderous profound beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil,\\r\\n      Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes up a certain semi-visible\\r\\n      steam, while in the act of thinking deep thoughts. While composing a\\r\\n      little treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before\\r\\n      me; and ere long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and\\r\\n      undulation in the atmosphere over my head. The invariable moisture of my\\r\\n      hair, while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin\\r\\n      shingled attic, of an August noon; this seems an additional argument for\\r\\n      the above supposition.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to\\r\\n      behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild\\r\\n      head overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable\\r\\n      contemplations, and that vapor&mdash;as you will sometimes see it&mdash;glorified\\r\\n      by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts. For,\\r\\n      d&rsquo;ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate vapor.\\r\\n      And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind, divine\\r\\n      intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray. And\\r\\n      for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or\\r\\n      denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of all things\\r\\n      earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this combination makes\\r\\n      neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with\\r\\n      equal eye.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0086\" id=\"link2HCH0086\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 86. The Tail.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope, and\\r\\n      the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial, I\\r\\n      celebrate a tail.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale&rsquo;s tail to begin at that point of\\r\\n      the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises upon\\r\\n      its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet. The\\r\\n      compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms or\\r\\n      flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness. At the\\r\\n      crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways recede\\r\\n      from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between. In no living\\r\\n      thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the\\r\\n      crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost expansion in the full\\r\\n      grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut into\\r\\n      it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:&mdash;upper,\\r\\n      middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long and\\r\\n      horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running crosswise\\r\\n      between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as anything\\r\\n      else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman walls, the\\r\\n      middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles\\r\\n      always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the\\r\\n      antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of\\r\\n      the masonry.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough, the\\r\\n      whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular\\r\\n      fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins and running\\r\\n      down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and largely contribute\\r\\n      to their might; so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the\\r\\n      whole whale seems concentrated to a point. Could annihilation occur to\\r\\n      matter, this were the thing to do it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor does this&mdash;its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the\\r\\n      graceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates\\r\\n      through a Titanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their\\r\\n      most appalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or\\r\\n      harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly beautiful,\\r\\n      strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied tendons that\\r\\n      all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved Hercules, and its\\r\\n      charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the\\r\\n      naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the\\r\\n      man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch. When Angelo paints even God\\r\\n      the Father in human form, mark what robustness is there. And whatever they\\r\\n      may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled,\\r\\n      hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most\\r\\n      successfully embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of all\\r\\n      brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative, feminine one\\r\\n      of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is conceded, form the\\r\\n      peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether\\r\\n      wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it be\\r\\n      in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein no\\r\\n      fairy&rsquo;s arm can transcend it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Five great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for\\r\\n      progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping;\\r\\n      Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan&rsquo;s tail acts in a\\r\\n      different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never\\r\\n      wriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the\\r\\n      whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled\\r\\n      forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is this\\r\\n      which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster when\\r\\n      furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only fights\\r\\n      another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his conflicts\\r\\n      with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In striking at a\\r\\n      boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the blow is only\\r\\n      inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed air, especially\\r\\n      if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply irresistible. No ribs\\r\\n      of man or boat can withstand it. Your only salvation lies in eluding it;\\r\\n      but if it comes sideways through the opposing water, then partly owing to\\r\\n      the light buoyancy of the whale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials,\\r\\n      a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is\\r\\n      generally the most serious result. These submerged side blows are so often\\r\\n      received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child&rsquo;s play. Some\\r\\n      one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale the\\r\\n      sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect there is a\\r\\n      delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant&rsquo;s trunk.\\r\\n      This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping, when in\\r\\n      maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his\\r\\n      immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea; and if he\\r\\n      feel but a sailor&rsquo;s whisker, woe to that sailor, whiskers and all. What\\r\\n      tenderness there is in that preliminary touch! Had this tail any\\r\\n      prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of Darmonodes&rsquo; elephant\\r\\n      that so frequented the flower-market, and with low salutations presented\\r\\n      nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their zones. On more accounts than\\r\\n      one, a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue\\r\\n      in his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded\\r\\n      in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the\\r\\n      middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of\\r\\n      his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a\\r\\n      hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of his\\r\\n      tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the\\r\\n      thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a great\\r\\n      gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor\\r\\n      from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that that was\\r\\n      the smoke from the touch-hole.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie\\r\\n      considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely out of\\r\\n      sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into the deeps,\\r\\n      his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect\\r\\n      in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they downwards shoot\\r\\n      out of view. Excepting the sublime <i>breach</i>&mdash;somewhere else to be\\r\\n      described&mdash;this peaking of the whale&rsquo;s flukes is perhaps the grandest\\r\\n      sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless\\r\\n      profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the\\r\\n      highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth\\r\\n      his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in gazing\\r\\n      at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean,\\r\\n      the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels.\\r\\n      Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky\\r\\n      and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east, all heading\\r\\n      towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes.\\r\\n      As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of\\r\\n      the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire\\r\\n      worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant, I\\r\\n      then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all\\r\\n      beings. For according to King Juba, the military elephants of antiquity\\r\\n      often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest\\r\\n      silence.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the elephant,\\r\\n      so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other\\r\\n      are concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an\\r\\n      equality, much less the creatures to which they respectively belong. For\\r\\n      as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to Leviathan, so, compared with\\r\\n      Leviathan&rsquo;s tail, his trunk is but the stalk of a lily. The most direful\\r\\n      blow from the elephant&rsquo;s trunk were as the playful tap of a fan, compared\\r\\n      with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale&rsquo;s ponderous\\r\\n      flukes, which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire\\r\\n      boats with all their oars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian\\r\\n      juggler tosses his balls.*\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      *Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and\\r\\n      the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the elephant\\r\\n      stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the\\r\\n      elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of curious\\r\\n      similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the elephant\\r\\n      will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then elevating it, jet\\r\\n      it forth in a stream.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my inability\\r\\n      to express it. At times there are gestures in it, which, though they would\\r\\n      well grace the hand of man, remain wholly inexplicable. In an extensive\\r\\n      herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are these mystic gestures, that I have\\r\\n      heard hunters who have declared them akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols;\\r\\n      that the whale, indeed, by these methods intelligently conversed with the\\r\\n      world. Nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general\\r\\n      body, full of strangeness, and unaccountable to his most experienced\\r\\n      assailant. Dissect him how I may, then, I but go skin deep; I know him\\r\\n      not, and never will. But if I know not even the tail of this whale, how\\r\\n      understand his head? much more, how comprehend his face, when face he has\\r\\n      none? Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face\\r\\n      shall not be seen. But I cannot completely make out his back parts; and\\r\\n      hint what he will about his face, I say again he has no face.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0087\" id=\"link2HCH0087\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 87. The Grand Armada.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from\\r\\n      the territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia. In\\r\\n      a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of Sumatra,\\r\\n      Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a vast mole, or\\r\\n      rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia, and dividing the long\\r\\n      unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes.\\r\\n      This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports for the convenience of\\r\\n      ships and whales; conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and\\r\\n      Malacca. By the straits of Sunda, chiefly, vessels bound to China from the\\r\\n      west, emerge into the China seas.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing\\r\\n      midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green\\r\\n      promontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond to\\r\\n      the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and considering\\r\\n      the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels, and gold, and\\r\\n      ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched,\\r\\n      it seems a significant provision of nature, that such treasures, by the\\r\\n      very formation of the land, should at least bear the appearance, however\\r\\n      ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping western world. The\\r\\n      shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering\\r\\n      fortresses which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and\\r\\n      the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these Orientals do not demand the\\r\\n      obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from the endless procession of\\r\\n      ships before the wind, which for centuries past, by night and by day, have\\r\\n      passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java, freighted with the\\r\\n      costliest cargoes of the east. But while they freely waive a ceremonial\\r\\n      like this, they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the low\\r\\n      shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the vessels\\r\\n      sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the point of\\r\\n      their spears. Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have\\r\\n      received at the hands of European cruisers, the audacity of these corsairs\\r\\n      has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the present day, we\\r\\n      occasionally hear of English and American vessels, which, in those waters,\\r\\n      have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits;\\r\\n      Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and thence,\\r\\n      cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here and there by\\r\\n      the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands, and gain the far\\r\\n      coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season there. By these\\r\\n      means, the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the known Sperm\\r\\n      Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to descending upon the Line\\r\\n      in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit,\\r\\n      firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby Dick, in the sea he was most\\r\\n      known to frequent; and at a season when he might most reasonably be\\r\\n      presumed to be haunting it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his crew\\r\\n      drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time, now, the\\r\\n      circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs no\\r\\n      sustenance but what&rsquo;s in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the whaler.\\r\\n      While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be transferred to\\r\\n      foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries no cargo but\\r\\n      herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a whole lake&rsquo;s\\r\\n      contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with utilities; not\\r\\n      altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She carries years&rsquo; water\\r\\n      in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat,\\r\\n      the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to drink before the brackish\\r\\n      fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian\\r\\n      streams. Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone to China from\\r\\n      New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the whale-ship, in\\r\\n      all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of soil; her crew having\\r\\n      seen no man but floating seamen like themselves. So that did you carry\\r\\n      them the news that another flood had come; they would only answer&mdash;&ldquo;Well,\\r\\n      boys, here&rsquo;s the ark!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java,\\r\\n      in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of the\\r\\n      ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an\\r\\n      excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and more\\r\\n      upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and admonished to\\r\\n      keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed\\r\\n      on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was\\r\\n      snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was descried. Almost renouncing\\r\\n      all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts, the ship had well nigh\\r\\n      entered the straits, when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft,\\r\\n      and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with which\\r\\n      of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm Whales,\\r\\n      instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies, as in\\r\\n      former times, are now frequently met with in extensive herds, sometimes\\r\\n      embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost seem as if numerous\\r\\n      nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance\\r\\n      and protection. To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense\\r\\n      caravans, may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising\\r\\n      grounds, you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together, without\\r\\n      being greeted by a single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what\\r\\n      sometimes seems thousands on thousands.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and\\r\\n      forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a\\r\\n      continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the\\r\\n      noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right\\r\\n      Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the cleft\\r\\n      drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of the\\r\\n      Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually rising\\r\\n      and falling away to leeward.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Seen from the Pequod&rsquo;s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of the\\r\\n      sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the air,\\r\\n      and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed like the\\r\\n      thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried of a balmy\\r\\n      autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,\\r\\n      accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in\\r\\n      their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain;\\r\\n      even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through\\r\\n      the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle, and\\r\\n      swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers handling\\r\\n      their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended\\r\\n      boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that chased through\\r\\n      these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental\\r\\n      seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number. And who could\\r\\n      tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby Dick himself might not\\r\\n      temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped white-elephant in the\\r\\n      coronation procession of the Siamese! So with stun-sail piled on\\r\\n      stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans before us; when, of a\\r\\n      sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly directing attention to\\r\\n      something in our wake.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rear.\\r\\n      It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling something\\r\\n      like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so completely come and\\r\\n      go; for they constantly hovered, without finally disappearing. Levelling\\r\\n      his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole, crying,\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to wet the sails;&mdash;Malays,\\r\\n      sir, and after us!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should fairly\\r\\n      have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in hot pursuit,\\r\\n      to make up for their over-cautious delay. But when the swift Pequod, with\\r\\n      a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how very kind of these\\r\\n      tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen\\r\\n      pursuit,&mdash;mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that they were. As\\r\\n      with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in his forward turn\\r\\n      beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one the bloodthirsty\\r\\n      pirates chasing <i>him</i>; some such fancy as the above seemed his. And when he\\r\\n      glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was\\r\\n      then sailing, and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to\\r\\n      his vengeance, and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both\\r\\n      chasing and being chased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd\\r\\n      of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally\\r\\n      cheering him on with their curses;&mdash;when all these conceits had\\r\\n      passed through his brain, Ahab&rsquo;s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the\\r\\n      black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being\\r\\n      able to drag the firm thing from its place.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and when,\\r\\n      after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the Pequod at\\r\\n      last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side, emerging\\r\\n      at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the harpooneers seemed more to\\r\\n      grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship, than to\\r\\n      rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the Malays. But\\r\\n      still driving on in the wake of the whales, at length they seemed abating\\r\\n      their speed; gradually the ship neared them; and the wind now dying away,\\r\\n      word was passed to spring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by\\r\\n      some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of\\r\\n      the three keels that were after them,&mdash;though as yet a mile in their\\r\\n      rear,&mdash;than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and\\r\\n      battalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked\\r\\n      bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and after\\r\\n      several hours&rsquo; pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase, when a\\r\\n      general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they\\r\\n      were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert\\r\\n      irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say\\r\\n      he is gallied. The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto\\r\\n      rapidly and steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout;\\r\\n      and like King Porus&rsquo; elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they\\r\\n      seemed going mad with consternation. In all directions expanding in vast\\r\\n      irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their\\r\\n      short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic.\\r\\n      This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number, who,\\r\\n      completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged\\r\\n      dismantled ships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of\\r\\n      simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could\\r\\n      not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional\\r\\n      timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though banding\\r\\n      together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the West have\\r\\n      fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human beings, how when\\r\\n      herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre&rsquo;s pit, they will, at the\\r\\n      slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,\\r\\n      trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best,\\r\\n      therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before\\r\\n      us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not\\r\\n      infinitely outdone by the madness of men.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion, yet\\r\\n      it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor\\r\\n      retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in\\r\\n      those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone\\r\\n      whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes&rsquo; time,\\r\\n      Queequeg&rsquo;s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray in\\r\\n      our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered straight for\\r\\n      the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part of the whale\\r\\n      struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and indeed\\r\\n      is almost always more or less anticipated; yet does it present one of the\\r\\n      more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift monster drags\\r\\n      you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect\\r\\n      life and only exist in a delirious throb.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of\\r\\n      speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we\\r\\n      thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by the\\r\\n      crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was like a\\r\\n      ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer through their\\r\\n      complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what moment it may be\\r\\n      locked in and crushed.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off from\\r\\n      this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away from\\r\\n      that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the time,\\r\\n      Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our way\\r\\n      whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no time to\\r\\n      make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their wonted duty\\r\\n      was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to the shouting\\r\\n      part of the business. &ldquo;Out of the way, Commodore!&rdquo; cried one, to a great\\r\\n      dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant\\r\\n      threatened to swamp us. &ldquo;Hard down with your tail, there!&rdquo; cried a second\\r\\n      to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself\\r\\n      with his own fan-like extremity.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented by\\r\\n      the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of equal\\r\\n      size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each other&rsquo;s grain\\r\\n      at right angles; a line of considerable length is then attached to the\\r\\n      middle of this block, and the other end of the line being looped, it can\\r\\n      in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly among gallied whales\\r\\n      that this drugg is used. For then, more whales are close round you than\\r\\n      you can possibly chase at one time. But sperm whales are not every day\\r\\n      encountered; while you may, then, you must kill all you can. And if you\\r\\n      cannot kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be\\r\\n      afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it is, that at times like these\\r\\n      the drugg, comes into requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of\\r\\n      them. The first and second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales\\r\\n      staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of\\r\\n      the towing drugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and\\r\\n      ball. But upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the\\r\\n      clumsy wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in\\r\\n      an instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the\\r\\n      boat&rsquo;s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea came\\r\\n      in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts\\r\\n      in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it not\\r\\n      that as we advanced into the herd, our whale&rsquo;s way greatly diminished;\\r\\n      moreover, that as we went still further and further from the circumference\\r\\n      of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So that when at last\\r\\n      the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale sideways vanished;\\r\\n      then, with the tapering force of his parting momentum, we glided between\\r\\n      two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal, as if from some mountain\\r\\n      torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake. Here the storms in the\\r\\n      roaring glens between the outermost whales, were heard but not felt. In\\r\\n      this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface,\\r\\n      called a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in\\r\\n      his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they\\r\\n      say lurks at the heart of every commotion. And still in the distracted\\r\\n      distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw\\r\\n      successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and\\r\\n      round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder\\r\\n      to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the\\r\\n      middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the density\\r\\n      of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding the embayed\\r\\n      axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us.\\r\\n      We must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall\\r\\n      that had only admitted us in order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of\\r\\n      the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves; the\\r\\n      women and children of this routed host.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving\\r\\n      outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any\\r\\n      one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by the\\r\\n      whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square miles.\\r\\n      At any rate&mdash;though indeed such a test at such a time might be\\r\\n      deceptive&mdash;spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that\\r\\n      seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this\\r\\n      circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked\\r\\n      up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd had\\r\\n      hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping;\\r\\n      or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way innocent and\\r\\n      inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller whales&mdash;now\\r\\n      and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake&mdash;evinced\\r\\n      a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic\\r\\n      which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like household dogs they came\\r\\n      snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till it\\r\\n      almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them. Queequeg\\r\\n      patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs with his lance; but\\r\\n      fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained from darting it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still\\r\\n      stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended in\\r\\n      those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the\\r\\n      whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become\\r\\n      mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth\\r\\n      exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will calmly\\r\\n      and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two different lives\\r\\n      at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment, be still\\r\\n      spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;&mdash;even so did\\r\\n      the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us, as if\\r\\n      we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight. Floating on their\\r\\n      sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these little\\r\\n      infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might\\r\\n      have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth. He\\r\\n      was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered\\r\\n      from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal\\r\\n      reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring, the\\r\\n      unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar&rsquo;s bow. The delicate side-fins, and\\r\\n      the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the plaited crumpled\\r\\n      appearance of a baby&rsquo;s ears newly arrived from foreign parts.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Line! line!&rdquo; cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; &ldquo;him fast! him\\r\\n      fast!&mdash;Who line him! Who struck?&mdash;Two whale; one big, one\\r\\n      little!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What ails ye, man?&rdquo; cried Starbuck.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Look-e here,&rdquo; said Queequeg, pointing down.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of\\r\\n      fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and shows\\r\\n      the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the\\r\\n      air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame\\r\\n      Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam. Not\\r\\n      seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this natural line, with the\\r\\n      maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub\\r\\n      is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed\\r\\n      divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We saw young Leviathan amours in\\r\\n      the deep.*\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      *The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but unlike\\r\\n      most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a gestation\\r\\n      which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but one at a\\r\\n      time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and\\r\\n      Jacob:&mdash;a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats,\\r\\n      curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts\\r\\n      themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious parts\\r\\n      in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter&rsquo;s lance, the mother&rsquo;s pouring\\r\\n      milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk is very\\r\\n      sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well with\\r\\n      strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute <i>more\\r\\n      hominum</i>.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and\\r\\n      affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and\\r\\n      fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled in\\r\\n      dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my\\r\\n      being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm; and\\r\\n      while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and\\r\\n      deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic\\r\\n      spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats, still\\r\\n      engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or possibly\\r\\n      carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance of room and\\r\\n      some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight of the enraged\\r\\n      drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles,\\r\\n      was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is sometimes the custom when\\r\\n      fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert, to seek to\\r\\n      hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or maiming his gigantic\\r\\n      tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled cutting-spade, to which\\r\\n      is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A whale wounded (as we\\r\\n      afterwards learned) in this part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had\\r\\n      broken away from the boat, carrying along with him half of the harpoon\\r\\n      line; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing\\r\\n      among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the\\r\\n      battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling spectacle\\r\\n      enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire\\r\\n      the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first the intervening\\r\\n      distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived that by one of the\\r\\n      unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale had become entangled in\\r\\n      the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run away with the\\r\\n      cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope attached to that\\r\\n      weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon-line round his\\r\\n      tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh. So that\\r\\n      tormented to madness, he was now churning through the water, violently\\r\\n      flailing with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him,\\r\\n      wounding and murdering his own comrades.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary\\r\\n      fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a\\r\\n      little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by half spent billows\\r\\n      from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell; the\\r\\n      submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished; in more and more\\r\\n      contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in\\r\\n      thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was departing. A low advancing hum\\r\\n      was soon heard; and then like to the tumultuous masses of block-ice when\\r\\n      the great river Hudson breaks up in Spring, the entire host of whales came\\r\\n      tumbling upon their inner centre, as if to pile themselves up in one\\r\\n      common mountain. Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck\\r\\n      taking the stern.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oars! Oars!&rdquo; he intensely whispered, seizing the helm&mdash;&ldquo;gripe your\\r\\n      oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off,\\r\\n      you Queequeg&mdash;the whale there!&mdash;prick him!&mdash;hit him! Stand\\r\\n      up&mdash;stand up, and stay so! Spring, men&mdash;pull, men; never mind\\r\\n      their backs&mdash;scrape them!&mdash;scrape away!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a\\r\\n      narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate endeavor\\r\\n      we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way rapidly, and at\\r\\n      the same time earnestly watching for another outlet. After many similar\\r\\n      hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into what had just been\\r\\n      one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random whales, all violently\\r\\n      making for one centre. This lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the\\r\\n      loss of Queequeg&rsquo;s hat, who, while standing in the bows to prick the\\r\\n      fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his head by the air-eddy\\r\\n      made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon\\r\\n      resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having clumped\\r\\n      together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their onward flight\\r\\n      with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless; but the boats still\\r\\n      lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped\\r\\n      astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask had killed and waifed. The\\r\\n      waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of which are carried by every boat;\\r\\n      and which, when additional game is at hand, are inserted upright into the\\r\\n      floating body of a dead whale, both to mark its place on the sea, and also\\r\\n      as token of prior possession, should the boats of any other ship draw\\r\\n      near.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious\\r\\n      saying in the Fishery,&mdash;the more whales the less fish. Of all the\\r\\n      drugged whales only one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for the\\r\\n      time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some other craft\\r\\n      than the Pequod.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0088\" id=\"link2HCH0088\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 88. Schools and Schoolmasters.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm\\r\\n      Whales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those\\r\\n      vast aggregations.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must have\\r\\n      been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are occasionally\\r\\n      observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each. Such bands are\\r\\n      known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those composed almost\\r\\n      entirely of females, and those mustering none but young vigorous males, or\\r\\n      bulls, as they are familiarly designated.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a\\r\\n      male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces\\r\\n      his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his\\r\\n      ladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about\\r\\n      over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and\\r\\n      endearments of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and his\\r\\n      concubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest\\r\\n      leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not more\\r\\n      than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are\\r\\n      comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen\\r\\n      yards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the\\r\\n      whole they are hereditarily entitled to <i>en bon point</i>.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent\\r\\n      ramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in leisurely\\r\\n      search of variety. You meet them on the Line in time for the full flower\\r\\n      of the Equatorial feeding season, having just returned, perhaps, from\\r\\n      spending the summer in the Northern seas, and so cheating summer of all\\r\\n      unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the time they have lounged up and down\\r\\n      the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start for the Oriental waters in\\r\\n      anticipation of the cool season there, and so evade the other excessive\\r\\n      temperature of the year.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange\\r\\n      suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his\\r\\n      interesting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming\\r\\n      that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies, with\\r\\n      what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases him away! High\\r\\n      times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to\\r\\n      invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do what the Bashaw will, he\\r\\n      cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of his bed; for, alas! all\\r\\n      fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often cause the most terrible\\r\\n      duels among their rival admirers; just so with the whales, who sometimes\\r\\n      come to deadly battle, and all for love. They fence with their long lower\\r\\n      jaws, sometimes locking them together, and so striving for the supremacy\\r\\n      like elks that warringly interweave their antlers. Not a few are captured\\r\\n      having the deep scars of these encounters,&mdash;furrowed heads, broken\\r\\n      teeth, scolloped fins; and in some instances, wrenched and dislocated\\r\\n      mouths.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the\\r\\n      first rush of the harem&rsquo;s lord, then is it very diverting to watch that\\r\\n      lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there\\r\\n      awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario, like pious\\r\\n      Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines. Granting other\\r\\n      whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of\\r\\n      these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks are too lavish of their strength,\\r\\n      and hence their unctuousness is small. As for the sons and the daughters\\r\\n      they beget, why, those sons and daughters must take care of themselves; at\\r\\n      least, with only the maternal help. For like certain other omnivorous\\r\\n      roving lovers that might be named, my Lord Whale has no taste for the\\r\\n      nursery, however much for the bower; and so, being a great traveller, he\\r\\n      leaves his anonymous babies all over the world; every baby an exotic. In\\r\\n      good time, nevertheless, as the ardour of youth declines; as years and\\r\\n      dumps increase; as reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a\\r\\n      general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and virtue\\r\\n      supplants the love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent,\\r\\n      repentant, admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and\\r\\n      grown to an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone among the\\r\\n      meridians and parallels saying his prayers, and warning each young\\r\\n      Leviathan from his amorous errors.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so is the\\r\\n      lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster. It\\r\\n      is therefore not in strict character, however admirably satirical, that\\r\\n      after going to school himself, he should then go abroad inculcating not\\r\\n      what he learned there, but the folly of it. His title, schoolmaster, would\\r\\n      very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself,\\r\\n      but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of\\r\\n      Ottoman whale, must have read the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself\\r\\n      what sort of a country-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his\\r\\n      younger days, and what was the nature of those occult lessons he\\r\\n      inculcated into some of his pupils.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale\\r\\n      betakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm Whales.\\r\\n      Almost universally, a lone whale&mdash;as a solitary Leviathan is called&mdash;proves\\r\\n      an ancient one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone, he will have no\\r\\n      one near him but Nature herself; and her he takes to wife in the\\r\\n      wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is, though she keeps so\\r\\n      many moody secrets.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously\\r\\n      mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools. For while those\\r\\n      female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or\\r\\n      forty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious of\\r\\n      all Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter;\\r\\n      excepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met, and\\r\\n      these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like a\\r\\n      mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness,\\r\\n      tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no\\r\\n      prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad\\r\\n      at Yale or Harvard. They soon relinquish this turbulence though, and when\\r\\n      about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about in quest of\\r\\n      settlements, that is, harems.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Another point of difference between the male and female schools is still\\r\\n      more characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a Forty-barrel-bull&mdash;poor\\r\\n      devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike a member of the harem school,\\r\\n      and her companions swim around her with every token of concern, sometimes\\r\\n      lingering so near her and so long, as themselves to fall a prey.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0089\" id=\"link2HCH0089\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 89. Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,\\r\\n      necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale\\r\\n      fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company, a\\r\\n      whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed and\\r\\n      captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised many minor\\r\\n      contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. For example,&mdash;after\\r\\n      a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the body may get loose\\r\\n      from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and drifting far away to\\r\\n      leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it\\r\\n      alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus the most vexatious and\\r\\n      violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen, were there not\\r\\n      some written or unwritten, universal, undisputed law applicable to all\\r\\n      cases.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment,\\r\\n      was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in A.D. 1695.\\r\\n      But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law, yet the\\r\\n      American fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this\\r\\n      matter. They have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness\\r\\n      surpasses Justinian&rsquo;s Pandects and the By-laws of the Chinese Society for\\r\\n      the Suppression of Meddling with other People&rsquo;s Business. Yes; these laws\\r\\n      might be engraven on a Queen Anne&rsquo;s farthing, or the barb of a harpoon,\\r\\n      and worn round the neck, so small are they.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      II. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable\\r\\n      brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound\\r\\n      it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      First: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast, when\\r\\n      it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at all\\r\\n      controllable by the occupant or occupants,&mdash;a mast, an oar, a\\r\\n      nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the\\r\\n      same. Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any\\r\\n      other recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing it\\r\\n      plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well as\\r\\n      their intention so to do.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen\\r\\n      themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks&mdash;the\\r\\n      Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and\\r\\n      honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where\\r\\n      it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim\\r\\n      possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. But\\r\\n      others are by no means so scrupulous.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated in\\r\\n      England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a\\r\\n      whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had\\r\\n      succeeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of\\r\\n      their lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat\\r\\n      itself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up with\\r\\n      the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it before the\\r\\n      very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were remonstrated\\r\\n      with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs&rsquo; teeth, and\\r\\n      assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done, he would now\\r\\n      retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had remained attached to the\\r\\n      whale at the time of the seizure. Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for\\r\\n      the recovery of the value of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the\\r\\n      judge. In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to\\r\\n      illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case, wherein\\r\\n      a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife&rsquo;s viciousness, had at\\r\\n      last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in the course of years,\\r\\n      repenting of that step, he instituted an action to recover possession of\\r\\n      her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then supported it by saying,\\r\\n      that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady, and had once\\r\\n      had her fast, and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging\\r\\n      viciousness, had at last abandoned her; yet abandon her he did, so that\\r\\n      she became a loose-fish; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman\\r\\n      re-harpooned her, the lady then became that subsequent gentleman&rsquo;s\\r\\n      property, along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in\\r\\n      her.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale\\r\\n      and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very\\r\\n      learned judge in set terms decided, to wit,&mdash;That as for the boat, he\\r\\n      awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to save\\r\\n      their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale, harpoons, and\\r\\n      line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because it was a\\r\\n      Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons and line\\r\\n      because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish) acquired a\\r\\n      property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish\\r\\n      had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took the fish; ergo,\\r\\n      the aforesaid articles were theirs.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might\\r\\n      possibly object to it. But ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter,\\r\\n      the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously\\r\\n      quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in the above cited\\r\\n      case; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish, I say, will, on\\r\\n      reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence; for\\r\\n      notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture, the Temple of the\\r\\n      Law, like the Temple of the Philistines, has but two props to stand on.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Is it not a saying in every one&rsquo;s mouth, Possession is half of the law:\\r\\n      that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often\\r\\n      possession is the whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of\\r\\n      Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession is\\r\\n      the whole of the law? What to the rapacious landlord is the widow&rsquo;s last\\r\\n      mite but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder undetected villain&rsquo;s marble mansion\\r\\n      with a door-plate for a waif; what is that but a Fast-Fish? What is the\\r\\n      ruinous discount which Mordecai, the broker, gets from poor Woebegone, the\\r\\n      bankrupt, on a loan to keep Woebegone&rsquo;s family from starvation; what is\\r\\n      that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the Archbishop of\\r\\n      Savesoul&rsquo;s income of Â£100,000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of\\r\\n      hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure of heaven\\r\\n      without any of Savesoul&rsquo;s help) what is that globular Â£100,000 but a\\r\\n      Fast-Fish? What are the Duke of Dunder&rsquo;s hereditary towns and hamlets but\\r\\n      Fast-Fish? What to that redoubted harpooneer, John Bull, is poor Ireland,\\r\\n      but a Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic lancer, Brother Jonathan, is Texas\\r\\n      but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all these, is not Possession the whole of\\r\\n      the law?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the\\r\\n      kindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is\\r\\n      internationally and universally applicable.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the\\r\\n      Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress?\\r\\n      What was Poland to the Czar? What Greece to the Turk? What India to\\r\\n      England? What at last will Mexico be to the United States? All Loose-Fish.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      What are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but Loose-Fish?\\r\\n      What all men&rsquo;s minds and opinions but Loose-Fish? What is the principle of\\r\\n      religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish? What to the ostentatious\\r\\n      smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but Loose-Fish? What is\\r\\n      the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish? And what are you, reader, but a\\r\\n      Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish, too?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0090\" id=\"link2HCH0090\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 90. Heads or Tails.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam.&rdquo; <i>Bracton,\\r\\n      l. 3, c. 3.</i>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the\\r\\n      context, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of\\r\\n      that land, the King, as Honorary Grand Harpooneer, must have the head,\\r\\n      and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail. A division which,\\r\\n      in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is no intermediate\\r\\n      remainder. Now as this law, under a modified form, is to this day in force\\r\\n      in England; and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly\\r\\n      touching the general law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is here treated of in\\r\\n      a separate chapter, on the same courteous principle that prompts the\\r\\n      English railways to be at the expense of a separate car, specially\\r\\n      reserved for the accommodation of royalty. In the first place, in curious\\r\\n      proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is still in force, I\\r\\n      proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two\\r\\n      years.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one of\\r\\n      the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching\\r\\n      a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore.\\r\\n      Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a\\r\\n      sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden. Holding the office\\r\\n      directly from the crown, I believe, all the royal emoluments incident to\\r\\n      the Cinque Port territories become by assignment his. By some writers this\\r\\n      office is called a sinecure. But not so. Because the Lord Warden is busily\\r\\n      employed at times in fobbing his perquisites; which are his chiefly by\\r\\n      virtue of that same fobbing of them.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their\\r\\n      trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their fat\\r\\n      fish high and dry, promising themselves a good Â£150 from the precious oil\\r\\n      and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives, and good ale\\r\\n      with their cronies, upon the strength of their respective shares; up steps\\r\\n      a very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman, with a copy of\\r\\n      Blackstone under his arm; and laying it upon the whale&rsquo;s head, he says&mdash;&ldquo;Hands\\r\\n      off! this fish, my masters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it as the Lord\\r\\n      Warden&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Upon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternation&mdash;so\\r\\n      truly English&mdash;knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching\\r\\n      their heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the\\r\\n      stranger. But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the\\r\\n      hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone. At length\\r\\n      one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made bold to\\r\\n      speak,\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The Duke.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;It is his.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all\\r\\n      that to go to the Duke&rsquo;s benefit; we getting nothing at all for our pains\\r\\n      but our blisters?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;It is his.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of\\r\\n      getting a livelihood?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;It is his.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of this\\r\\n      whale.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;It is his.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;It is his.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of\\r\\n      Wellington received the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular\\r\\n      lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be\\r\\n      deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman of\\r\\n      the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace, begging him to take\\r\\n      the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To which\\r\\n      my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published) that he\\r\\n      had already done so, and received the money, and would be obliged to the\\r\\n      reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend gentleman) would\\r\\n      decline meddling with other people&rsquo;s business. Is this the still militant\\r\\n      old man, standing at the corners of the three kingdoms, on all hands\\r\\n      coercing alms of beggars?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to\\r\\n      the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs inquire\\r\\n      then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested with that\\r\\n      right. The law itself has already been set forth. But Plowdon gives us the\\r\\n      reason for it. Says Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs to the King and\\r\\n      Queen, &ldquo;because of its superior excellence.&rdquo; And by the soundest\\r\\n      commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such matters.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason\\r\\n      for that, ye lawyers!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In his treatise on &ldquo;Queen-Gold,&rdquo; or Queen-pinmoney, an old King&rsquo;s Bench\\r\\n      author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: &ldquo;Ye tail is ye Queen&rsquo;s, that\\r\\n      ye Queen&rsquo;s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.&rdquo; Now this was\\r\\n      written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right\\r\\n      whale was largely used in ladies&rsquo; bodices. But this same bone is not in\\r\\n      the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer\\r\\n      like Prynne. But is the Queen a mermaid, to be presented with a tail? An\\r\\n      allegorical meaning may lurk here.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers&mdash;the\\r\\n      whale and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and\\r\\n      nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown&rsquo;s ordinary revenue. I\\r\\n      know not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by inference\\r\\n      it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the\\r\\n      whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to\\r\\n      that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be humorously\\r\\n      grounded upon some presumed congeniality. And thus there seems a reason in\\r\\n      all things, even in law.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0091\" id=\"link2HCH0091\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 91. The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this Leviathan,\\r\\n      insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.&rdquo; <i>Sir T. Browne, V.E.</i>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when we\\r\\n      were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that the many\\r\\n      noses on the Pequod&rsquo;s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three\\r\\n      pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in\\r\\n      the sea.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I will bet something now,&rdquo; said Stubb, &ldquo;that somewhere hereabouts are\\r\\n      some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they\\r\\n      would keel up before long.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Presently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance\\r\\n      lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be\\r\\n      alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours from\\r\\n      his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled, and\\r\\n      hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the whale alongside\\r\\n      must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that is, a whale that has\\r\\n      died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an unappropriated corpse. It\\r\\n      may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale;\\r\\n      worse than an Assyrian city in the plague, when the living are incompetent\\r\\n      to bury the departed. So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some, that\\r\\n      no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it. Yet are there\\r\\n      those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained\\r\\n      from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and by no means of the\\r\\n      nature of attar-of-rose.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman\\r\\n      had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of a\\r\\n      nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those\\r\\n      problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious\\r\\n      dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely\\r\\n      bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the proper place we shall\\r\\n      see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale\\r\\n      as this, however much he may shun blasted whales in general.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he\\r\\n      recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were knotted\\r\\n      round the tail of one of these whales.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a pretty fellow, now,&rdquo; he banteringly laughed, standing in the\\r\\n      ship&rsquo;s bows, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a jackal for ye! I well know that these Crappoes of\\r\\n      Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering their\\r\\n      boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes, and\\r\\n      sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow\\r\\n      candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they will get\\r\\n      won&rsquo;t be enough to dip the Captain&rsquo;s wick into; aye, we all know these\\r\\n      things; but look ye, here&rsquo;s a Crappo that is content with our leavings,\\r\\n      the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too with scraping the\\r\\n      dry bones of that other precious fish he has there. Poor devil! I say,\\r\\n      pass round a hat, some one, and let&rsquo;s make him a present of a little oil\\r\\n      for dear charity&rsquo;s sake. For what oil he&rsquo;ll get from that drugged whale\\r\\n      there, wouldn&rsquo;t be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a condemned cell. And\\r\\n      as for the other whale, why, I&rsquo;ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and\\r\\n      trying out these three masts of ours, than he&rsquo;ll get from that bundle of\\r\\n      bones; though, now that I think of it, it may contain something worth a\\r\\n      good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris. I wonder now if our old man has\\r\\n      thought of that. It&rsquo;s worth trying. Yes, I&rsquo;m for it;&rdquo; and so saying he\\r\\n      started for the quarter-deck.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether or\\r\\n      no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope of\\r\\n      escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin, Stubb\\r\\n      now called his boat&rsquo;s crew, and pulled off for the stranger. Drawing\\r\\n      across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French\\r\\n      taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a\\r\\n      huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for thorns had copper spikes\\r\\n      projecting from it here and there; the whole terminating in a symmetrical\\r\\n      folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon her head boards, in large gilt\\r\\n      letters, he read &ldquo;Bouton de Rose,&rdquo;&mdash;Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and\\r\\n      this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Though Stubb did not understand the <i>Bouton</i> part of the inscription, yet\\r\\n      the word <i>rose</i>, and the bulbous figure-head put together, sufficiently\\r\\n      explained the whole to him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;A wooden rose-bud, eh?&rdquo; he cried with his hand to his nose, &ldquo;that will do\\r\\n      very well; but how like all creation it smells!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he had\\r\\n      to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close to the\\r\\n      blasted whale; and so talk over it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he bawled&mdash;&ldquo;Bouton-de-Rose,\\r\\n      ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that speak English?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be the\\r\\n      chief-mate.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;<i>What</i> whale?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The <i>White</i> Whale&mdash;a Sperm Whale&mdash;Moby Dick, have ye seen him?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale&mdash;no.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Very good, then; good bye now, and I&rsquo;ll call again in a minute.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning over\\r\\n      the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two hands into a\\r\\n      trumpet and shouted&mdash;&ldquo;No, Sir! No!&rdquo; Upon which Ahab retired, and\\r\\n      Stubb returned to the Frenchman.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the chains,\\r\\n      and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of bag.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with your nose, there?&rdquo; said Stubb. &ldquo;Broke it?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I wish it was broken, or that I didn&rsquo;t have any nose at all!&rdquo; answered\\r\\n      the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much.\\r\\n      &ldquo;But what are you holding <i>yours</i> for?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oh, nothing! It&rsquo;s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain&rsquo;t it?\\r\\n      Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will ye,\\r\\n      Bouton-de-Rose?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What in the devil&rsquo;s name do you want here?&rdquo; roared the Guernseyman,\\r\\n      flying into a sudden passion.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oh! keep cool&mdash;cool? yes, that&rsquo;s the word! why don&rsquo;t you pack those\\r\\n      whales in ice while you&rsquo;re working at &rsquo;em? But joking aside, though; do\\r\\n      you know, Rose-bud, that it&rsquo;s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of\\r\\n      such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn&rsquo;t a gill in his\\r\\n      whole carcase.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I know that well enough; but, d&rsquo;ye see, the Captain here won&rsquo;t believe\\r\\n      it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But\\r\\n      come aboard, and mayhap he&rsquo;ll believe you, if he won&rsquo;t me; and so I&rsquo;ll get\\r\\n      out of this dirty scrape.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,&rdquo; rejoined Stubb, and\\r\\n      with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene presented\\r\\n      itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the\\r\\n      heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked rather slow and\\r\\n      talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good humor. All their noses\\r\\n      upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib-booms. Now and then\\r\\n      pairs of them would drop their work, and run up to the mast-head to get\\r\\n      some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch the plague, dipped oakum in\\r\\n      coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their nostrils. Others having broken\\r\\n      the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously\\r\\n      puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their olfactories.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the\\r\\n      Captain&rsquo;s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a fiery\\r\\n      face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from within. This\\r\\n      was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain remonstrating against the\\r\\n      proceedings of the day, had betaken himself to the Captain&rsquo;s round-house\\r\\n      (<i>cabinet</i> he called it) to avoid the pest; but still, could not help\\r\\n      yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the\\r\\n      Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate\\r\\n      expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who had\\r\\n      brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle. Sounding him\\r\\n      carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man had not the\\r\\n      slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore held his peace\\r\\n      on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him, so\\r\\n      that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and\\r\\n      satirizing the Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their\\r\\n      sincerity. According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man,\\r\\n      under cover of an interpreter&rsquo;s office, was to tell the Captain what he\\r\\n      pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter any\\r\\n      nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a small\\r\\n      and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with large\\r\\n      whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet vest with\\r\\n      watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now politely\\r\\n      introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put on the\\r\\n      aspect of interpreting between them.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What shall I say to him first?&rdquo; said he.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, &ldquo;you\\r\\n      may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,\\r\\n      though I don&rsquo;t pretend to be a judge.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He says, Monsieur,&rdquo; said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his\\r\\n      captain, &ldquo;that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain and\\r\\n      chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a\\r\\n      blasted whale they had brought alongside.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What now?&rdquo; said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him\\r\\n      carefully, I&rsquo;m quite certain that he&rsquo;s no more fit to command a whale-ship\\r\\n      than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he&rsquo;s a baboon.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one, is\\r\\n      far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures us,\\r\\n      as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his crew\\r\\n      to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast loose the\\r\\n      cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What now?&rdquo; said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to them.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that&mdash;that&mdash;in\\r\\n      fact, tell him I&rsquo;ve diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody\\r\\n      else.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He says, Monsieur, that he&rsquo;s very happy to have been of any service to\\r\\n      us.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties\\r\\n      (meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his\\r\\n      cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,&rdquo; said the interpreter.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Thank him heartily; but tell him it&rsquo;s against my principles to drink with\\r\\n      the man I&rsquo;ve diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He says, Monsieur, that his principles won&rsquo;t admit of his drinking; but\\r\\n      that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur had\\r\\n      best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales, for\\r\\n      it&rsquo;s so calm they won&rsquo;t drift.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed\\r\\n      the Guernsey-man to this effect,&mdash;that having a long tow-line in his\\r\\n      boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the lighter\\r\\n      whale of the two from the ship&rsquo;s side. While the Frenchman&rsquo;s boats, then,\\r\\n      were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb benevolently towed away at\\r\\n      his whale the other way, ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long\\r\\n      tow-line.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;\\r\\n      hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while the\\r\\n      Pequod slid in between him and Stubb&rsquo;s whale. Whereupon Stubb quickly\\r\\n      pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his\\r\\n      intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous\\r\\n      cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an excavation in the\\r\\n      body, a little behind the side fin. You would almost have thought he was\\r\\n      digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at length his spade struck\\r\\n      against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery\\r\\n      buried in fat English loam. His boat&rsquo;s crew were all in high excitement,\\r\\n      eagerly helping their chief, and looking as anxious as gold-hunters.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and screaming,\\r\\n      and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning to look\\r\\n      disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased, when suddenly\\r\\n      from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a faint stream of\\r\\n      perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being\\r\\n      absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then along with another,\\r\\n      without at all blending with it for a time.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I have it, I have it,&rdquo; cried Stubb, with delight, striking something in\\r\\n      the subterranean regions, &ldquo;a purse! a purse!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of\\r\\n      something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old cheese;\\r\\n      very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with your thumb;\\r\\n      it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this, good friends, is\\r\\n      ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist. Some six handfuls\\r\\n      were obtained; but more was unavoidably lost in the sea, and still more,\\r\\n      perhaps, might have been secured were it not for impatient Ahab&rsquo;s loud\\r\\n      command to Stubb to desist, and come on board, else the ship would bid\\r\\n      them good bye.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0092\" id=\"link2HCH0092\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 92. Ambergris.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an\\r\\n      article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain Coffin\\r\\n      was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject.\\r\\n      For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day, the precise\\r\\n      origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem to the learned.\\r\\n      Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for grey amber, yet\\r\\n      the two substances are quite distinct. For amber, though at times found on\\r\\n      the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris\\r\\n      is never found except upon the sea. Besides, amber is a hard, transparent,\\r\\n      brittle, odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and\\r\\n      ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy,\\r\\n      that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles,\\r\\n      hair-powders, and pomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it\\r\\n      to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter&rsquo;s\\r\\n      in Rome. Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale\\r\\n      themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale!\\r\\n      Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the cause, and by\\r\\n      others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such a\\r\\n      dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering three or four boat\\r\\n      loads of Brandreth&rsquo;s pills, and then running out of harm&rsquo;s way, as\\r\\n      laborers do in blasting rocks.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris, certain\\r\\n      hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be sailors&rsquo;\\r\\n      trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more\\r\\n      than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found\\r\\n      in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that saying\\r\\n      of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption; how that we\\r\\n      are sown in dishonor, but raised in glory. And likewise call to mind that\\r\\n      saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk. Also\\r\\n      forget not the strange fact that of all things of ill-savor,\\r\\n      Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is the worst.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but cannot,\\r\\n      owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen, and\\r\\n      which, in the estimation of some already biased minds, might be considered\\r\\n      as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the Frenchman&rsquo;s two\\r\\n      whales. Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been\\r\\n      disproved, that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly, untidy\\r\\n      business. But there is another thing to rebut. They hint that all whales\\r\\n      always smell bad. Now how did this odious stigma originate?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\\r\\n      Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because\\r\\n      those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as\\r\\n      the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in\\r\\n      small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks, and carry it\\r\\n      home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas, and\\r\\n      the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed, forbidding any\\r\\n      other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking into the hold, and\\r\\n      unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is\\r\\n      given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city\\r\\n      grave-yard, for the foundations of a Lying-in Hospital.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be\\r\\n      likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former\\r\\n      times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which\\r\\n      latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great\\r\\n      work on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports (smeer,\\r\\n      fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to afford a place\\r\\n      for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out, without being\\r\\n      taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a collection of furnaces,\\r\\n      fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in full operation\\r\\n      certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But all this is quite\\r\\n      different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years\\r\\n      perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps,\\r\\n      consume fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that\\r\\n      it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless. The truth is, that living or\\r\\n      dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means\\r\\n      creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people of\\r\\n      the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the nose. Nor\\r\\n      indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant, when, as a\\r\\n      general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking abundance of exercise;\\r\\n      always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the open air. I say,\\r\\n      that the motion of a Sperm Whale&rsquo;s flukes above water dispenses a perfume,\\r\\n      as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What then\\r\\n      shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude?\\r\\n      Must it not be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent\\r\\n      with myrrh, which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to Alexander\\r\\n      the Great?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0093\" id=\"link2HCH0093\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 93. The Castaway.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most\\r\\n      significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod&rsquo;s crew; an\\r\\n      event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes madly\\r\\n      merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy\\r\\n      of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats. Some\\r\\n      few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is to work\\r\\n      the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. As a general thing,\\r\\n      these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats&rsquo;\\r\\n      crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy, or timorous\\r\\n      wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a ship-keeper. It was\\r\\n      so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by\\r\\n      abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before; ye must remember his\\r\\n      tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so gloomy-jolly.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and a\\r\\n      white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven in\\r\\n      one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and\\r\\n      torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at bottom\\r\\n      very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his\\r\\n      tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer,\\r\\n      freer relish than any other race. For blacks, the year&rsquo;s calendar should\\r\\n      show naught but three hundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and New\\r\\n      Year&rsquo;s Days. Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was\\r\\n      brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous\\r\\n      ebony, panelled in king&rsquo;s cabinets. But Pip loved life, and all life&rsquo;s\\r\\n      peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he had\\r\\n      somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred his\\r\\n      brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus temporarily\\r\\n      subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange\\r\\n      wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural\\r\\n      lustre with which in his native Tolland County in Connecticut, he had once\\r\\n      enlivened many a fiddler&rsquo;s frolic on the green; and at melodious\\r\\n      even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the round horizon into one\\r\\n      star-belled tambourine. So, though in the clear air of day, suspended\\r\\n      against a blue-veined neck, the pure-watered diamond drop will healthful\\r\\n      glow; yet, when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its\\r\\n      most impressive lustre, he lays it against a gloomy ground, and then\\r\\n      lights it up, not by the sun, but by some unnatural gases. Then come out\\r\\n      those fiery effulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond,\\r\\n      once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel\\r\\n      stolen from the King of Hell. But let us to the story.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb&rsquo;s after-oarsman\\r\\n      chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed; and,\\r\\n      temporarily, Pip was put into his place.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness; but\\r\\n      happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and\\r\\n      therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing\\r\\n      him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to\\r\\n      the utmost, for he might often find it needful.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as the\\r\\n      fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which happened,\\r\\n      in this instance, to be right under poor Pip&rsquo;s seat. The involuntary\\r\\n      consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in hand, out of the\\r\\n      boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale line coming against\\r\\n      his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as to become entangled in\\r\\n      it, when at last plumping into the water. That instant the stricken whale\\r\\n      started on a fierce run, the line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor\\r\\n      Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged\\r\\n      there by the line, which had taken several turns around his chest and\\r\\n      neck.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He hated\\r\\n      Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he suspended\\r\\n      its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb, exclaimed\\r\\n      interrogatively, &ldquo;Cut?&rdquo; Meantime Pip&rsquo;s blue, choked face plainly looked,\\r\\n      Do, for God&rsquo;s sake! All passed in a flash. In less than half a minute,\\r\\n      this entire thing happened.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Damn him, cut!&rdquo; roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was\\r\\n      saved.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by\\r\\n      yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these irregular\\r\\n      cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like, but still\\r\\n      half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done, unofficially\\r\\n      gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never jump from a boat,\\r\\n      Pip, except&mdash;but all the rest was indefinite, as the soundest advice\\r\\n      ever is. Now, in general, <i>Stick to the boat</i>, is your true motto in\\r\\n      whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when <i>Leap from the boat</i>, is still\\r\\n      better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if he should give\\r\\n      undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a\\r\\n      margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice, and\\r\\n      concluded with a peremptory command, &ldquo;Stick to the boat, Pip, or by the\\r\\n      Lord, I won&rsquo;t pick you up if you jump; mind that. We can&rsquo;t afford to lose\\r\\n      whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for thirty times what you\\r\\n      would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and don&rsquo;t jump any more.&rdquo;\\r\\n       Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that though man loved his fellow,\\r\\n      yet man is a money-making animal, which propensity too often interferes\\r\\n      with his benevolence.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was\\r\\n      under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this time\\r\\n      he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started to run,\\r\\n      Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller&rsquo;s trunk. Alas!\\r\\n      Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful, bounteous, blue\\r\\n      day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly stretching away, all\\r\\n      round, to the horizon, like gold-beater&rsquo;s skin hammered out to the\\r\\n      extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip&rsquo;s ebon head showed like a\\r\\n      head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern.\\r\\n      Stubb&rsquo;s inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged. In\\r\\n      three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb.\\r\\n      Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp, curling, black\\r\\n      head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the loftiest and the\\r\\n      brightest.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\\r\\n      practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful\\r\\n      lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the\\r\\n      middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark, how\\r\\n      when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea&mdash;mark how closely\\r\\n      they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No; he\\r\\n      did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake, and\\r\\n      he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very\\r\\n      quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards\\r\\n      oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always manifested\\r\\n      by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances not\\r\\n      unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so called,\\r\\n      is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies\\r\\n      and armies.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly spying\\r\\n      whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and Stubb&rsquo;s boat\\r\\n      was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish, that\\r\\n      Pip&rsquo;s ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably. By the merest\\r\\n      chance the ship itself at last rescued him; but from that hour the little\\r\\n      negro went about the deck an idiot; such, at least, they said he was. The\\r\\n      sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his\\r\\n      soul. Not drowned entirely, though. Rather carried down alive to wondrous\\r\\n      depths, where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and\\r\\n      fro before his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his\\r\\n      hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities,\\r\\n      Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the\\r\\n      firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God&rsquo;s foot upon the\\r\\n      treadle of the loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him\\r\\n      mad. So man&rsquo;s insanity is heaven&rsquo;s sense; and wandering from all mortal\\r\\n      reason, man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is\\r\\n      absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent\\r\\n      as his God.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that\\r\\n      fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what\\r\\n      like abandonment befell myself.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0094\" id=\"link2HCH0094\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 94. A Squeeze of the Hand.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      That whale of Stubb&rsquo;s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the\\r\\n      Pequod&rsquo;s side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously\\r\\n      detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling of the\\r\\n      Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      While some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed in\\r\\n      dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm; and when\\r\\n      the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere\\r\\n      going to the try-works, of which anon.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with several\\r\\n      others, I sat down before a large Constantine&rsquo;s bath of it, I found it\\r\\n      strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about in the liquid\\r\\n      part. It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid. A sweet\\r\\n      and unctuous duty! No wonder that in old times this sperm was such a\\r\\n      favourite cosmetic. Such a clearer! such a sweetener! such a softener!\\r\\n      such a delicious molifier! After having my hands in it for only a few\\r\\n      minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it were, to serpentine\\r\\n      and spiralise.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter\\r\\n      exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under\\r\\n      indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands among\\r\\n      those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost within\\r\\n      the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and discharged all their\\r\\n      opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that\\r\\n      uncontaminated aroma,&mdash;literally and truly, like the smell of spring\\r\\n      violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky meadow;\\r\\n      I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible sperm, I\\r\\n      washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit the old\\r\\n      Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat\\r\\n      of anger; while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely free from all\\r\\n      ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort whatsoever.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm\\r\\n      till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a strange\\r\\n      sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my\\r\\n      co-laborers&rsquo; hands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules.\\r\\n      Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this\\r\\n      avocation beget; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands, and\\r\\n      looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as much as to say,&mdash;Oh! my\\r\\n      dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or\\r\\n      know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come; let us squeeze hands all\\r\\n      round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze\\r\\n      ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since by\\r\\n      many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all cases\\r\\n      man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of attainable\\r\\n      felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy; but in\\r\\n      the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the fireside, the\\r\\n      country; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case\\r\\n      eternally. In thoughts of the visions of the night, I saw long rows of\\r\\n      angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things akin\\r\\n      to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try-works.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering\\r\\n      part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It is\\r\\n      tough with congealed tendons&mdash;a wad of muscle&mdash;but still\\r\\n      contains some oil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is\\r\\n      first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much\\r\\n      like blocks of Berkshire marble.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the\\r\\n      whale&rsquo;s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and\\r\\n      often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is a\\r\\n      most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name\\r\\n      imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked\\r\\n      snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and\\r\\n      purple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason, it\\r\\n      is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I stole\\r\\n      behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should conceive a\\r\\n      royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have tasted, supposing\\r\\n      him to have been killed the first day after the venison season, and that\\r\\n      particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of\\r\\n      the vineyards of Champagne.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in the\\r\\n      course of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling\\r\\n      adequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation original\\r\\n      with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of the substance. It is an\\r\\n      ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found in the tubs of\\r\\n      sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent decanting. I hold it to\\r\\n      be the wondrously thin, ruptured membranes of the case, coalescing.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but\\r\\n      sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the\\r\\n      dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland\\r\\n      or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls\\r\\n      who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale&rsquo;s vocabulary.\\r\\n      But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman&rsquo;s nipper is a short\\r\\n      firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan&rsquo;s\\r\\n      tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the rest, is about the\\r\\n      size of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along the oily deck, it\\r\\n      operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless blandishments, as of\\r\\n      magic, allures along with it all impurities.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at once\\r\\n      to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its inmates.\\r\\n      This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the\\r\\n      blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale. When the proper\\r\\n      time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a scene of\\r\\n      terror to all tyros, especially by night. On one side, lit by a dull\\r\\n      lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen. They generally go in\\r\\n      pairs,&mdash;a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The whaling-pike is\\r\\n      similar to a frigate&rsquo;s boarding-weapon of the same name. The gaff is\\r\\n      something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the gaffman hooks on to a sheet\\r\\n      of blubber, and strives to hold it from slipping, as the ship pitches and\\r\\n      lurches about. Meanwhile, the spade-man stands on the sheet itself,\\r\\n      perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse-pieces. This spade is\\r\\n      sharp as hone can make it; the spademan&rsquo;s feet are shoeless; the thing he\\r\\n      stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge.\\r\\n      If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants&rsquo;, would you\\r\\n      be very much astonished? Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0095\" id=\"link2HCH0095\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 95. The Cassock.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this\\r\\n      post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the\\r\\n      windlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small\\r\\n      curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would have seen\\r\\n      there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers. Not the wondrous\\r\\n      cistern in the whale&rsquo;s huge head; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower\\r\\n      jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of these would so\\r\\n      surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone,&mdash;longer\\r\\n      than a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and\\r\\n      jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed, it is;\\r\\n      or, rather, in old times, its likeness was. Such an idol as that found in\\r\\n      the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and for worshipping which,\\r\\n      King Asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the idol, and burnt it\\r\\n      for an abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly set forth in the 15th\\r\\n      chapter of the First Book of Kings.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and assisted\\r\\n      by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners call it,\\r\\n      and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier\\r\\n      carrying a dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the forecastle\\r\\n      deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt, as an African\\r\\n      hunter the pelt of a boa. This done he turns the pelt inside out, like a\\r\\n      pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as almost to double its\\r\\n      diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in the rigging, to dry. Ere\\r\\n      long, it is taken down; when removing some three feet of it, towards the\\r\\n      pointed extremity, and then cutting two slits for arm-holes at the other\\r\\n      end, he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it. The mincer now stands\\r\\n      before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling. Immemorial to\\r\\n      all his order, this investiture alone will adequately protect him, while\\r\\n      employed in the peculiar functions of his office.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the pots;\\r\\n      an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse, planted endwise\\r\\n      against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath it, into which the\\r\\n      minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets from a rapt orator&rsquo;s desk. Arrayed\\r\\n      in decent black; occupying a conspicuous pulpit; intent on bible leaves;\\r\\n      what a candidate for an archbishopric, what a lad for a Pope were this\\r\\n      mincer!*\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      *Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the mates to\\r\\n      the mincer. It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as thin\\r\\n      slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out\\r\\n      the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity considerably increased,\\r\\n      besides perhaps improving it in quality.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0096\" id=\"link2HCH0096\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 96. The Try-Works.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly distinguished\\r\\n      by her try-works. She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid\\r\\n      masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship. It\\r\\n      is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were transported to her planks.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most\\r\\n      roomy part of the deck. The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength,\\r\\n      fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar,\\r\\n      some ten feet by eight square, and five in height. The foundation does not\\r\\n      penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by\\r\\n      ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides, and screwing it down to\\r\\n      the timbers. On the flanks it is cased with wood, and at top completely\\r\\n      covered by a large, sloping, battened hatchway. Removing this hatch we\\r\\n      expose the great try-pots, two in number, and each of several barrels&rsquo;\\r\\n      capacity. When not in use, they are kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they\\r\\n      are polished with soapstone and sand, till they shine within like silver\\r\\n      punch-bowls. During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl\\r\\n      into them and coil themselves away there for a nap. While employed in\\r\\n      polishing them&mdash;one man in each pot, side by side&mdash;many\\r\\n      confidential communications are carried on, over the iron lips. It is a\\r\\n      place also for profound mathematical meditation. It was in the left hand\\r\\n      try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone diligently circling round me,\\r\\n      that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in\\r\\n      geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example,\\r\\n      will descend from any point in precisely the same time.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare masonry\\r\\n      of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of the\\r\\n      furnaces, directly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted with heavy\\r\\n      doors of iron. The intense heat of the fire is prevented from\\r\\n      communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir\\r\\n      extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works. By a tunnel\\r\\n      inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as\\r\\n      fast as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open direct\\r\\n      from the rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was about nine o&rsquo;clock at night that the Pequod&rsquo;s try-works were first\\r\\n      started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee the\\r\\n      business.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the\\r\\n      works.&rdquo; This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting his\\r\\n      shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said that in\\r\\n      a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed for a time\\r\\n      with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of quick ignition\\r\\n      to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out, the crisp,\\r\\n      shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still contains\\r\\n      considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed the flames.\\r\\n      Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming misanthrope, once\\r\\n      ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body. Would\\r\\n      that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is horrible to inhale, and\\r\\n      inhale it you must, and not only that, but you must live in it for the\\r\\n      time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such as may lurk\\r\\n      in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells like the left wing of the day\\r\\n      of judgment; it is an argument for the pit.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      By midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the\\r\\n      carcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean\\r\\n      darkness was intense. But that darkness was licked up by the fierce\\r\\n      flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and\\r\\n      illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek fire.\\r\\n      The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to some\\r\\n      vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the bold\\r\\n      Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad sheets\\r\\n      of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates, and folded them\\r\\n      in conflagrations.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide hearth\\r\\n      in front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan\\r\\n      harpooneers, always the whale-ship&rsquo;s stokers. With huge pronged poles they\\r\\n      pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or stirred up\\r\\n      the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted, curling, out of the doors\\r\\n      to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled away in sullen heaps. To every\\r\\n      pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil, which seemed all\\r\\n      eagerness to leap into their faces. Opposite the mouth of the works, on\\r\\n      the further side of the wide wooden hearth, was the windlass. This served\\r\\n      for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the watch, when not otherwise employed,\\r\\n      looking into the red heat of the fire, till their eyes felt scorched in\\r\\n      their heads. Their tawny features, now all begrimed with smoke and sweat,\\r\\n      their matted beards, and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their\\r\\n      teeth, all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of\\r\\n      the works. As they narrated to each other their unholy adventures, their\\r\\n      tales of terror told in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter\\r\\n      forked upwards out of them, like the flames from the furnace; as to and\\r\\n      fro, in their front, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge\\r\\n      pronged forks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and\\r\\n      the ship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further\\r\\n      and further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully\\r\\n      champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on all\\r\\n      sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden with\\r\\n      fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of darkness,\\r\\n      seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander&rsquo;s soul.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently\\r\\n      guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that interval,\\r\\n      in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness, the madness, the\\r\\n      ghastliness of others. The continual sight of the fiend shapes before me,\\r\\n      capering half in smoke and half in fire, these at last begat kindred\\r\\n      visions in my soul, so soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable\\r\\n      drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable)\\r\\n      thing occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was horribly\\r\\n      conscious of something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller smote my side,\\r\\n      which leaned against it; in my ears was the low hum of sails, just\\r\\n      beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were open; I was half\\r\\n      conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching\\r\\n      them still further apart. But, spite of all this, I could see no compass\\r\\n      before me to steer by; though it seemed but a minute since I had been\\r\\n      watching the card, by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it. Nothing\\r\\n      seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by flashes of\\r\\n      redness. Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing thing\\r\\n      I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all\\r\\n      havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came over me.\\r\\n      Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with the crazy conceit that\\r\\n      the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is\\r\\n      the matter with me? thought I. Lo! in my brief sleep I had turned myself\\r\\n      about, and was fronting the ship&rsquo;s stern, with my back to her prow and the\\r\\n      compass. In an instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel\\r\\n      from flying up into the wind, and very probably capsizing her. How glad\\r\\n      and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the\\r\\n      night, and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream with thy\\r\\n      hand on the helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first hint\\r\\n      of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its redness\\r\\n      makes all things look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun, the skies\\r\\n      will be bright; those who glared like devils in the forking flames, the\\r\\n      morn will show in far other, at least gentler, relief; the glorious,\\r\\n      golden, glad sun, the only true lamp&mdash;all others but liars!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia&rsquo;s Dismal Swamp, nor Rome&rsquo;s\\r\\n      accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of\\r\\n      deserts and of griefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean, which\\r\\n      is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this earth. So,\\r\\n      therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him, that\\r\\n      mortal man cannot be true&mdash;not true, or undeveloped. With books the\\r\\n      same. The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows, and the truest of all\\r\\n      books is Solomon&rsquo;s, and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe.\\r\\n      &ldquo;All is vanity.&rdquo; ALL. This wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian\\r\\n      Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom yet. But he who dodges hospitals and jails, and walks\\r\\n      fast crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of operas than hell; calls\\r\\n      Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all of sick men; and\\r\\n      throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing wise, and\\r\\n      therefore jolly;&mdash;not that man is fitted to sit down on tomb-stones,\\r\\n      and break the green damp mould with unfathomably wondrous Solomon.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But even Solomon, he says, &ldquo;the man that wandereth out of the way of\\r\\n      understanding shall remain&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, even while living) &ldquo;in the congregation\\r\\n      of the dead.&rdquo; Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it invert thee,\\r\\n      deaden thee; as for the time it did me. There is a wisdom that is woe; but\\r\\n      there is a woe that is madness. And there is a Catskill eagle in some\\r\\n      souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of\\r\\n      them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces. And even if he for\\r\\n      ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains; so that even\\r\\n      in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds\\r\\n      upon the plain, even though they soar.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0097\" id=\"link2HCH0097\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 97.

There they lay in their triangular oaken\\r\\n      vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a score of lamps flashing upon\\r\\n      his hooded eyes.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens.\\r\\n      To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in darkness to his\\r\\n      pallet, this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he seeks the food of\\r\\n      light, so he lives in light.

Stowing Down and Clearing Up.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried\\r\\n      from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors, and\\r\\n      slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed alongside and\\r\\n      beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the headsman of old to\\r\\n      the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his great padded surtout\\r\\n      becomes the property of his executioner; how, in due time, he is condemned\\r\\n      to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, his spermaceti,\\r\\n      oil, and bone pass unscathed through the fire;&mdash;but now it remains to\\r\\n      conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by rehearsing&mdash;singing,\\r\\n      if I may&mdash;the romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the\\r\\n      casks and striking them down into the hold, where once again leviathan\\r\\n      returns to his native profundities, sliding along beneath the surface as\\r\\n      before; but, alas! never more to rise and blow.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the six-barrel\\r\\n      casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling this way and\\r\\n      that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed round and headed\\r\\n      over, end for end, and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery\\r\\n      deck, like so many land slides, till at last man-handled and stayed in\\r\\n      their course; and all round the hoops, rap, rap, go as many hammers as can\\r\\n      play upon them, for now, <i>ex officio</i>, every sailor is a cooper.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the great\\r\\n      hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open, and down\\r\\n      go the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the hatches are\\r\\n      replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents\\r\\n      in all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream with freshets of\\r\\n      blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous masses of the whale&rsquo;s\\r\\n      head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie about, as in a brewery\\r\\n      yard; the smoke from the try-works has besooted all the bulwarks; the\\r\\n      mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the entire ship seems great\\r\\n      leviathan himself; while on all hands the din is deafening.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this\\r\\n      self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works, you\\r\\n      would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a most\\r\\n      scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a\\r\\n      singularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the decks never look\\r\\n      so white as just after what they call an affair of oil. Besides, from the\\r\\n      ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a potent lye is readily made; and\\r\\n      whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to\\r\\n      the side, that lye quickly exterminates it. Hands go diligently along the\\r\\n      bulwarks, and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their full\\r\\n      tidiness. The soot is brushed from the lower rigging. All the numerous\\r\\n      implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put\\r\\n      away. The great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try-works,\\r\\n      completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of sight; all tackles are\\r\\n      coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the combined and simultaneous industry\\r\\n      of almost the entire ship&rsquo;s company, the whole of this conscientious duty\\r\\n      is at last concluded, then the crew themselves proceed to their own\\r\\n      ablutions; shift themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the\\r\\n      immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from out\\r\\n      the daintiest Holland.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and\\r\\n      humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;\\r\\n      propose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object not to\\r\\n      taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to such\\r\\n      musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short of\\r\\n      audacity. They know not the thing you distantly allude to. Away, and bring\\r\\n      us napkins!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men intent on\\r\\n      spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will again soil the\\r\\n      old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small grease-spot somewhere.\\r\\n      Yes; and many is the time, when, after the severest uninterrupted labors,\\r\\n      which know no night; continuing straight through for ninety-six hours;\\r\\n      when from the boat, where they have swelled their wrists with all day\\r\\n      rowing on the Line,&mdash;they only step to the deck to carry vast chains,\\r\\n      and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and slash, yea, and in their very\\r\\n      sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the\\r\\n      equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works; when, on the heel of all\\r\\n      this, they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship, and make\\r\\n      a spotless dairy room of it; many is the time the poor fellows, just\\r\\n      buttoning the necks of their clean frocks, are startled by the cry of\\r\\n      &ldquo;There she blows!&rdquo; and away they fly to fight another whale, and go\\r\\n      through the whole weary thing again. Oh! my friends, but this is\\r\\n      man-killing! Yet this is life. For hardly have we mortals by long toilings\\r\\n      extracted from this world&rsquo;s vast bulk its small but valuable sperm; and\\r\\n      then, with weary patience, cleansed ourselves from its defilements, and\\r\\n      learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul; hardly is this\\r\\n      done, when&mdash;<i>There she blows!</i>&mdash;the ghost is spouted up, and away\\r\\n      we sail to fight some other world, and go through young life&rsquo;s old routine\\r\\n      again.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Oh! the metempsychosis!

The Doubloon.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,\\r\\n      taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in\\r\\n      the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added\\r\\n      how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood, he was\\r\\n      wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely eyeing the\\r\\n      particular object before him. When he halted before the binnacle, with his\\r\\n      glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass, that glance shot\\r\\n      like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose; and when\\r\\n      resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast, then, as the same\\r\\n      riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there, he still wore\\r\\n      the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a certain wild\\r\\n      longing, if not hopefulness.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly\\r\\n      attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as though\\r\\n      now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some\\r\\n      monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some certain\\r\\n      significance lurks in all things, else all things are little worth, and\\r\\n      the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell by the\\r\\n      cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass in the\\r\\n      Milky Way.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of the\\r\\n      heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands, the\\r\\n      head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst all the\\r\\n      rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet,\\r\\n      untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its Quito\\r\\n      glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by\\r\\n      ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick\\r\\n      darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless every\\r\\n      sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it was set\\r\\n      apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however wanton in their\\r\\n      sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale&rsquo;s\\r\\n      talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night,\\r\\n      wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever live to\\r\\n      spend it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun and\\r\\n      tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun&rsquo;s disks and\\r\\n      stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving, are in\\r\\n      luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems almost to\\r\\n      derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories, by passing through\\r\\n      those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example\\r\\n      of these things. On its round border it bore the letters, REPUBLICA DEL\\r\\n      ECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin came from a country planted in the\\r\\n      middle of the world, and beneath the great equator, and named after it;\\r\\n      and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the unwaning clime that knows\\r\\n      no autumn. Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three Andes&rsquo;\\r\\n      summits; from one a flame; a tower on another; on the third a crowing\\r\\n      cock; while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac, the\\r\\n      signs all marked with their usual cabalistics, and the keystone sun\\r\\n      entering the equinoctial point at Libra.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now\\r\\n      pausing.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and all\\r\\n      other grand and lofty things; look here,&mdash;three peaks as proud as\\r\\n      Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the\\r\\n      courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all\\r\\n      are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe,\\r\\n      which, like a magician&rsquo;s glass, to each and every man in turn but mirrors\\r\\n      back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for those who ask\\r\\n      the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks now this coined\\r\\n      sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the sign of storms, the\\r\\n      equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at\\r\\n      Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born in throes, &rsquo;tis fit that\\r\\n      man should live in pains and die in pangs! So be it, then! Here&rsquo;s stout\\r\\n      stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil&rsquo;s claws must have\\r\\n      left their mouldings there since yesterday,&rdquo; murmured Starbuck to himself,\\r\\n      leaning against the bulwarks. &ldquo;The old man seems to read Belshazzar&rsquo;s\\r\\n      awful writing. I have never marked the coin inspectingly. He goes below;\\r\\n      let me read. A dark valley between three mighty, heaven-abiding peaks,\\r\\n      that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint earthly symbol. So in this\\r\\n      vale of Death, God girds us round; and over all our gloom, the sun of\\r\\n      Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope. If we bend down our eyes,\\r\\n      the dark vale shows her mouldy soil; but if we lift them, the bright sun\\r\\n      meets our glance half way, to cheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture;\\r\\n      and if, at midnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we\\r\\n      gaze for him in vain! This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still\\r\\n      sadly to me. I will quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;There now&rsquo;s the old Mogul,&rdquo; soliloquized Stubb by the try-works, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s\\r\\n      been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and both with\\r\\n      faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long. And\\r\\n      all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I have it now on Negro Hill\\r\\n      or in Corlaer&rsquo;s Hook, I&rsquo;d not look at it very long ere spending it. Humph!\\r\\n      in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as queer. I have seen\\r\\n      doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons of old Spain, your\\r\\n      doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili, your doubloons of Bolivia,\\r\\n      your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles, and\\r\\n      joes, and half joes, and quarter joes. What then should there be in this\\r\\n      doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful? By Golconda! let me\\r\\n      read it once. Halloa! here&rsquo;s signs and wonders truly! That, now, is what\\r\\n      old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and what my almanac below\\r\\n      calls ditto. I&rsquo;ll get the almanac and as I have heard devils can be raised\\r\\n      with Daboll&rsquo;s arithmetic, I&rsquo;ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of\\r\\n      these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar. Here&rsquo;s the\\r\\n      book. Let&rsquo;s see now. Signs and wonders; and the sun, he&rsquo;s always among\\r\\n      &rsquo;em. Hem, hem, hem; here they are&mdash;here they go&mdash;all alive:&mdash;Aries,\\r\\n      or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and Jimimi! here&rsquo;s Gemini himself, or the\\r\\n      Twins. Well; the sun he wheels among &rsquo;em. Aye, here on the coin he&rsquo;s just\\r\\n      crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring.\\r\\n      Book! you lie there; the fact is, you books must know your places. You&rsquo;ll\\r\\n      do to give us the bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the\\r\\n      thoughts. That&rsquo;s my small experience, so far as the Massachusetts\\r\\n      calendar, and Bowditch&rsquo;s navigator, and Daboll&rsquo;s arithmetic go. Signs and\\r\\n      wonders, eh? Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant\\r\\n      in wonders! There&rsquo;s a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist&mdash;hark! By\\r\\n      Jove, I have it! Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man\\r\\n      in one round chapter; and now I&rsquo;ll read it off, straight out of the book.\\r\\n      Come, Almanack! To begin: there&rsquo;s Aries, or the Ram&mdash;lecherous dog,\\r\\n      he begets us; then, Taurus, or the Bull&mdash;he bumps us the first thing;\\r\\n      then Gemini, or the Twins&mdash;that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach\\r\\n      Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going\\r\\n      from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path&mdash;he gives a few\\r\\n      fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the\\r\\n      Virgin! that&rsquo;s our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye,\\r\\n      when pop comes Libra, or the Scales&mdash;happiness weighed and found\\r\\n      wanting; and while we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump,\\r\\n      as Scorpio, or the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the\\r\\n      wound, when whang come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer,\\r\\n      is amusing himself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here&rsquo;s the\\r\\n      battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing, and\\r\\n      headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours out his\\r\\n      whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we\\r\\n      sleep. There&rsquo;s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun goes through\\r\\n      it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty. Jollily he,\\r\\n      aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and so, alow here, does\\r\\n      jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly&rsquo;s the word for aye! Adieu, Doubloon! But stop; here\\r\\n      comes little King-Post; dodge round the try-works, now, and let&rsquo;s hear\\r\\n      what he&rsquo;ll have to say. There; he&rsquo;s before it; he&rsquo;ll out with something\\r\\n      presently. So, so; he&rsquo;s beginning.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises a\\r\\n      certain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, what&rsquo;s all this\\r\\n      staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that&rsquo;s true; and at two\\r\\n      cents the cigar, that&rsquo;s nine hundred and sixty cigars. I won&rsquo;t smoke dirty\\r\\n      pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here&rsquo;s nine hundred and sixty of\\r\\n      them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy &rsquo;em out.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a\\r\\n      foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of\\r\\n      wiseish look to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxman&mdash;the old\\r\\n      hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea. He\\r\\n      luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other side of\\r\\n      the mast; why, there&rsquo;s a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and now he&rsquo;s back\\r\\n      again; what does that mean? Hark! he&rsquo;s muttering&mdash;voice like an old\\r\\n      worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when the\\r\\n      sun stands in some one of these signs. I&rsquo;ve studied signs, and know their\\r\\n      marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old witch in\\r\\n      Copenhagen. Now, in what sign will the sun then be? The horse-shoe sign;\\r\\n      for there it is, right opposite the gold. And what&rsquo;s the horse-shoe sign?\\r\\n      The lion is the horse-shoe sign&mdash;the roaring and devouring lion.\\r\\n      Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another rendering now; but still one text. All sorts of men in\\r\\n      one kind of world, you see. Dodge again! here comes Queequeg&mdash;all\\r\\n      tattooing&mdash;looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself. What says the\\r\\n      Cannibal? As I live he&rsquo;s comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;\\r\\n      thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I\\r\\n      suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon&rsquo;s Astronomy in the back country.\\r\\n      And by Jove, he&rsquo;s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh&mdash;I\\r\\n      guess it&rsquo;s Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don&rsquo;t know what to make of\\r\\n      the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king&rsquo;s trowsers. But,\\r\\n      aside again! here comes that ghost-devil, Fedallah; tail coiled out of\\r\\n      sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual. What does he say,\\r\\n      with that look of his? Ah, only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself;\\r\\n      there is a sun on the coin&mdash;fire worshipper, depend upon it. Ho! more\\r\\n      and more. This way comes Pip&mdash;poor boy! would he had died, or I; he&rsquo;s\\r\\n      half horrible to me. He too has been watching all of these interpreters&mdash;myself\\r\\n      included&mdash;and look now, he comes to read, with that unearthly idiot\\r\\n      face. Stand away again and hear him. Hark!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Upon my soul, he&rsquo;s been studying Murray&rsquo;s Grammar!

There he stands; two\\r\\n      bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers, and two more poked into the\\r\\n      sleeves of an old jacket.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Wonder if he means me?&mdash;complimentary!&mdash;poor lad!&mdash;I could\\r\\n      go hang myself. Any way, for the present, I&rsquo;ll quit Pip&rsquo;s vicinity. I can\\r\\n      stand the rest, for they have plain wits; but he&rsquo;s too crazy-witty for my\\r\\n      sanity. So, so, I leave him muttering.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the ship&rsquo;s navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on fire to\\r\\n      unscrew it.

Then\\r\\n      again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when aught&rsquo;s nailed to the\\r\\n      mast it&rsquo;s a sign that things grow desperate. Ha, ha! old Ahab! the White\\r\\n      Whale; he&rsquo;ll nail ye! This is a pine tree. My father, in old Tolland\\r\\n      county, cut down a pine tree once, and found a silver ring grown over in\\r\\n      it; some old darkey&rsquo;s wedding ring. How did it get there? And so they&rsquo;ll\\r\\n      say in the resurrection, when they come to fish up this old mast, and find\\r\\n      a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark. Oh, the\\r\\n      gold! the precious, precious, gold! the green miser&rsquo;ll hoard ye soon!\\r\\n      Hish! hish! God goes &rsquo;mong the worlds blackberrying.

Leg and Arm.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <h3>\\r\\n      The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London.\\r\\n    </h3>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Ship, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours, bearing\\r\\n      down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was standing in his\\r\\n      hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger\\r\\n      captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat&rsquo;s bow. He was a\\r\\n      darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of sixty or\\r\\n      thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round him in\\r\\n      festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket streamed\\r\\n      behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar&rsquo;s surcoat.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Hast seen the White Whale?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;See you this?&rdquo; and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it, he\\r\\n      held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden head like\\r\\n      a mallet.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Man my boat!&rdquo; cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near\\r\\n      him&mdash;&ldquo;Stand by to lower!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his crew\\r\\n      were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the stranger. But\\r\\n      here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the excitement of the\\r\\n      moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never\\r\\n      once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own, and then it was\\r\\n      always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to\\r\\n      the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel\\r\\n      at a moment&rsquo;s warning. Now, it is no very easy matter for anybody&mdash;except\\r\\n      those who are almost hourly used to it, like whalemen&mdash;to clamber up\\r\\n      a ship&rsquo;s side from a boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift\\r\\n      the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it\\r\\n      half way down to the kelson. So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship\\r\\n      of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now\\r\\n      found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly\\r\\n      eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward\\r\\n      circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his\\r\\n      luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And in\\r\\n      the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the two\\r\\n      officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the perpendicular\\r\\n      ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a pair of\\r\\n      tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem to bethink\\r\\n      them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea\\r\\n      bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute, because the strange\\r\\n      captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood, cried out, &ldquo;I see, I\\r\\n      see!&mdash;avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing over the\\r\\n      cutting-tackle.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two\\r\\n      previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved\\r\\n      blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end. This was\\r\\n      quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his\\r\\n      solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting in the\\r\\n      fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the\\r\\n      word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to hoist his own\\r\\n      weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of the\\r\\n      tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and gently\\r\\n      landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in\\r\\n      welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg,\\r\\n      and crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his\\r\\n      walrus way, &ldquo;Aye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!&mdash;an arm\\r\\n      and a leg!&mdash;an arm that never can shrink, d&rsquo;ye see; and a leg that\\r\\n      never can run. Where did&rsquo;st thou see the White Whale?&mdash;how long ago?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The White Whale,&rdquo; said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards the\\r\\n      East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a telescope;\\r\\n      &ldquo;there I saw him, on the Line, last season.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And he took that arm off, did he?&rdquo; asked Ahab, now sliding down from the\\r\\n      capstan, and resting on the Englishman&rsquo;s shoulder, as he did so.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Spin me the yarn,&rdquo; said Ahab; &ldquo;how was it?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,&rdquo; began\\r\\n      the Englishman. &ldquo;I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time. Well, one\\r\\n      day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat fastened to\\r\\n      one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went milling and\\r\\n      milling round so, that my boat&rsquo;s crew could only trim dish, by sitting all\\r\\n      their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches from the bottom\\r\\n      of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white head and hump, all\\r\\n      crows&rsquo; feet and wrinkles.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;It was he, it was he!&rdquo; cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended\\r\\n      breath.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, aye&mdash;they were mine&mdash;<i>my</i> irons,&rdquo; cried Ahab, exultingly&mdash;&ldquo;but\\r\\n      on!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Give me a chance, then,&rdquo; said the Englishman, good-humoredly. &ldquo;Well, this\\r\\n      old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all afoam into\\r\\n      the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, I see!&mdash;wanted to part it; free the fast-fish&mdash;an old\\r\\n      trick&mdash;I know him.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;How it was exactly,&rdquo; continued the one-armed commander, &ldquo;I do not know;\\r\\n      but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there somehow;\\r\\n      but we didn&rsquo;t know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled on the line,\\r\\n      bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other whale&rsquo;s; that\\r\\n      went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters stood, and what a\\r\\n      noble great whale it was&mdash;the noblest and biggest I ever saw, sir, in\\r\\n      my life&mdash;I resolved to capture him, spite of the boiling rage he\\r\\n      seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would get loose, or the\\r\\n      tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a devil of a boat&rsquo;s crew\\r\\n      for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my\\r\\n      first mate&rsquo;s boat&mdash;Mr. Mounttop&rsquo;s here (by the way, Captain&mdash;Mounttop;\\r\\n      Mounttop&mdash;the captain);&mdash;as I was saying, I jumped into\\r\\n      Mounttop&rsquo;s boat, which, d&rsquo;ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then;\\r\\n      and snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it.\\r\\n      But, Lord, look you, sir&mdash;hearts and souls alive, man&mdash;the next\\r\\n      instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat&mdash;both eyes out&mdash;all\\r\\n      befogged and bedeadened with black foam&mdash;the whale&rsquo;s tail looming\\r\\n      straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple. No\\r\\n      use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding\\r\\n      sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second iron, to\\r\\n      toss it overboard&mdash;down comes the tail like a Lima tower, cutting my\\r\\n      boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes first, the white\\r\\n      hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all chips. We all struck\\r\\n      out. To escape his terrible flailings, I seized hold of my harpoon-pole\\r\\n      sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish. But a\\r\\n      combing sea dashed me off, and at the same instant, the fish, taking one\\r\\n      good dart forwards, went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed\\r\\n      second iron towing along near me caught me here&rdquo; (clapping his hand just\\r\\n      below his shoulder); &ldquo;yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to\\r\\n      Hell&rsquo;s flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good\\r\\n      God, the barb ript its way along the flesh&mdash;clear along the whole\\r\\n      length of my arm&mdash;came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;&mdash;and\\r\\n      that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by the way, captain&mdash;Dr.\\r\\n      Bunger, ship&rsquo;s surgeon: Bunger, my lad,&mdash;the captain). Now, Bunger\\r\\n      boy, spin your part of the yarn.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all the\\r\\n      time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote his\\r\\n      gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but sober\\r\\n      one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched\\r\\n      trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between a\\r\\n      marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other,\\r\\n      occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two\\r\\n      crippled captains. But, at his superior&rsquo;s introduction of him to Ahab, he\\r\\n      politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain&rsquo;s bidding.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;It was a shocking bad wound,&rdquo; began the whale-surgeon; &ldquo;and, taking my\\r\\n      advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy&mdash;&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship,&rdquo; interrupted the one-armed\\r\\n      captain, addressing Ahab; &ldquo;go on, boy.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing hot\\r\\n      weather there on the Line. But it was no use&mdash;I did all I could; sat\\r\\n      up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of diet&mdash;&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oh, very severe!&rdquo; chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly altering\\r\\n      his voice, &ldquo;Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till he couldn&rsquo;t\\r\\n      see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed, half seas over, about\\r\\n      three o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up with me indeed, and\\r\\n      was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great watcher, and very dietetically\\r\\n      severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog, laugh out! why don&rsquo;t ye? You know\\r\\n      you&rsquo;re a precious jolly rascal.) But, heave ahead, boy, I&rsquo;d rather be\\r\\n      killed by you than kept alive by any other man.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir&rdquo;&mdash;said\\r\\n      the imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab&mdash;&ldquo;is\\r\\n      apt to be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that sort.\\r\\n      But I may as well say&mdash;en passant, as the French remark&mdash;that I\\r\\n      myself&mdash;that is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergy&mdash;am\\r\\n      a strict total abstinence man; I never drink&mdash;&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Water!&rdquo; cried the captain; &ldquo;he never drinks it; it&rsquo;s a sort of fits to\\r\\n      him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on&mdash;go on\\r\\n      with the arm story.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Yes, I may as well,&rdquo; said the surgeon, coolly. &ldquo;I was about observing,\\r\\n      sir, before Captain Boomer&rsquo;s facetious interruption, that spite of my best\\r\\n      and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse; the truth\\r\\n      was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw; more than two\\r\\n      feet and several inches long. I measured it with the lead line. In short,\\r\\n      it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it came. But I had no\\r\\n      hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is against all rule&rdquo;&mdash;pointing\\r\\n      at it with the marlingspike&mdash;&ldquo;that is the captain&rsquo;s work, not mine;\\r\\n      he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to\\r\\n      the end, to knock some one&rsquo;s brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine\\r\\n      once. He flies into diabolical passions sometimes. Do ye see this dent,\\r\\n      sir&rdquo;&mdash;removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and exposing a\\r\\n      bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the slightest scarry\\r\\n      trace, or any token of ever having been a wound&mdash;&ldquo;Well, the captain\\r\\n      there will tell you how that came here; he knows.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;but his mother did; he was born with it.\\r\\n      Oh, you solemn rogue, you&mdash;you Bunger! was there ever such another\\r\\n      Bunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in\\r\\n      pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What became of the White Whale?&rdquo; now cried Ahab, who thus far had been\\r\\n      impatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried the one-armed captain, &ldquo;oh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we\\r\\n      didn&rsquo;t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I didn&rsquo;t\\r\\n      then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick, till some\\r\\n      time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about Moby Dick&mdash;as\\r\\n      some call him&mdash;and then I knew it was he.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Did&rsquo;st thou cross his wake again?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Twice.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;But could not fasten?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t want to try to: ain&rsquo;t one limb enough? What should I do without\\r\\n      this other arm? And I&rsquo;m thinking Moby Dick doesn&rsquo;t bite so much as he\\r\\n      swallows.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; interrupted Bunger, &ldquo;give him your left arm for bait to get\\r\\n      the right. Do you know, gentlemen&rdquo;&mdash;very gravely and mathematically\\r\\n      bowing to each Captain in succession&mdash;&ldquo;Do you know, gentlemen, that\\r\\n      the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine\\r\\n      Providence, that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even\\r\\n      a man&rsquo;s arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take for the White\\r\\n      Whale&rsquo;s malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means to swallow a\\r\\n      single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But sometimes he is like\\r\\n      the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making\\r\\n      believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him in\\r\\n      good earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I gave\\r\\n      him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d&rsquo;ye see. No possible\\r\\n      way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his\\r\\n      general bodily system. Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about\\r\\n      it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of\\r\\n      giving decent burial to the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only\\r\\n      let the whale have another chance at you shortly, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;No, thank ye, Bunger,&rdquo; said the English Captain, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s welcome to the arm\\r\\n      he has, since I can&rsquo;t help it, and didn&rsquo;t know him then; but not to\\r\\n      another one. No more White Whales for me; I&rsquo;ve lowered for him once, and\\r\\n      that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I know\\r\\n      that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark ye,\\r\\n      he&rsquo;s best let alone; don&rsquo;t you think so, Captain?&rdquo;&mdash;glancing at the\\r\\n      ivory leg.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let alone,\\r\\n      that accursed thing is not always what least allures. He&rsquo;s all a magnet!\\r\\n      How long since thou saw&rsquo;st him last? Which way heading?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend&rsquo;s,&rdquo; cried Bunger, stoopingly\\r\\n      walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; &ldquo;this man&rsquo;s blood&mdash;bring\\r\\n      the thermometer!&mdash;it&rsquo;s at the boiling point!&mdash;his pulse makes\\r\\n      these planks beat!&mdash;sir!&rdquo;&mdash;taking a lancet from his pocket, and\\r\\n      drawing near to Ahab&rsquo;s arm.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Avast!&rdquo; roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks&mdash;&ldquo;Man the\\r\\n      boat! Which way heading?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.\\r\\n      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? He was heading east, I think.&mdash;Is your Captain\\r\\n      crazy?&rdquo; whispering Fedallah.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to take\\r\\n      the boat&rsquo;s steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle towards\\r\\n      him, commanded the ship&rsquo;s sailors to stand by to lower.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In a moment he was standing in the boat&rsquo;s stern, and the Manilla men were\\r\\n      springing to their oars. In vain the English Captain hailed him. With back\\r\\n      to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own, Ahab stood\\r\\n      upright till alongside of the Pequod.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0101\" id=\"link2HCH0101\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 101. The Decanter.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she\\r\\n      hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby, merchant\\r\\n      of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of Enderby &amp;\\r\\n      Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman&rsquo;s opinion, comes not far behind\\r\\n      the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point of real\\r\\n      historical interest. How long, prior to the year of our Lord 1775, this\\r\\n      great whaling house was in existence, my numerous fish-documents do not\\r\\n      make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out the first English ships\\r\\n      that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale; though for some score of years\\r\\n      previous (ever since 1726) our valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and\\r\\n      the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued that Leviathan, but only in the\\r\\n      North and South Atlantic: not elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here,\\r\\n      that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with\\r\\n      civilized steel the great Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they\\r\\n      were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose, and\\r\\n      at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape Horn, and\\r\\n      was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any sort in the\\r\\n      great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one; and returning to\\r\\n      her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm, the Amelia&rsquo;s example\\r\\n      was soon followed by other ships, English and American, and thus the vast\\r\\n      Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open. But not content with\\r\\n      this good deed, the indefatigable house again bestirred itself: Samuel and\\r\\n      all his Sons&mdash;how many, their mother only knows&mdash;and under their\\r\\n      immediate auspices, and partly, I think, at their expense, the British\\r\\n      government was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling\\r\\n      voyage of discovery into the South Sea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain,\\r\\n      the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it, and did some service; how much\\r\\n      does not appear. But this is not all. In 1819, the same house fitted out a\\r\\n      discovery whale ship of their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote\\r\\n      waters of Japan. That ship&mdash;well called the &ldquo;Syren&rdquo;&mdash;made a\\r\\n      noble experimental cruise; and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling\\r\\n      Ground first became generally known. The Syren in this famous voyage was\\r\\n      commanded by a Captain Coffin, a Nantucketer.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      All honor to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to\\r\\n      the present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have\\r\\n      slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a very fast\\r\\n      sailer and a noble craft every way. I boarded her once at midnight\\r\\n      somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the\\r\\n      forecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps&mdash;every\\r\\n      soul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And that fine gam\\r\\n      I had&mdash;long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his\\r\\n      ivory heel&mdash;it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of\\r\\n      that ship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I\\r\\n      ever lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it\\r\\n      at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it&rsquo;s\\r\\n      squally off there by Patagonia), and all hands&mdash;visitors and all&mdash;were\\r\\n      called to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each\\r\\n      other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our\\r\\n      jackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the howling\\r\\n      gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts did not go\\r\\n      overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we had to pass\\r\\n      the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle\\r\\n      scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The beef was fine&mdash;tough, but with body in it. They said it was\\r\\n      bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for\\r\\n      certain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial,\\r\\n      symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that you\\r\\n      could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were swallowed. If\\r\\n      you stooped over too far forward, you risked their pitching out of you\\r\\n      like billiard-balls. The bread&mdash;but that couldn&rsquo;t be helped; besides,\\r\\n      it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the bread contained the only fresh\\r\\n      fare they had. But the forecastle was not very light, and it was very easy\\r\\n      to step over into a dark corner when you ate it. But all in all, taking\\r\\n      her from truck to helm, considering the dimensions of the cook&rsquo;s boilers,\\r\\n      including his own live parchment boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel\\r\\n      Enderby was a jolly ship; of good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong;\\r\\n      crack fellows all, and capital from boot heels to hat-band.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other English\\r\\n      whalers I know of&mdash;not all though&mdash;were such famous, hospitable\\r\\n      ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the\\r\\n      joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I\\r\\n      will tell you. The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is matter\\r\\n      for historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of historical\\r\\n      whale research, when it has seemed needed.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,\\r\\n      Zealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant in\\r\\n      the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching plenty\\r\\n      to eat and drink. For, as a general thing, the English merchant-ship\\r\\n      scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence, in the English,\\r\\n      this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural, but incidental\\r\\n      and particular; and, therefore, must have some special origin, which is\\r\\n      here pointed out, and will be still further elucidated.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an\\r\\n      ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew must\\r\\n      be about whalers. The title was, &ldquo;Dan Coopman,&rdquo; wherefore I concluded that\\r\\n      this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the\\r\\n      fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was reinforced in\\r\\n      this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one &ldquo;Fitz\\r\\n      Swackhammer.&rdquo; But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man, professor of\\r\\n      Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus and St. Pott&rsquo;s, to\\r\\n      whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a box of sperm candles\\r\\n      for his trouble&mdash;this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he spied the\\r\\n      book, assured me that &ldquo;Dan Coopman&rdquo; did not mean &ldquo;The Cooper,&rdquo; but &ldquo;The\\r\\n      Merchant.&rdquo; In short, this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of\\r\\n      the commerce of Holland; and, among other subjects, contained a very\\r\\n      interesting account of its whale fishery. And in this chapter it was,\\r\\n      headed, &ldquo;Smeer,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Fat,&rdquo; that I found a long detailed list of the\\r\\n      outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from\\r\\n      which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead, I transcribe the following:\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock\\r\\n      fish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins of\\r\\n      butter. 20,000 lbs. Texel &amp; Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese\\r\\n      (probably an inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels of\\r\\n      beer.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in the\\r\\n      present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole pipes,\\r\\n      barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this\\r\\n      beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were\\r\\n      incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and Platonic\\r\\n      application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary tables of my own,\\r\\n      touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by every Low\\r\\n      Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen whale fishery.\\r\\n      In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and Leyden cheese\\r\\n      consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their naturally unctuous\\r\\n      natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their\\r\\n      vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid\\r\\n      Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the\\r\\n      convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those\\r\\n      polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that\\r\\n      climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,\\r\\n      including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not much\\r\\n      exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of\\r\\n      180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I say, we have\\r\\n      precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks&rsquo; allowance,\\r\\n      exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin. Now, whether\\r\\n      these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might fancy them to have\\r\\n      been, were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat&rsquo;s head, and take\\r\\n      good aim at flying whales; this would seem somewhat improbable. Yet they\\r\\n      did aim at them, and hit them too. But this was very far North, be it\\r\\n      remembered, where beer agrees well with the constitution; upon the\\r\\n      Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would be apt to make the harpooneer\\r\\n      sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his boat; and grievous loss might\\r\\n      ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of\\r\\n      two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English whalers\\r\\n      have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when cruising\\r\\n      in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of the world, get a\\r\\n      good dinner out of it, at least. And this empties the decanter.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0102\" id=\"link2HCH0102\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 102. A Bower in the Arsacides.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly\\r\\n      dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail\\r\\n      upon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough\\r\\n      sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still\\r\\n      further, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters, and\\r\\n      casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones,\\r\\n      set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional\\r\\n      skeleton.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the fishery,\\r\\n      pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale? Did\\r\\n      erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures on the anatomy\\r\\n      of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a specimen rib for\\r\\n      exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a full-grown whale on\\r\\n      your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a roast-pig? Surely not. A\\r\\n      veritable witness have you hitherto been, Ishmael; but have a care how you\\r\\n      seize the privilege of Jonah alone; the privilege of discoursing upon the\\r\\n      joists and beams; the rafters, ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings,\\r\\n      making up the frame-work of leviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats,\\r\\n      dairy-rooms, butteries, and cheeseries in his bowels.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath\\r\\n      the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been blessed with an\\r\\n      opportunity to dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged to, a small\\r\\n      cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag,\\r\\n      to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the heads of the\\r\\n      lances. Think you I let that chance go, without using my boat-hatchet and\\r\\n      jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading all the contents of that\\r\\n      young cub?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their\\r\\n      gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted to\\r\\n      my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides. For\\r\\n      being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey of\\r\\n      Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with the\\r\\n      lord of Tranque, at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen not\\r\\n      very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his capital.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted\\r\\n      with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought together\\r\\n      in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could\\r\\n      invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices, chiselled shells,\\r\\n      inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes; and all these distributed\\r\\n      among whatever natural wonders, the wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering\\r\\n      waves had cast upon his shores.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an\\r\\n      unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his\\r\\n      head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings seemed\\r\\n      his verdant jet. When the vast body had at last been stripped of its\\r\\n      fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun, then the\\r\\n      skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen, where a grand\\r\\n      temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebrÃ¦ were carved with\\r\\n      Arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests\\r\\n      kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head again\\r\\n      sent forth its vapory spout; while, suspended from a bough, the terrific\\r\\n      lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like the hair-hung sword that so\\r\\n      affrighted Damocles.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen; the\\r\\n      trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the industrious\\r\\n      earth beneath was as a weaver&rsquo;s loom, with a gorgeous carpet on it,\\r\\n      whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and woof, and the living\\r\\n      flowers the figures. All the trees, with all their laden branches; all the\\r\\n      shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the message-carrying air; all these\\r\\n      unceasingly were active. Through the lacings of the leaves, the great sun\\r\\n      seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver!\\r\\n      unseen weaver!&mdash;pause!&mdash;one word!&mdash;whither flows the\\r\\n      fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all these ceaseless toilings?\\r\\n      Speak, weaver!&mdash;stay thy hand!&mdash;but one single word with thee!\\r\\n      Nay&mdash;the shuttle flies&mdash;the figures float from forth the loom;\\r\\n      the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god, he\\r\\n      weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal voice;\\r\\n      and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened; and only\\r\\n      when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it.\\r\\n      For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken words that are\\r\\n      inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words are plainly heard\\r\\n      without the walls, bursting from the opened casements. Thereby have\\r\\n      villainies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in all\\r\\n      this din of the great world&rsquo;s loom, thy subtlest thinkings may be\\r\\n      overheard afar.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the\\r\\n      great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging&mdash;a gigantic idler!\\r\\n      Yet, as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around\\r\\n      him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven over\\r\\n      with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but himself\\r\\n      a skeleton. Life folded Death; Death trellised Life; the grim god wived\\r\\n      with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the\\r\\n      skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet\\r\\n      had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object\\r\\n      of vertu. He laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests should swear\\r\\n      that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced before this skeleton&mdash;brushed\\r\\n      the vines aside&mdash;broke through the ribs&mdash;and with a ball of\\r\\n      Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid its many winding, shaded\\r\\n      colonnades and arbours. But soon my line was out; and following it back, I\\r\\n      emerged from the opening where I entered. I saw no living thing within;\\r\\n      naught was there but bones.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the skeleton.\\r\\n      From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me taking the\\r\\n      altitude of the final rib, &ldquo;How now!&rdquo; they shouted; &ldquo;Dar&rsquo;st thou measure\\r\\n      this our god! That&rsquo;s for us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Aye, priests&mdash;well, how long do ye\\r\\n      make him, then?&rdquo; But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them, concerning\\r\\n      feet and inches; they cracked each other&rsquo;s sconces with their yard-sticks&mdash;the\\r\\n      great skull echoed&mdash;and seizing that lucky chance, I quickly\\r\\n      concluded my own admeasurements.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      These admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be it\\r\\n      recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied\\r\\n      measurement I please. Because there are skeleton authorities you can refer\\r\\n      to, to test my accuracy. There is a Leviathanic Museum, they tell me, in\\r\\n      Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that country, where they have\\r\\n      some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales. Likewise, I have heard\\r\\n      that in the museum of Manchester, in New Hampshire, they have what the\\r\\n      proprietors call &ldquo;the only perfect specimen of a Greenland or River Whale\\r\\n      in the United States.&rdquo; Moreover, at a place in Yorkshire, England, Burton\\r\\n      Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession\\r\\n      the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size, by no means of the\\r\\n      full-grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo&rsquo;s.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged,\\r\\n      were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds. King\\r\\n      Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir Clifford, because he was\\r\\n      lord of the seignories of those parts. Sir Clifford&rsquo;s whale has been\\r\\n      articulated throughout; so that, like a great chest of drawers, you can\\r\\n      open and shut him, in all his bony cavities&mdash;spread out his ribs like\\r\\n      a gigantic fan&mdash;and swing all day upon his lower jaw. Locks are to be\\r\\n      put upon some of his trap-doors and shutters; and a footman will show\\r\\n      round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side. Sir Clifford\\r\\n      thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the\\r\\n      spinal column; threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his\\r\\n      cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied\\r\\n      verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild\\r\\n      wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving\\r\\n      such valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for space, and wished the\\r\\n      other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then\\r\\n      composing&mdash;at least, what untattooed parts might remain&mdash;I did\\r\\n      not trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all\\r\\n      enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0103\" id=\"link2HCH0103\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 103. Measurement of The Whale&rsquo;s Skeleton.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain\\r\\n      statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton we\\r\\n      are briefly to exhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base\\r\\n      upon Captain Scoresby&rsquo;s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized\\r\\n      Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful\\r\\n      calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between\\r\\n      eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty feet\\r\\n      in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least ninety\\r\\n      tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would considerably\\r\\n      outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one\\r\\n      hundred inhabitants.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to this\\r\\n      leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman&rsquo;s imagination?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole, jaw,\\r\\n      teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now simply\\r\\n      point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed\\r\\n      bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of\\r\\n      the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the most complicated\\r\\n      part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter, you\\r\\n      must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under your arm, as we proceed,\\r\\n      otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we\\r\\n      are about to view.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In length, the Sperm Whale&rsquo;s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two\\r\\n      feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have been\\r\\n      ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one fifth in\\r\\n      length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two feet, his skull\\r\\n      and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of plain\\r\\n      back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less than a third of\\r\\n      its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his\\r\\n      vitals.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,\\r\\n      extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled the\\r\\n      hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some twenty of\\r\\n      her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise, for the time,\\r\\n      but a long, disconnected timber.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was nearly\\r\\n      six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each successively\\r\\n      longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one of the middle\\r\\n      ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From that part, the\\r\\n      remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only spanned five feet\\r\\n      and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore a seemly\\r\\n      correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most arched. In\\r\\n      some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath\\r\\n      bridges over small streams.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the\\r\\n      circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the\\r\\n      whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of the\\r\\n      Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the fish\\r\\n      which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of the\\r\\n      invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen\\r\\n      feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight\\r\\n      feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living\\r\\n      magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I now saw but a naked\\r\\n      spine, all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in\\r\\n      flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for the ample fins, I here\\r\\n      saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of the weighty and majestic,\\r\\n      but boneless flukes, an utter blank!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try to\\r\\n      comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his dead\\r\\n      attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in the\\r\\n      heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his angry\\r\\n      flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully invested whale\\r\\n      be truly and livingly found out.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a crane,\\r\\n      to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now it&rsquo;s done,\\r\\n      it looks much like Pompey&rsquo;s Pillar.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      There are forty and odd vertebrÃ¦ in all, which in the skeleton are not\\r\\n      locked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a Gothic\\r\\n      spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest, a middle one,\\r\\n      is in width something less than three feet, and in depth more than four.\\r\\n      The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the tail, is only two\\r\\n      inches in width, and looks something like a white billiard-ball. I was\\r\\n      told that there were still smaller ones, but they had been lost by some\\r\\n      little cannibal urchins, the priest&rsquo;s children, who had stolen them to\\r\\n      play marbles with. Thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of\\r\\n      living things tapers off at last into simple child&rsquo;s play.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0104\" id=\"link2HCH0104\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 104. The Fossil Whale.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to\\r\\n      enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not\\r\\n      compress him. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial\\r\\n      folio. Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and the\\r\\n      yards he measures about the waist; only think of the gigantic involutions\\r\\n      of his intestines, where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers\\r\\n      coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a line-of-battle-ship.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me to\\r\\n      approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not overlooking\\r\\n      the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him out to the\\r\\n      uttermost coil of his bowels. Having already described him in most of his\\r\\n      present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it now remains to magnify\\r\\n      him in an archÃ¦ological, fossiliferous, and antediluvian point of view.\\r\\n      Applied to any other creature than the Leviathan&mdash;to an ant or a flea&mdash;such\\r\\n      portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent. But when\\r\\n      Leviathan is the text, the case is altered. Fain am I to stagger to this\\r\\n      emprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary. And here be it said,\\r\\n      that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these\\r\\n      dissertations, I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson,\\r\\n      expressly purchased for that purpose; because that famous lexicographer&rsquo;s\\r\\n      uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by\\r\\n      a whale author like me.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject, though\\r\\n      it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing of this\\r\\n      Leviathan? Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals.\\r\\n      Give me a condor&rsquo;s quill! Give me Vesuvius&rsquo; crater for an inkstand!\\r\\n      Friends, hold my arms! For in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this\\r\\n      Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their outreaching\\r\\n      comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole circle of the\\r\\n      sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and mastodons, past,\\r\\n      present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth,\\r\\n      and throughout the whole universe, not excluding its suburbs. Such, and so\\r\\n      magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal theme! We expand to its\\r\\n      bulk. To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme. No great\\r\\n      and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea, though many there be\\r\\n      who have tried it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my credentials\\r\\n      as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been a\\r\\n      stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches, canals and wells,\\r\\n      wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by way of\\r\\n      preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while in the earlier\\r\\n      geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost\\r\\n      completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what are called\\r\\n      the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate intercepted\\r\\n      links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose remote\\r\\n      posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales hitherto\\r\\n      discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the last preceding the\\r\\n      superficial formations. And though none of them precisely answer to any\\r\\n      known species of the present time, they are yet sufficiently akin to them\\r\\n      in general respects, to justify their taking rank as Cetacean fossils.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones\\r\\n      and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals, been\\r\\n      found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England, in\\r\\n      Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Among\\r\\n      the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the year\\r\\n      1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris, a short street opening\\r\\n      almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones disinterred in\\r\\n      excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon&rsquo;s time. Cuvier\\r\\n      pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown\\r\\n      Leviathanic species.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost\\r\\n      complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842, on\\r\\n      the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-stricken credulous\\r\\n      slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels.\\r\\n      The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and bestowed upon it the\\r\\n      name of Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones of it being taken across the\\r\\n      sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it turned out that this alleged\\r\\n      reptile was a whale, though of a departed species. A significant\\r\\n      illustration of the fact, again and again repeated in this book, that the\\r\\n      skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully\\r\\n      invested body. So Owen rechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his\\r\\n      paper read before the London Geological Society, pronounced it, in\\r\\n      substance, one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of\\r\\n      the globe have blotted out of existence.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks, jaws,\\r\\n      ribs, and vertebrÃ¦, all characterized by partial resemblances to the\\r\\n      existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on the other\\r\\n      hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical Leviathans, their\\r\\n      incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back to that wondrous\\r\\n      period, ere time itself can be said to have begun; for time began with\\r\\n      man. Here Saturn&rsquo;s grey chaos rolls over me, and I obtain dim, shuddering\\r\\n      glimpses into those Polar eternities; when wedged bastions of ice pressed\\r\\n      hard upon what are now the Tropics; and in all the 25,000 miles of this\\r\\n      world&rsquo;s circumference, not an inhabitable hand&rsquo;s breadth of land was\\r\\n      visible. Then the whole world was the whale&rsquo;s; and, king of creation, he\\r\\n      left his wake along the present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs. Who\\r\\n      can show a pedigree like Leviathan? Ahab&rsquo;s harpoon had shed older blood\\r\\n      than the Pharaoh&rsquo;s. Methuselah seems a school-boy. I look round to shake\\r\\n      hands with Shem. I am horror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced\\r\\n      existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been\\r\\n      before all time, must needs exist after all humane ages are over.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the\\r\\n      stereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his\\r\\n      ancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim\\r\\n      for them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable print\\r\\n      of his fin. In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah, some fifty\\r\\n      years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and\\r\\n      painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins, and dolphins,\\r\\n      similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns.\\r\\n      Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore; was there swimming in\\r\\n      that planisphere, centuries before Solomon was cradled.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of\\r\\n      the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as set down by the\\r\\n      venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams of\\r\\n      which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are\\r\\n      oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore. The Common People imagine, that\\r\\n      by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the Temple, no Whale can pass it\\r\\n      without immediate death. But the truth of the Matter is, that on either\\r\\n      side of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea, and\\r\\n      wound the Whales when they light upon &rsquo;em. They keep a Whale&rsquo;s Rib of an\\r\\n      incredible length for a Miracle, which lying upon the Ground with its\\r\\n      convex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the Head of which cannot be reached\\r\\n      by a Man upon a Camel&rsquo;s Back. This Rib (says John Leo) is said to have\\r\\n      layn there a hundred Years before I saw it. Their Historians affirm, that\\r\\n      a Prophet who prophesy&rsquo;d of Mahomet, came from this Temple, and some do\\r\\n      not stand to assert, that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at\\r\\n      the Base of the Temple.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be a\\r\\n      Nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0105\" id=\"link2HCH0105\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 105. Does the Whale&rsquo;s Magnitude Diminish?&mdash;Will He Perish?\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the\\r\\n      head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether, in the\\r\\n      long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from the original\\r\\n      bulk of his sires.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the\\r\\n      present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found\\r\\n      in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period prior to\\r\\n      man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those belonging to\\r\\n      its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the\\r\\n      Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than seventy\\r\\n      feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen, that the\\r\\n      tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized\\r\\n      modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemen&rsquo;s authority, that Sperm Whales\\r\\n      have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an\\r\\n      advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may it\\r\\n      not be, that since Adam&rsquo;s time they have degenerated?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such\\r\\n      gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For Pliny tells\\r\\n      us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus of others\\r\\n      which measured eight hundred feet in length&mdash;Rope Walks and Thames\\r\\n      Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and Solander, Cooke&rsquo;s\\r\\n      naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting\\r\\n      down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one\\r\\n      hundred and twenty yards; that is, three hundred and sixty feet. And\\r\\n      LacÃ©pÃ¨de, the French naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales, in\\r\\n      the very beginning of his work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale at one\\r\\n      hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet. And this work was\\r\\n      published so late as A.D. 1825.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is as\\r\\n      big as his ancestors in Pliny&rsquo;s time. And if ever I go where Pliny is, I,\\r\\n      a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so. Because I\\r\\n      cannot understand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies that were\\r\\n      buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not measure so\\r\\n      much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks; and while the\\r\\n      cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh\\r\\n      tablets, by the relative proportions in which they are drawn, just as\\r\\n      plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield,\\r\\n      not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh&rsquo;s fat\\r\\n      kine; in the face of all this, I will not admit that of all animals the\\r\\n      whale alone should have degenerated.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more\\r\\n      recondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient look-outs\\r\\n      at the mast-heads of the whale-ships, now penetrating even through\\r\\n      Behring&rsquo;s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the\\r\\n      world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental\\r\\n      coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a\\r\\n      chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not at last be\\r\\n      exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the last man, smoke\\r\\n      his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final puff.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,\\r\\n      which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the prairies\\r\\n      of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and scowled with\\r\\n      their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous river-capitals,\\r\\n      where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch; in such a\\r\\n      comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished, to show that the\\r\\n      hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a period\\r\\n      ago&mdash;not a good lifetime&mdash;the census of the buffalo in Illinois\\r\\n      exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present day\\r\\n      not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the\\r\\n      cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far\\r\\n      different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an\\r\\n      end to the Leviathan. Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for\\r\\n      forty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank God, if\\r\\n      at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the days of the\\r\\n      old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West, when the far\\r\\n      west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness and a virgin, the\\r\\n      same number of moccasined men, for the same number of months, mounted on\\r\\n      horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain not forty, but forty\\r\\n      thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need were, could be\\r\\n      statistically stated.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual\\r\\n      extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former years (the\\r\\n      latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in small pods,\\r\\n      were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in consequence, the\\r\\n      voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more remunerative.\\r\\n      Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales, influenced by some\\r\\n      views to safety, now swim the seas in immense caravans, so that to a large\\r\\n      degree the scattered solitaries, yokes, and pods, and schools of other\\r\\n      days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated, unfrequent armies.\\r\\n      That is all. And equally fallacious seems the conceit, that because the\\r\\n      so-called whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years\\r\\n      abounding with them, hence that species also is declining. For they are\\r\\n      only being driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no longer\\r\\n      enlivened with their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand\\r\\n      has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two\\r\\n      firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain\\r\\n      impregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty Swiss\\r\\n      have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the savannas and glades\\r\\n      of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at last resort to their\\r\\n      Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls\\r\\n      there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a charmed circle of\\r\\n      everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit from man.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one\\r\\n      cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this\\r\\n      positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions. But\\r\\n      though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than 13,000,\\r\\n      have been annually slain on the nor&rsquo; west coast by the Americans alone;\\r\\n      yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little\\r\\n      or no account as an opposing argument in this matter.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of\\r\\n      the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to Harto,\\r\\n      the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the King of\\r\\n      Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are numerous as\\r\\n      droves of cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems no reason to\\r\\n      doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted for thousands of\\r\\n      years, by Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all the successive\\r\\n      monarchs of the East&mdash;if they still survive there in great numbers,\\r\\n      much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since he has a pasture\\r\\n      to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as all Asia, both\\r\\n      Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the Isles of the sea\\r\\n      combined.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity of\\r\\n      whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more, therefore\\r\\n      at any one period of time, several distinct adult generations must be\\r\\n      contemporary. And what that is, we may soon gain some idea of, by\\r\\n      imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and family vaults of creation\\r\\n      yielding up the live bodies of all the men, women, and children who were\\r\\n      alive seventy-five years ago; and adding this countless host to the\\r\\n      present human population of the globe.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his\\r\\n      species, however perishable in his individuality. He swam the seas before\\r\\n      the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the Tuileries,\\r\\n      and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin. In Noah&rsquo;s flood he despised Noah&rsquo;s\\r\\n      Ark; and if ever the world is to be again flooded, like the Netherlands,\\r\\n      to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will still survive, and\\r\\n      rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood, spout his frothed\\r\\n      defiance to the skies.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0106\" id=\"link2HCH0106\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 106. Ahab&rsquo;s Leg.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel\\r\\n      Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence to his\\r\\n      own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that\\r\\n      his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. And when after\\r\\n      gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so vehemently\\r\\n      wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman (it was, as ever,\\r\\n      something about his not steering inflexibly enough); then, the already\\r\\n      shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench, that though it\\r\\n      still remained entire, and to all appearances lusty, yet Ahab did not deem\\r\\n      it entirely trustworthy.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his\\r\\n      pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to the\\r\\n      condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. For it had not\\r\\n      been very long prior to the Pequod&rsquo;s sailing from Nantucket, that he had\\r\\n      been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and insensible; by some\\r\\n      unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his ivory limb\\r\\n      having been so violently displaced, that it had stake-wise smitten, and\\r\\n      all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme difficulty that the\\r\\n      agonizing wound was entirely cured.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all the\\r\\n      anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a\\r\\n      former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most poisonous\\r\\n      reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest\\r\\n      songster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity, all miserable\\r\\n      events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than equally, thought\\r\\n      Ahab; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief go further than the\\r\\n      ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of this: that it is an\\r\\n      inference from certain canonic teachings, that while some natural\\r\\n      enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world,\\r\\n      but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of all\\r\\n      hell&rsquo;s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely\\r\\n      beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the\\r\\n      grave; not at all to hint of this, there still seems an inequality in the\\r\\n      deeper analysis of the thing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest\\r\\n      earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in\\r\\n      them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in some\\r\\n      men, an archangelic grandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie\\r\\n      the obvious deduction. To trail the genealogies of these high mortal\\r\\n      miseries, carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the\\r\\n      gods; so that, in the face of all the glad, hay-making suns, and soft\\r\\n      cymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that the\\r\\n      gods themselves are not for ever glad. The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark in\\r\\n      the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more\\r\\n      properly, in set way, have been disclosed before. With many other\\r\\n      particulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to some, why\\r\\n      it was, that for a certain period, both before and after the sailing of\\r\\n      the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such Grand-Lama-like\\r\\n      exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought speechless refuge, as it\\r\\n      were, among the marble senate of the dead. Captain Peleg&rsquo;s bruited reason\\r\\n      for this thing appeared by no means adequate; though, indeed, as touching\\r\\n      all Ahab&rsquo;s deeper part, every revelation partook more of significant\\r\\n      darkness than of explanatory light. But, in the end, it all came out; this\\r\\n      one matter did, at least. That direful mishap was at the bottom of his\\r\\n      temporary recluseness. And not only this, but to that ever-contracting,\\r\\n      dropping circle ashore, who, for any reason, possessed the privilege of a\\r\\n      less banned approach to him; to that timid circle the above hinted\\r\\n      casualty&mdash;remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for by Ahab&mdash;invested\\r\\n      itself with terrors, not entirely underived from the land of spirits and\\r\\n      of wails. So that, through their zeal for him, they had all conspired, so\\r\\n      far as in them lay, to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others;\\r\\n      and hence it was, that not till a considerable interval had elapsed, did\\r\\n      it transpire upon the Pequod&rsquo;s decks.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air, or\\r\\n      the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not with\\r\\n      earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he took plain\\r\\n      practical procedures;&mdash;he called the carpenter.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without delay\\r\\n      set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him supplied\\r\\n      with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which had thus\\r\\n      far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful selection of\\r\\n      the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be secured. This done, the\\r\\n      carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night; and to\\r\\n      provide all the fittings for it, independent of those pertaining to the\\r\\n      distrusted one in use. Moreover, the ship&rsquo;s forge was ordered to be\\r\\n      hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold; and, to accelerate the\\r\\n      affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of\\r\\n      whatever iron contrivances might be needed.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0107\" id=\"link2HCH0107\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 107. The Carpenter.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high\\r\\n      abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But\\r\\n      from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they\\r\\n      seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary.\\r\\n      But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of the\\r\\n      high, humane abstraction; the Pequod&rsquo;s carpenter was no duplicate; hence,\\r\\n      he now comes in person on this stage.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging to\\r\\n      whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent, alike\\r\\n      experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own; the\\r\\n      carpenter&rsquo;s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those\\r\\n      numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an\\r\\n      auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of the generic\\r\\n      remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in\\r\\n      those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a\\r\\n      large ship, upon a three or four years&rsquo; voyage, in uncivilized and\\r\\n      far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties:&mdash;repairing\\r\\n      stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars,\\r\\n      inserting bull&rsquo;s eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks,\\r\\n      and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special\\r\\n      business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of\\r\\n      conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,\\r\\n      was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several\\r\\n      vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times\\r\\n      except when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed\\r\\n      athwartships against the rear of the Try-works.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole: the\\r\\n      carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and straightway files\\r\\n      it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage strays on board, and is\\r\\n      made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of right-whale bone, and\\r\\n      cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking\\r\\n      cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the carpenter concocts a\\r\\n      soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the\\r\\n      blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood, the\\r\\n      carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation. A sailor takes a fancy\\r\\n      to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears. Another has\\r\\n      the toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping one hand upon his\\r\\n      bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow unmanageably winces\\r\\n      under the unconcluded operation; whirling round the handle of his wooden\\r\\n      vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have\\r\\n      him draw the tooth.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent and\\r\\n      without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he deemed\\r\\n      but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But while now\\r\\n      upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness\\r\\n      of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue some uncommon\\r\\n      vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For nothing was this man\\r\\n      more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were;\\r\\n      impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of\\r\\n      things, that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the\\r\\n      whole visible world; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes,\\r\\n      still eternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig\\r\\n      foundations for cathedrals. Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in him,\\r\\n      involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying heartlessness;&mdash;yet\\r\\n      was it oddly dashed at times, with an old, crutch-like, antediluvian,\\r\\n      wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled\\r\\n      wittiness; such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight\\r\\n      watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah&rsquo;s ark. Was it that this old\\r\\n      carpenter had been a life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro,\\r\\n      not only had gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever\\r\\n      small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a\\r\\n      stript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born\\r\\n      babe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next. You\\r\\n      might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a\\r\\n      sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to\\r\\n      work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been\\r\\n      tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or uneven; but\\r\\n      merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal process. He was a\\r\\n      pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one, must have early oozed\\r\\n      along into the muscles of his fingers. He was like one of those\\r\\n      unreasoning but still highly useful, <i>multum in parvo</i>, Sheffield\\r\\n      contrivances, assuming the exterior&mdash;though a little swelled&mdash;of\\r\\n      a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of various sizes,\\r\\n      but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers,\\r\\n      nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted to use the\\r\\n      carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open that part of\\r\\n      him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him up by the legs,\\r\\n      and there they were.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter, was,\\r\\n      after all, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have a common\\r\\n      soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its\\r\\n      duty. What that was, whether essence of quicksilver, or a few drops of\\r\\n      hartshorn, there is no telling. But there it was; and there it had abided\\r\\n      for now some sixty years or more. And this it was, this same\\r\\n      unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him; this it was, that kept him a\\r\\n      great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like an unreasoning wheel,\\r\\n      which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his body was a sentry-box\\r\\n      and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking all the time to keep\\r\\n      himself awake.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0108\" id=\"link2HCH0108\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 108.

That is hard which should be soft, and\\r\\n      that is soft which should be hard. So we go, who file old jaws and\\r\\n      shinbones. Let&rsquo;s try another. Aye, now, this works better (<i>sneezes</i>).\\r\\n      Halloa, this bone dust is (<i>sneezes</i>)&mdash;why it&rsquo;s (<i>sneezes</i>)&mdash;yes\\r\\n      it&rsquo;s (<i>sneezes</i>)&mdash;bless my soul, it won&rsquo;t let me speak!

Lucky now (<i>sneezes</i>)\\r\\n      there&rsquo;s no knee-joint to make; that might puzzle a little; but a mere\\r\\n      shinbone&mdash;why it&rsquo;s easy as making hop-poles; only I should like to\\r\\n      put a good finish on. Time, time; if I but only had the time, I could turn\\r\\n      him out as neat a leg now as ever (<i>sneezes</i>) scraped to a lady in a parlor.\\r\\n      Those buckskin legs and calves of legs I&rsquo;ve seen in shop windows wouldn&rsquo;t\\r\\n      compare at all. They soak water, they do; and of course get rheumatic, and\\r\\n      have to be doctored (<i>sneezes</i>) with washes and lotions, just like live\\r\\n      legs. There; before I saw it off, now, I must call his old Mogulship, and\\r\\n      see whether the length will be all right; too short, if anything, I guess.\\r\\n      Ha! that&rsquo;s the heel; we are in luck; here he comes, or it&rsquo;s somebody else,\\r\\n      that&rsquo;s certain.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      AHAB (<i>advancing</i>). (<i>During the ensuing scene, the carpenter continues\\r\\n      sneezing at times.</i>)\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Well, manmaker!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Just in time, sir. If the captain pleases, I will now mark the length. Let\\r\\n      me measure, sir.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Measured for a leg! good. Well, it&rsquo;s not the first time. About it! There;\\r\\n      keep thy finger on it. This is a cogent vice thou hast here, carpenter;\\r\\n      let me feel its grip once. So, so; it does pinch some.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Oh, sir, it will break bones&mdash;beware, beware!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      No fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this slippery\\r\\n      world that can hold, man. What&rsquo;s Prometheus about there?&mdash;the\\r\\n      blacksmith, I mean&mdash;what&rsquo;s he about?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      He must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Right.

He makes a fierce\\r\\n      red flame there!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Aye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Um-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old\\r\\n      Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a blacksmith,\\r\\n      and animated them with fire; for what&rsquo;s made in fire must properly belong\\r\\n      to fire; and so hell&rsquo;s probable. How the soot flies! This must be the\\r\\n      remainder the Greek made the Africans of. Carpenter, when he&rsquo;s through\\r\\n      with that buckle, tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulder-blades;\\r\\n      there&rsquo;s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Sir?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Hold; while Prometheus is about it, I&rsquo;ll order a complete man after a\\r\\n      desirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest\\r\\n      modelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to &rsquo;em, to stay in\\r\\n      one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no heart at all, brass\\r\\n      forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains; and let me see&mdash;shall\\r\\n      I order eyes to see outwards? No, but put a sky-light on top of his head\\r\\n      to illuminate inwards. There, take the order, and away.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, what&rsquo;s he speaking about, and who&rsquo;s he speaking to, I should like to\\r\\n      know? Shall I keep standing here? (<i>aside</i>).\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &rsquo;Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here&rsquo;s one. No,\\r\\n      no, no; I must have a lantern.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Ho, ho! That&rsquo;s it, hey? Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      What art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man? Thrusted\\r\\n      light is worse than presented pistols.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Carpenter? why that&rsquo;s&mdash;but no;&mdash;a very tidy, and, I may say, an\\r\\n      extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here, carpenter;&mdash;or\\r\\n      would&rsquo;st thou rather work in clay?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Sir?&mdash;Clay? clay, sir? That&rsquo;s mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The fellow&rsquo;s impious! What art thou sneezing about?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Bone is rather dusty, sir.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Take the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself under\\r\\n      living people&rsquo;s noses.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Sir?&mdash;oh! ah!&mdash;I guess so;&mdash;yes&mdash;oh, dear!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Look ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good\\r\\n      workmanlike workman, eh? Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well for thy\\r\\n      work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall nevertheless\\r\\n      feel another leg in the same identical place with it; that is, carpenter,\\r\\n      my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean. Canst thou not drive\\r\\n      that old Adam away?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard\\r\\n      something curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never\\r\\n      entirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still pricking\\r\\n      him at times. May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It is, man. Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was;\\r\\n      so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the soul.\\r\\n      Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there, there to a hair,\\r\\n      do I. Is&rsquo;t a riddle?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      I should humbly call it a poser, sir.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Hist, then. How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing\\r\\n      may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where\\r\\n      thou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy spite? In thy most\\r\\n      solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don&rsquo;t speak!\\r\\n      And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be now so long\\r\\n      dissolved; then, why mayst not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains of\\r\\n      hell for ever, and without a body? Hah!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Good Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over again; I\\r\\n      think I didn&rsquo;t carry a small figure, sir.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Look ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.&mdash;How long before\\r\\n      the leg is done?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Perhaps an hour, sir.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Bungle away at it then, and bring it to me (<i>turns to go</i>). Oh, Life! Here I\\r\\n      am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a\\r\\n      bone to stand on! Cursed be that mortal inter-indebtedness which will not\\r\\n      do away with ledgers. I would be free as air; and I&rsquo;m down in the whole\\r\\n      world&rsquo;s books. I am so rich, I could have given bid for bid with the\\r\\n      wealthiest PrÃ¦torians at the auction of the Roman empire (which was the\\r\\n      world&rsquo;s); and yet I owe for the flesh in the tongue I brag with. By\\r\\n      heavens! I&rsquo;ll get a crucible, and into it, and dissolve myself down to one\\r\\n      small, compendious vertebra. So.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      CARPENTER (<i>resuming his work</i>).\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Well, well, well! Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says he&rsquo;s\\r\\n      queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer; he&rsquo;s queer,\\r\\n      says Stubb; he&rsquo;s queer&mdash;queer, queer; and keeps dinning it into Mr.\\r\\n      Starbuck all the time&mdash;queer&mdash;sir&mdash;queer, queer, very\\r\\n      queer. And here&rsquo;s his leg! Yes, now that I think of it, here&rsquo;s his\\r\\n      bedfellow! has a stick of whale&rsquo;s jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his\\r\\n      leg; he&rsquo;ll stand on this. What was that now about one leg standing in\\r\\n      three places, and all three places standing in one hell&mdash;how was\\r\\n      that? Oh! I don&rsquo;t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I&rsquo;m a sort of\\r\\n      strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that&rsquo;s only haphazard-like.\\r\\n      Then, a short, little old body like me, should never undertake to wade out\\r\\n      into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains; the water chucks you\\r\\n      under the chin pretty quick, and there&rsquo;s a great cry for life-boats. And\\r\\n      here&rsquo;s the heron&rsquo;s leg! long and slim, sure enough! Now, for most folks\\r\\n      one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be because they use them\\r\\n      mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old\\r\\n      coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he&rsquo;s a hard driver. Look, driven one leg to\\r\\n      death, and spavined the other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the\\r\\n      cord. Halloa, there, you Smut! bear a hand there with those screws, and\\r\\n      let&rsquo;s finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with his\\r\\n      horn for all legs, true or false, as brewery-men go round collecting old\\r\\n      beer barrels, to fill &rsquo;em up again. What a leg this is! It looks like a\\r\\n      real live leg, filed down to nothing but the core; he&rsquo;ll be standing on\\r\\n      this to-morrow; he&rsquo;ll be taking altitudes on it. Halloa! I almost forgot\\r\\n      the little oval slate, smoothed ivory, where he figures up the latitude.\\r\\n      So, so; chisel, file, and sand-paper, now!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0109\" id=\"link2HCH0109\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 109.

Hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight;\\r\\n      while by the changed character of the withdrawn water, the mariners\\r\\n      readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and\\r\\n      the Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the\\r\\n      China waters into the Pacific. And so Starbuck found Ahab with a general\\r\\n      chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him; and another\\r\\n      separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the Japanese islands&mdash;Niphon,\\r\\n      Matsmai, and Sikoke. With his snow-white new ivory leg braced against the\\r\\n      screwed leg of his table, and with a long pruning-hook of a jack-knife in\\r\\n      his hand, the wondrous old man, with his back to the gangway door, was\\r\\n      wrinkling his brow, and tracing his old courses again.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning round to\\r\\n      it. &ldquo;On deck! Begone!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is leaking, sir. We\\r\\n      must up Burtons and break out.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Up Burtons and break out? Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to here\\r\\n      for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make good\\r\\n      in a year. What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving,\\r\\n      sir.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;So it is, so it is; if we get it.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all. Begone! Let it leak!\\r\\n      I&rsquo;m all aleak myself. Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky casks,\\r\\n      but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that&rsquo;s a far worse plight\\r\\n      than the Pequod&rsquo;s, man. Yet I don&rsquo;t stop to plug my leak; for who can find\\r\\n      it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to plug it, even if found, in this\\r\\n      life&rsquo;s howling gale? Starbuck! I&rsquo;ll not have the Burtons hoisted.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What will the owners say, sir?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons. What\\r\\n      cares Ahab? Owners, owners? Thou art always prating to me, Starbuck, about\\r\\n      those miserly owners, as if the owners were my conscience. But look ye,\\r\\n      the only real owner of anything is its commander; and hark ye, my\\r\\n      conscience is in this ship&rsquo;s keel.&mdash;On deck!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Captain Ahab,&rdquo; said the reddening mate, moving further into the cabin,\\r\\n      with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed\\r\\n      not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of\\r\\n      itself, but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself; &ldquo;A\\r\\n      better man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quickly\\r\\n      enough resent in a younger man; aye, and in a happier, Captain Ahab.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Devils! Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me?&mdash;On\\r\\n      deck!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat. And I do dare, sir&mdash;to be\\r\\n      forbearing! Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto,\\r\\n      Captain Ahab?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most\\r\\n      South-Sea-men&rsquo;s cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,\\r\\n      exclaimed: &ldquo;There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one Captain\\r\\n      that is lord over the Pequod.&mdash;On deck!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks, you\\r\\n      would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the\\r\\n      levelled tube. But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and as he\\r\\n      quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: &ldquo;Thou hast outraged,\\r\\n      not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck;\\r\\n      thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab; beware of thyself,\\r\\n      old man.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!&rdquo;\\r\\n       murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that he said&mdash;Ahab\\r\\n      beware of Ahab&mdash;there&rsquo;s something there!&rdquo; Then unconsciously using\\r\\n      the musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the\\r\\n      little cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and\\r\\n      returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Thou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck,&rdquo; he said lowly to the mate;\\r\\n      then raising his voice to the crew: &ldquo;Furl the t&rsquo;gallant-sails, and\\r\\n      close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burton, and\\r\\n      break out in the main-hold.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting\\r\\n      Starbuck, Ahab thus acted. It may have been a flash of honesty in him; or\\r\\n      mere prudential policy which, under the circumstance, imperiously forbade\\r\\n      the slightest symptom of open disaffection, however transient, in the\\r\\n      important chief officer of his ship. However it was, his orders were\\r\\n      executed; and the Burtons were hoisted.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0110\" id=\"link2HCH0110\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 110. Queequeg in His Coffin.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were\\r\\n      perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off. So, it being calm\\r\\n      weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the slumbers of the\\r\\n      huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight sending those\\r\\n      gigantic moles into the daylight above. So deep did they go; and so\\r\\n      ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons,\\r\\n      that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone cask containing\\r\\n      coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the posted placards, vainly warning\\r\\n      the infatuated old world from the flood. Tierce after tierce, too, of\\r\\n      water, and bread, and beef, and shooks of staves, and iron bundles of\\r\\n      hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the piled decks were hard to get\\r\\n      about; and the hollow hull echoed under foot, as if you were treading over\\r\\n      empty catacombs, and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air-freighted\\r\\n      demijohn. Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all\\r\\n      Aristotle in his head. Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them\\r\\n      then.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast\\r\\n      bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh to\\r\\n      his endless end.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;\\r\\n      dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the higher\\r\\n      you rise the harder you toil. So with poor Queequeg, who, as harpooneer,\\r\\n      must not only face all the rage of the living whale, but&mdash;as we have\\r\\n      elsewhere seen&mdash;mount his dead back in a rolling sea; and finally\\r\\n      descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating all day in that\\r\\n      subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and\\r\\n      see to their stowage. To be short, among whalemen, the harpooneers are the\\r\\n      holders, so called.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should have\\r\\n      stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where, stripped\\r\\n      to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that\\r\\n      dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well.\\r\\n      And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor pagan; where,\\r\\n      strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible\\r\\n      chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after some days&rsquo; suffering,\\r\\n      laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill of the door of death. How\\r\\n      he wasted and wasted away in those few long-lingering days, till there\\r\\n      seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing. But as all else\\r\\n      in him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless,\\r\\n      seemed growing fuller and fuller; they became of a strange softness of\\r\\n      lustre; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a\\r\\n      wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die, or\\r\\n      be weakened. And like circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter,\\r\\n      expand; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of\\r\\n      Eternity. An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by\\r\\n      the side of this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as\\r\\n      any beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly\\r\\n      wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And\\r\\n      the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all\\r\\n      with a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could\\r\\n      adequately tell. So that&mdash;let us say it again&mdash;no dying Chaldee\\r\\n      or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious\\r\\n      shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay\\r\\n      in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to\\r\\n      his final rest, and the ocean&rsquo;s invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and\\r\\n      higher towards his destined heaven.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself, what\\r\\n      he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked. He\\r\\n      called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was just\\r\\n      breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had chanced\\r\\n      to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich war-wood of his\\r\\n      native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all whalemen who died\\r\\n      in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes, and that the fancy of\\r\\n      being so laid had much pleased him; for it was not unlike the custom of\\r\\n      his own race, who, after embalming a dead warrior, stretched him out in\\r\\n      his canoe, and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelagoes;\\r\\n      for not only do they believe that the stars are isles, but that far beyond\\r\\n      all visible horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with\\r\\n      the blue heavens; and so form the white breakers of the milky way. He\\r\\n      added, that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock,\\r\\n      according to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the\\r\\n      death-devouring sharks. No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket,\\r\\n      all the more congenial to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat\\r\\n      these coffin-canoes were without a keel; though that involved but\\r\\n      uncertain steering, and much lee-way adown the dim ages.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter was\\r\\n      at once commanded to do Queequeg&rsquo;s bidding, whatever it might include.\\r\\n      There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard, which, upon\\r\\n      a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the\\r\\n      Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to\\r\\n      be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order, than taking\\r\\n      his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his\\r\\n      character, proceeded into the forecastle and took Queequeg&rsquo;s measure with\\r\\n      great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg&rsquo;s person as he shifted the\\r\\n      rule.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Ah! poor fellow! he&rsquo;ll have to die now,&rdquo; ejaculated the Long Island\\r\\n      sailor.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general\\r\\n      reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin\\r\\n      was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at\\r\\n      its extremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his tools, and to\\r\\n      work.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he\\r\\n      lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring whether\\r\\n      they were ready for it yet in that direction.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people on\\r\\n      deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one&rsquo;s\\r\\n      consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to\\r\\n      him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some\\r\\n      dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will shortly\\r\\n      trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be indulged.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an\\r\\n      attentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock drawn\\r\\n      from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of\\r\\n      the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also, biscuits were then\\r\\n      ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh water was placed at the\\r\\n      head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot;\\r\\n      and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now\\r\\n      entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he might make trial of its\\r\\n      comforts, if any it had. He lay without moving a few minutes, then told\\r\\n      one to go to his bag and bring out his little god, Yojo. Then crossing his\\r\\n      arms on his breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch\\r\\n      he called it) to be placed over him. The head part turned over with a\\r\\n      leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but his\\r\\n      composed countenance in view. &ldquo;Rarmai&rdquo; (it will do; it is easy), he\\r\\n      murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in his hammock.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all this\\r\\n      while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took him by\\r\\n      the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where go\\r\\n      ye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where the\\r\\n      beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little errand for\\r\\n      me? Seek out one Pip, who&rsquo;s now been missing long: I think he&rsquo;s in those\\r\\n      far Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for he must be very sad;\\r\\n      for look! he&rsquo;s left his tambourine behind;&mdash;I found it. Rig-a-dig,\\r\\n      dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and I&rsquo;ll beat ye your dying march.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, &ldquo;that in\\r\\n      violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues; and\\r\\n      that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their wholly\\r\\n      forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their\\r\\n      hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor Pip, in this\\r\\n      strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers of all our\\r\\n      heavenly homes. Where learned he that, but there?&mdash;Hark! he speaks\\r\\n      again: but more wildly now.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Form two and two! Let&rsquo;s make a General of him! Ho, where&rsquo;s his harpoon?\\r\\n      Lay it across here.&mdash;Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a game cock\\r\\n      now to sit upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies game!&mdash;mind ye that;\\r\\n      Queequeg dies game!&mdash;take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies game! I\\r\\n      say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward; died all\\r\\n      a&rsquo;shiver;&mdash;out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the\\r\\n      Antilles he&rsquo;s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell them he jumped\\r\\n      from a whale-boat! I&rsquo;d never beat my tambourine over base Pip, and hail\\r\\n      him General, if he were once more dying here. No, no! shame upon all\\r\\n      cowards&mdash;shame upon them! Let &rsquo;em go drown like Pip, that jumped from\\r\\n      a whale-boat. Shame! shame!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip was\\r\\n      led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now that\\r\\n      his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon there\\r\\n      seemed no need of the carpenter&rsquo;s box: and thereupon, when some expressed\\r\\n      their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the cause of his\\r\\n      sudden convalescence was this;&mdash;at a critical moment, he had just\\r\\n      recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone; and therefore\\r\\n      had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet, he averred. They\\r\\n      asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign\\r\\n      will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a word, it was Queequeg&rsquo;s\\r\\n      conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not\\r\\n      kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable,\\r\\n      unintelligent destroyer of that sort.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized;\\r\\n      that while a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing, generally\\r\\n      speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day. So, in good\\r\\n      time my Queequeg gained strength; and at length after sitting on the\\r\\n      windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a vigorous appetite) he\\r\\n      suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms and legs, gave himself a\\r\\n      good stretching, yawned a little bit, and then springing into the head of\\r\\n      his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself fit for a\\r\\n      fight.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and\\r\\n      emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there. Many\\r\\n      spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque\\r\\n      figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was striving, in his\\r\\n      rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body. And this\\r\\n      tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island,\\r\\n      who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written out on his body a complete\\r\\n      theory of the heavens and the earth, and a mystical treatise on the art of\\r\\n      attaining truth; so that Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to\\r\\n      unfold; a wondrous work in one volume; but whose mysteries not even\\r\\n      himself could read, though his own live heart beat against them; and these\\r\\n      mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the\\r\\n      living parchment whereon they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the\\r\\n      last. And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild\\r\\n      exclamation of his, when one morning turning away from surveying poor\\r\\n      Queequeg&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, devilish tantalization of the gods!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0111\" id=\"link2HCH0111\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 111.

And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery\\r\\n      prairies and Potters&rsquo; Fields of all four continents, the waves should rise\\r\\n      and fall, and ebb and flow unceasingly; for here, millions of mixed shades\\r\\n      and shadows, drowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all that we call\\r\\n      lives and souls, lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like slumberers in\\r\\n      their beds; the ever-rolling waves but made so by their restlessness.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must\\r\\n      ever after be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost waters of the\\r\\n      world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same waves\\r\\n      wash the moles of the new-built Californian towns, but yesterday planted\\r\\n      by the recentest race of men, and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts\\r\\n      of Asiatic lands, older than Abraham; while all between float milky-ways\\r\\n      of coral isles, and low-lying, endless, unknown Archipelagoes, and\\r\\n      impenetrable Japans. Thus this mysterious, divine Pacific zones the\\r\\n      world&rsquo;s whole bulk about; makes all coasts one bay to it; seems the\\r\\n      tide-beating heart of earth. Lifted by those eternal swells, you needs\\r\\n      must own the seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab&rsquo;s brain, as standing like an iron\\r\\n      statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with one nostril\\r\\n      he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles (in whose\\r\\n      sweet woods mild lovers must be walking), and with the other consciously\\r\\n      inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea; that sea in which the hated\\r\\n      White Whale must even then be swimming. Launched at length upon these\\r\\n      almost final waters, and gliding towards the Japanese cruising-ground, the\\r\\n      old man&rsquo;s purpose intensified itself. His firm lips met like the lips of a\\r\\n      vice; the Delta of his forehead&rsquo;s veins swelled like overladen brooks; in\\r\\n      his very sleep, his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull, &ldquo;Stern all!\\r\\n      the White Whale spouts thick blood!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0112\" id=\"link2HCH0112\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 112. The Blacksmith.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in\\r\\n      these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits\\r\\n      shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old blacksmith,\\r\\n      had not removed his portable forge to the hold again, after concluding his\\r\\n      contributory work for Ahab&rsquo;s leg, but still retained it on deck, fast\\r\\n      lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being now almost incessantly invoked\\r\\n      by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and bowsmen to do some little job for\\r\\n      them; altering, or repairing, or new shaping their various weapons and\\r\\n      boat furniture. Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle, all\\r\\n      waiting to be served; holding boat-spades, pike-heads, harpoons, and\\r\\n      lances, and jealously watching his every sooty movement, as he toiled.\\r\\n      Nevertheless, this old man&rsquo;s was a patient hammer wielded by a patient\\r\\n      arm. No murmur, no impatience, no petulance did come from him. Silent,\\r\\n      slow, and solemn; bowing over still further his chronically broken back,\\r\\n      he toiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the heavy beating of his\\r\\n      hammer the heavy beating of his heart. And so it was.&mdash;Most\\r\\n      miserable!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing\\r\\n      yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited the\\r\\n      curiosity of the mariners. And to the importunity of their persisted\\r\\n      questionings he had finally given in; and so it came to pass that every\\r\\n      one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Belated, and not innocently, one bitter winter&rsquo;s midnight, on the road\\r\\n      running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt the\\r\\n      deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning,\\r\\n      dilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss of the extremities of both feet.\\r\\n      Out of this revelation, part by part, at last came out the four acts of\\r\\n      the gladness, and the one long, and as yet uncatastrophied fifth act of\\r\\n      the grief of his life&rsquo;s drama.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly\\r\\n      encountered that thing in sorrow&rsquo;s technicals called ruin. He had been an\\r\\n      artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house and\\r\\n      garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three blithe,\\r\\n      ruddy children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church, planted in\\r\\n      a grove. But one night, under cover of darkness, and further concealed in\\r\\n      a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into his happy home,\\r\\n      and robbed them all of everything. And darker yet to tell, the blacksmith\\r\\n      himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family&rsquo;s heart. It\\r\\n      was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of that fatal cork, forth flew\\r\\n      the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now, for prudent, most wise, and\\r\\n      economic reasons, the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop was in the basement of his\\r\\n      dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so that always had the young\\r\\n      and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness, but with\\r\\n      vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband&rsquo;s\\r\\n      hammer; whose reverberations, muffled by passing through the floors and\\r\\n      walls, came up to her, not unsweetly, in her nursery; and so, to stout\\r\\n      Labor&rsquo;s iron lullaby, the blacksmith&rsquo;s infants were rocked to slumber.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely? Hadst\\r\\n      thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him,\\r\\n      then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her orphans a truly\\r\\n      venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after years; and all of\\r\\n      them a care-killing competency. But Death plucked down some virtuous elder\\r\\n      brother, on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of\\r\\n      some other family, and left the worse than useless old man standing, till\\r\\n      the hideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Why tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew more\\r\\n      and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the last; the\\r\\n      wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes, glitteringly gazing\\r\\n      into the weeping faces of her children; the bellows fell; the forge choked\\r\\n      up with cinders; the house was sold; the mother dived down into the long\\r\\n      church-yard grass; her children twice followed her thither; and the\\r\\n      houseless, familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in crape; his every\\r\\n      woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to flaxen curls!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death is\\r\\n      only a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it is but the\\r\\n      first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote, the Wild, the\\r\\n      Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the death-longing eyes of such men,\\r\\n      who still have left in them some interior compunctions against suicide,\\r\\n      does the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean alluringly spread forth\\r\\n      his whole plain of unimaginable, taking terrors, and wonderful, new-life\\r\\n      adventures; and from the hearts of infinite Pacifics, the thousand\\r\\n      mermaids sing to them&mdash;&ldquo;Come hither, broken-hearted; here is another\\r\\n      life without the guilt of intermediate death; here are wonders\\r\\n      supernatural, without dying for them. Come hither! bury thyself in a life\\r\\n      which, to your now equally abhorred and abhorring, landed world, is more\\r\\n      oblivious than death. Come hither! put up <i>thy</i> gravestone, too, within the\\r\\n      churchyard, and come hither, till we marry thee!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Hearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by fall\\r\\n      of eve, the blacksmith&rsquo;s soul responded, Aye, I come! And so Perth went\\r\\n      a-whaling.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0113\" id=\"link2HCH0113\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 113. The Forge.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about\\r\\n      mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter placed\\r\\n      upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the coals, and\\r\\n      with the other at his forge&rsquo;s lungs, when Captain Ahab came along,\\r\\n      carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. While yet a\\r\\n      little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till at last, Perth,\\r\\n      withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon the anvil&mdash;the\\r\\n      red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights, some of which\\r\\n      flew close to Ahab.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Are these thy Mother Carey&rsquo;s chickens, Perth? they are always flying in\\r\\n      thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;&mdash;look here, they\\r\\n      burn; but thou&mdash;thou liv&rsquo;st among them without a scorch.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab,&rdquo; answered Perth, resting\\r\\n      for a moment on his hammer; &ldquo;I am past scorching; not easily can&rsquo;st thou\\r\\n      scorch a scar.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Well, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful to\\r\\n      me. In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in others that is\\r\\n      not mad. Thou should&rsquo;st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost thou not go mad?\\r\\n      How can&rsquo;st thou endure without being mad? Do the heavens yet hate thee,\\r\\n      that thou can&rsquo;st not go mad?&mdash;What wert thou making there?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And can&rsquo;st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such hard\\r\\n      usage as it had?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I think so, sir.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And I suppose thou can&rsquo;st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never mind\\r\\n      how hard the metal, blacksmith?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Look ye here, then,&rdquo; cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning with\\r\\n      both hands on Perth&rsquo;s shoulders; &ldquo;look ye here&mdash;<i>here</i>&mdash;can ye\\r\\n      smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith,&rdquo; sweeping one hand across his\\r\\n      ribbed brow; &ldquo;if thou could&rsquo;st, blacksmith, glad enough would I lay my\\r\\n      head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes. Answer!\\r\\n      Can&rsquo;st thou smoothe this seam?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for though\\r\\n      thou only see&rsquo;st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into the bone of\\r\\n      my skull&mdash;<i>that</i> is all wrinkles! But, away with child&rsquo;s play; no more\\r\\n      gaffs and pikes to-day. Look ye here!&rdquo; jingling the leathern bag, as if it\\r\\n      were full of gold coins. &ldquo;I, too, want a harpoon made; one that a thousand\\r\\n      yoke of fiends could not part, Perth; something that will stick in a whale\\r\\n      like his own fin-bone. There&rsquo;s the stuff,&rdquo; flinging the pouch upon the\\r\\n      anvil. &ldquo;Look ye, blacksmith, these are the gathered nail-stubbs of the\\r\\n      steel shoes of racing horses.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the best\\r\\n      and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the\\r\\n      melted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me\\r\\n      first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer these\\r\\n      twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick! I&rsquo;ll blow\\r\\n      the fire.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by\\r\\n      spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. &ldquo;A\\r\\n      flaw!&rdquo; rejecting the last one. &ldquo;Work that over again, Perth.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when Ahab\\r\\n      stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then, with\\r\\n      regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to him the\\r\\n      glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge shooting up\\r\\n      its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and bowing over\\r\\n      his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on\\r\\n      the toil. But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?&rdquo; muttered Stubb,\\r\\n      looking on from the forecastle. &ldquo;That Parsee smells fire like a fusee; and\\r\\n      smells of it himself, like a hot musket&rsquo;s powder-pan.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as\\r\\n      Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near\\r\\n      by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab&rsquo;s bent face.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Would&rsquo;st thou brand me, Perth?&rdquo; wincing for a moment with the pain; &ldquo;have\\r\\n      I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this\\r\\n      harpoon for the White Whale?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;For the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must make them thyself,\\r\\n      man. Here are my razors&mdash;the best of steel; here, and make the barbs\\r\\n      sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain\\r\\n      not use them.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave, sup,\\r\\n      nor pray till&mdash;but here&mdash;to work!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the shank,\\r\\n      the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the blacksmith was\\r\\n      about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to tempering them, he cried\\r\\n      to Ahab to place the water-cask near.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy,\\r\\n      there! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me as\\r\\n      much blood as will cover this barb?&rdquo; holding it high up. A cluster of dark\\r\\n      nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh, and the\\r\\n      White Whale&rsquo;s barbs were then tempered.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!&rdquo; deliriously\\r\\n      howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal\\r\\n      blood.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of hickory,\\r\\n      with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the socket of the\\r\\n      iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some fathoms of it\\r\\n      taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension. Pressing his foot\\r\\n      upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string, then eagerly bending\\r\\n      over it, and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed, &ldquo;Good! and now for the\\r\\n      seizings.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns\\r\\n      were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole was\\r\\n      then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope was\\r\\n      traced half-way along the pole&rsquo;s length, and firmly secured so, with\\r\\n      intertwistings of twine. This done, pole, iron, and rope&mdash;like the\\r\\n      Three Fates&mdash;remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with\\r\\n      the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory pole,\\r\\n      both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he entered his cabin,\\r\\n      light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was heard. Oh,\\r\\n      Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy strange\\r\\n      mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy\\r\\n      ship, and mocked it!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0114\" id=\"link2HCH0114\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 114.

Often, in mild,\\r\\n      pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on the\\r\\n      stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily pulling, or sailing, or\\r\\n      paddling after the whales, or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes\\r\\n      calmly awaiting their uprising; though with but small success for their\\r\\n      pains.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow\\r\\n      heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so\\r\\n      sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone\\r\\n      cats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times of dreamy\\r\\n      quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the ocean&rsquo;s\\r\\n      skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and would not\\r\\n      willingly remember, that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      These are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a\\r\\n      certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he\\r\\n      regards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing only\\r\\n      the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through high rolling\\r\\n      waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie: as when the\\r\\n      western emigrants&rsquo; horses only show their erected ears, while their hidden\\r\\n      bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these there\\r\\n      steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied children lie\\r\\n      sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when the flowers of\\r\\n      the woods are plucked. And all this mixes with your most mystic mood; so\\r\\n      that fact and fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate, and form one\\r\\n      seamless whole.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as\\r\\n      temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem to\\r\\n      open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath upon them\\r\\n      prove but tarnishing.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in ye,&mdash;though\\r\\n      long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life,&mdash;in ye, men yet\\r\\n      may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; and for some few\\r\\n      fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them. Would to\\r\\n      God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled, mingling threads of\\r\\n      life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a storm for\\r\\n      every calm. There is no steady unretracing progress in this life; we do\\r\\n      not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one pause:&mdash;through\\r\\n      infancy&rsquo;s unconscious spell, boyhood&rsquo;s thoughtless faith, adolescence&rsquo;\\r\\n      doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last\\r\\n      in manhood&rsquo;s pondering repose of If. But once gone through, we trace the\\r\\n      round again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies\\r\\n      the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more? In what rapt ether sails the\\r\\n      world, of which the weariest will never weary? Where is the foundling&rsquo;s\\r\\n      father hidden? Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die\\r\\n      in bearing them: the secret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we\\r\\n      must there to learn it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat&rsquo;s side into that\\r\\n      same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:&mdash;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride&rsquo;s eye!&mdash;Tell\\r\\n      me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping cannibal ways.

The Pequod Meets The Bachelor.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down\\r\\n      before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab&rsquo;s harpoon had been welded.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her last\\r\\n      cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in glad\\r\\n      holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously, sailing\\r\\n      round among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous to pointing\\r\\n      her prow for home.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting\\r\\n      at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended, bottom down;\\r\\n      and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the\\r\\n      last whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colours were\\r\\n      flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways lashed in each of her\\r\\n      three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm; above which, in her\\r\\n      top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid;\\r\\n      and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most surprising\\r\\n      success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the same seas\\r\\n      numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single\\r\\n      fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room\\r\\n      for the far more valuable sperm, but additional supplemental casks had\\r\\n      been bartered for, from the ships she had met; and these were stowed along\\r\\n      the deck, and in the captain&rsquo;s and officers&rsquo; state-rooms. Even the cabin\\r\\n      table itself had been knocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined\\r\\n      off the broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a\\r\\n      centrepiece. In the forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and\\r\\n      pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously added, that the\\r\\n      cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the\\r\\n      steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the\\r\\n      harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them; that\\r\\n      indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the captain&rsquo;s pantaloons\\r\\n      pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his hands into, in\\r\\n      self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the\\r\\n      barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing\\r\\n      still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge\\r\\n      try-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like <i>poke</i> or stomach skin of\\r\\n      the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched\\r\\n      hands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and harpooneers were\\r\\n      dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with them from the\\r\\n      Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat, firmly secured\\r\\n      aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long Island negroes, with\\r\\n      glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were presiding over the hilarious\\r\\n      jig. Meanwhile, others of the ship&rsquo;s company were tumultuously busy at the\\r\\n      masonry of the try-works, from which the huge pots had been removed. You\\r\\n      would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such\\r\\n      wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were being\\r\\n      hurled into the sea.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the ship&rsquo;s\\r\\n      elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was full before\\r\\n      him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black, with\\r\\n      a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other&rsquo;s wakes&mdash;one\\r\\n      all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings as to things\\r\\n      to come&mdash;their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole\\r\\n      striking contrast of the scene.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Come aboard, come aboard!&rdquo; cried the gay Bachelor&rsquo;s commander, lifting a\\r\\n      glass and a bottle in the air.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Hast seen the White Whale?&rdquo; gritted Ahab in reply.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;No; only heard of him; but don&rsquo;t believe in him at all,&rdquo; said the other\\r\\n      good-humoredly. &ldquo;Come aboard!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Thou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Not enough to speak of&mdash;two islanders, that&rsquo;s all;&mdash;but come\\r\\n      aboard, old hearty, come along. I&rsquo;ll soon take that black from your brow.\\r\\n      Come along, will ye (merry&rsquo;s the play); a full ship and homeward-bound.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;How wondrous familiar is a fool!&rdquo; muttered Ahab; then aloud, &ldquo;Thou art a\\r\\n      full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me an empty\\r\\n      ship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward there!\\r\\n      Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other\\r\\n      stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew of\\r\\n      the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the receding\\r\\n      Bachelor; but the Bachelor&rsquo;s men never heeding their gaze for the lively\\r\\n      revelry they were in. And as Ahab, leaning over the taffrail, eyed the\\r\\n      homeward-bound craft, he took from his pocket a small vial of sand, and\\r\\n      then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed thereby bringing two remote\\r\\n      associations together, for that vial was filled with Nantucket soundings.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0116\" id=\"link2HCH0116\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 116.

So seemed it\\r\\n      with the Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor, whales\\r\\n      were seen and four were slain; and one of them by Ahab.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the crimson\\r\\n      fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky, sun and\\r\\n      whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and such\\r\\n      plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air, that\\r\\n      it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of the\\r\\n      Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned sailor, had gone\\r\\n      to sea, freighted with these vesper hymns.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned off\\r\\n      from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from the now\\r\\n      tranquil boat. For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales\\r\\n      dying&mdash;the turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring&mdash;that\\r\\n      strange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab\\r\\n      conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He turns and turns him to it,&mdash;how slowly, but how steadfastly, his\\r\\n      homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions.

The Quadrant.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,\\r\\n      coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would\\r\\n      ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to\\r\\n      the braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on\\r\\n      the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship&rsquo;s prow for\\r\\n      the equator. In good time the order came. It was hard upon high noon; and\\r\\n      Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was about taking his\\r\\n      wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of\\r\\n      effulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing focus\\r\\n      of the glassy ocean&rsquo;s immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks lacquered;\\r\\n      clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this nakedness of\\r\\n      unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of God&rsquo;s throne. Well\\r\\n      that Ahab&rsquo;s quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses, through which to\\r\\n      take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging his seated form to the roll of\\r\\n      the ship, and with his astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye,\\r\\n      he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant\\r\\n      when the sun should gain its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole\\r\\n      attention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship&rsquo;s\\r\\n      deck, and with face thrown up like Ahab&rsquo;s, was eyeing the same sun with\\r\\n      him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face\\r\\n      was subdued to an earthly passionlessness. At length the desired\\r\\n      observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab soon\\r\\n      calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant. Then falling\\r\\n      into a moment&rsquo;s revery, he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to\\r\\n      himself: &ldquo;Thou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly\\r\\n      where I <i>am</i>&mdash;but canst thou cast the least hint where I <i>shall</i> be? Or\\r\\n      canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living?\\r\\n      Where is Moby Dick? This instant thou must be eyeing him. These eyes of\\r\\n      mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him; aye, and into\\r\\n      the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown,\\r\\n      thither side of thee, thou sun!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its\\r\\n      numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:\\r\\n      &ldquo;Foolish toy! babies&rsquo; plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores, and\\r\\n      Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but what\\r\\n      after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where thou\\r\\n      thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that holds thee:\\r\\n      no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one drop of water or one\\r\\n      grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy impotence thou\\r\\n      insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy; and cursed be all\\r\\n      the things that cast man&rsquo;s eyes aloft to that heaven, whose live vividness\\r\\n      but scorches him, as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light,\\r\\n      O sun!

Unobserved he rose and glided away; while,\\r\\n      awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered together\\r\\n      on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck, shouted out&mdash;&ldquo;To\\r\\n      the braces! Up helm!&mdash;square in!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled upon her\\r\\n      heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her long,\\r\\n      ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one sufficient\\r\\n      steed.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod&rsquo;s\\r\\n      tumultuous way, and Ahab&rsquo;s also, as he went lurching along the deck.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full of\\r\\n      its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down, down,\\r\\n      to dumbest dust.

The Candles.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal crouches\\r\\n      in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most effulgent but basket\\r\\n      the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoes that never swept\\r\\n      tame northern lands. So, too, it is, that in these resplendent Japanese\\r\\n      seas the mariner encounters the direst of all storms, the Typhoon. It will\\r\\n      sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a\\r\\n      dazed and sleepy town.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and\\r\\n      bare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly\\r\\n      ahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the\\r\\n      thunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled masts\\r\\n      fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the\\r\\n      tempest had left for its after sport.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at every\\r\\n      flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional disaster\\r\\n      might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb and Flask were\\r\\n      directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats.\\r\\n      But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted to the very top of the\\r\\n      cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab&rsquo;s) did not escape. A great rolling\\r\\n      sea, dashing high up against the reeling ship&rsquo;s high teetering side, stove\\r\\n      in the boat&rsquo;s bottom at the stern, and left it again, all dripping through\\r\\n      like a sieve.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck,&rdquo; said Stubb, regarding the wreck, &ldquo;but\\r\\n      the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can&rsquo;t fight it. You see, Mr.\\r\\n      Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps, all round\\r\\n      the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me, all the start\\r\\n      I have to meet it, is just across the deck here.

Yonder, to windward, all is blackness of doom;\\r\\n      but to leeward, homeward&mdash;I see it lightens up there; but not with\\r\\n      the lightning.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following the\\r\\n      flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same instant a\\r\\n      volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Old Thunder!&rdquo; said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his\\r\\n      pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed\\r\\n      lances of fire.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the\\r\\n      perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some ships\\r\\n      carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But as this\\r\\n      conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may avoid all\\r\\n      contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly towing there,\\r\\n      it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering not a little with\\r\\n      some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the vessel&rsquo;s way in the\\r\\n      water; because of all this, the lower parts of a ship&rsquo;s lightning-rods are\\r\\n      not always overboard; but are generally made in long slender links, so as\\r\\n      to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside, or thrown down\\r\\n      into the sea, as occasion may require.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The rods! the rods!&rdquo; cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished to\\r\\n      vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux, to\\r\\n      light Ahab to his post. &ldquo;Are they overboard? drop them over, fore and aft.\\r\\n      Quick!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Avast!&rdquo; cried Ahab; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have fair play here, though we be the weaker\\r\\n      side. Yet I&rsquo;ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and Andes, that\\r\\n      all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let them be, sir.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Look aloft!&rdquo; cried Starbuck. &ldquo;The corpusants! the corpusants!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each\\r\\n      tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of\\r\\n      the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like\\r\\n      three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Blast the boat! let it go!&rdquo; cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing\\r\\n      sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently\\r\\n      jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. &ldquo;Blast it!&rdquo;&mdash;but\\r\\n      slipping backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; and\\r\\n      immediately shifting his tone he cried&mdash;&ldquo;The corpusants have mercy on\\r\\n      us all!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of\\r\\n      the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses from\\r\\n      the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething sea; but\\r\\n      in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when God&rsquo;s burning\\r\\n      finger has been laid on the ship; when His &ldquo;Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin&rdquo;\\r\\n       has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the\\r\\n      enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle, all\\r\\n      their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away\\r\\n      constellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the gigantic\\r\\n      jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and seemed the\\r\\n      black cloud from which the thunder had come. The parted mouth of Tashtego\\r\\n      revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely gleamed as if they too had\\r\\n      been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by the preternatural light,\\r\\n      Queequeg&rsquo;s tattooing burned like Satanic blue flames on his body.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more the\\r\\n      Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment or two\\r\\n      passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one. It was\\r\\n      Stubb. &ldquo;What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not the same\\r\\n      in the song.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;No, no, it wasn&rsquo;t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I hope\\r\\n      they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?&mdash;have\\r\\n      they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck&mdash;but it&rsquo;s too\\r\\n      dark to look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign\\r\\n      of good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be\\r\\n      chock a&rsquo; block with sperm-oil, d&rsquo;ye see; and so, all that sperm will work\\r\\n      up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will yet be as\\r\\n      three spermaceti candles&mdash;that&rsquo;s the good promise we saw.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb&rsquo;s face slowly beginning to\\r\\n      glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: &ldquo;See! see!&rdquo; and once more\\r\\n      the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled\\r\\n      supernaturalness in their pallor.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The corpusants have mercy on us all,&rdquo; cried Stubb, again.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame, the\\r\\n      Parsee was kneeling in Ahab&rsquo;s front, but with his head bowed away from\\r\\n      him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where they\\r\\n      had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen, arrested by\\r\\n      the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a knot of numbed\\r\\n      wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various enchanted attitudes, like\\r\\n      the standing, or stepping, or running skeletons in Herculaneum, others\\r\\n      remained rooted to the deck; but all their eyes upcast.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, aye, men!&rdquo; cried Ahab. &ldquo;Look up at it; mark it well; the white flame\\r\\n      but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those mainmast links there;\\r\\n      I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against it; blood against\\r\\n      fire! So.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Then turning&mdash;the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his\\r\\n      foot upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm,\\r\\n      he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian once\\r\\n      did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that to this\\r\\n      hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I now know\\r\\n      that thy right worship is defiance. To neither love nor reverence wilt\\r\\n      thou be kind; and e&rsquo;en for hate thou canst but kill; and all are killed.\\r\\n      No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless, placeless power;\\r\\n      but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional,\\r\\n      unintegral mastery in me. In the midst of the personified impersonal, a\\r\\n      personality stands here. Though but a point at best; whencesoe&rsquo;er I came;\\r\\n      wheresoe&rsquo;er I go; yet while I earthly live, the queenly personality lives\\r\\n      in me, and feels her royal rights. But war is pain, and hate is woe. Come\\r\\n      in thy lowest form of love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy\\r\\n      highest, come as mere supernal power; and though thou launchest navies of\\r\\n      full-freighted worlds, there&rsquo;s that in here that still remains\\r\\n      indifferent. Oh, thou clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a\\r\\n      true child of fire, I breathe it back to thee.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      [<i>Sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; the nine flames leap lengthwise to\\r\\n      thrice their previous height; Ahab, with the rest, closes his eyes, his\\r\\n      right hand pressed hard upon them.</i>]\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so? Nor was it wrung\\r\\n      from me; nor do I now drop these links. Thou canst blind; but I can then\\r\\n      grope. Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the homage of\\r\\n      these poor eyes, and shutter-hands. I would not take it. The lightning\\r\\n      flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my whole beaten\\r\\n      brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning ground. Oh, oh! Yet\\r\\n      blindfold, yet will I talk to thee. Light though thou be, thou leapest out\\r\\n      of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of light, leaping out of thee!\\r\\n      The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not? There burn the flames! Oh,\\r\\n      thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my genealogy. But thou art but my\\r\\n      fiery father; my sweet mother, I know not. Oh, cruel! what hast thou done\\r\\n      with her? There lies my puzzle; but thine is greater. Thou knowest not how\\r\\n      came ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy\\r\\n      beginning, hence callest thyself unbegun. I know that of me, which thou\\r\\n      knowest not of thyself, oh, thou omnipotent. There is some unsuffusing\\r\\n      thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit, to whom all thy eternity is but\\r\\n      time, all thy creativeness mechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my\\r\\n      scorched eyes do dimly see it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit\\r\\n      immemorial, thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated\\r\\n      grief. Here again with haughty agony, I read my sire. Leap! leap up, and\\r\\n      lick the sky! I leap with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded\\r\\n      with thee; defyingly I worship thee!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The boat! the boat!&rdquo; cried Starbuck, &ldquo;look at thy boat, old man!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Ahab&rsquo;s harpoon, the one forged at Perth&rsquo;s fire, remained firmly lashed in\\r\\n      its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale-boat&rsquo;s bow;\\r\\n      but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath\\r\\n      to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame\\r\\n      of pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent&rsquo;s\\r\\n      tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm&mdash;&ldquo;God, God is against thee,\\r\\n      old man; forbear! &rsquo;tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me\\r\\n      square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a fair wind of it\\r\\n      homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the braces&mdash;though\\r\\n      not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast mate&rsquo;s thoughts\\r\\n      seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But dashing the rattling\\r\\n      lightning links to the deck, and snatching the burning harpoon, Ahab waved\\r\\n      it like a torch among them; swearing to transfix with it the first sailor\\r\\n      that but cast loose a rope&rsquo;s end. Petrified by his aspect, and still more\\r\\n      shrinking from the fiery dart that he held, the men fell back in dismay,\\r\\n      and Ahab again spoke:&mdash;\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and heart,\\r\\n      soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye may know to\\r\\n      what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out the last fear!&rdquo;\\r\\n       And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of\\r\\n      some lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it so\\r\\n      much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts; so\\r\\n      at those last words of Ahab&rsquo;s many of the mariners did run from him in a\\r\\n      terror of dismay.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0120\" id=\"link2HCH0120\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 120.

And how long ago\\r\\n      is it since you said the very contrary? Didn&rsquo;t you once say that whatever\\r\\n      ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something extra on its insurance\\r\\n      policy, just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of\\r\\n      lucifers forward? Stop, now; didn&rsquo;t you say so?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Well, suppose I did? What then? I&rsquo;ve part changed my flesh since that\\r\\n      time, why not my mind? Besides, supposing we <i>are</i> loaded with powder\\r\\n      barrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get\\r\\n      afire in this drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you have pretty\\r\\n      red hair, but you couldn&rsquo;t get afire now. Shake yourself; you&rsquo;re Aquarius,\\r\\n      or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat collar. Don&rsquo;t\\r\\n      you see, then, that for these extra risks the Marine Insurance companies\\r\\n      have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask. But hark, again, and I&rsquo;ll\\r\\n      answer ye the other thing. First take your leg off from the crown of the\\r\\n      anchor here, though, so I can pass the rope; now listen. What&rsquo;s the mighty\\r\\n      difference between holding a mast&rsquo;s lightning-rod in the storm, and\\r\\n      standing close by a mast that hasn&rsquo;t got any lightning-rod at all in a\\r\\n      storm? Don&rsquo;t you see, you timber-head, that no harm can come to the holder\\r\\n      of the rod, unless the mast is first struck? What are you talking about,\\r\\n      then? Not one ship in a hundred carries rods, and Ahab,&mdash;aye, man,\\r\\n      and all of us,&mdash;were in no more danger then, in my poor opinion, than\\r\\n      all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas. Why, you\\r\\n      King-Post, you, I suppose you would have every man in the world go about\\r\\n      with a small lightning-rod running up the corner of his hat, like a\\r\\n      militia officer&rsquo;s skewered feather, and trailing behind like his sash. Why\\r\\n      don&rsquo;t ye be sensible, Flask? it&rsquo;s easy to be sensible; why don&rsquo;t ye, then?\\r\\n      any man with half an eye can be sensible.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Yes, when a fellow&rsquo;s soaked through, it&rsquo;s hard to be sensible, that&rsquo;s a\\r\\n      fact. And I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind; catch the turn\\r\\n      there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as\\r\\n      if they were never going to be used again. Tying these two anchors here,\\r\\n      Flask, seems like tying a man&rsquo;s hands behind him. And what big generous\\r\\n      hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron fists, hey? What a hold\\r\\n      they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the world is anchored anywhere;\\r\\n      if she is, she swings with an uncommon long cable, though. There, hammer\\r\\n      that knot down, and we&rsquo;ve done. So; next to touching land, lighting on\\r\\n      deck is the most satisfactory. I say, just wring out my jacket skirts,\\r\\n      will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at long-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a\\r\\n      long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat. The tails\\r\\n      tapering down that way, serve to carry off the water, d&rsquo;ye see. Same with\\r\\n      cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more\\r\\n      monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me; I must mount a swallow-tail, and\\r\\n      drive down a beaver; so. Halloa! whew! there goes my tarpaulin overboard;\\r\\n      Lord, Lord, that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly!\\r\\n      This is a nasty night, lad.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0122\" id=\"link2HCH0122\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 122.

The Musket.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the Pequod&rsquo;s\\r\\n      jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its\\r\\n      spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had been attached to it&mdash;for\\r\\n      they were slack&mdash;because some play to the tiller was indispensable.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to\\r\\n      the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses,\\r\\n      at intervals, go round and round. It was thus with the Pequod&rsquo;s; at almost\\r\\n      every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity\\r\\n      with which they revolved upon the cards; it is a sight that hardly anyone\\r\\n      can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the\\r\\n      strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb&mdash;one engaged forward and\\r\\n      the other aft&mdash;the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and\\r\\n      main-top-sails were cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away to\\r\\n      leeward, like the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast to\\r\\n      the winds when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a\\r\\n      storm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through the\\r\\n      water with some precision again; and the course&mdash;for the present,\\r\\n      East-south-east&mdash;which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more\\r\\n      given to the helmsman. For during the violence of the gale, he had only\\r\\n      steered according to its vicissitudes. But as he was now bringing the ship\\r\\n      as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile, lo! a good\\r\\n      sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye, the foul breeze became\\r\\n      fair!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of &ldquo;<i>Ho! the fair\\r\\n      wind! oh-ye-ho, cheerly men!</i>&rdquo; the crew singing for joy, that so promising\\r\\n      an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In compliance with the standing order of his commander&mdash;to report\\r\\n      immediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided change\\r\\n      in the affairs of the deck,&mdash;Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards\\r\\n      to the breeze&mdash;however reluctantly and gloomily,&mdash;than he\\r\\n      mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a\\r\\n      moment. The cabin lamp&mdash;taking long swings this way and that&mdash;was\\r\\n      burning fitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old man&rsquo;s bolted\\r\\n      door,&mdash;a thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of upper\\r\\n      panels. The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming\\r\\n      silence to reign there, though it was hooped round by all the roar of the\\r\\n      elements. The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed, as they\\r\\n      stood upright against the forward bulkhead. Starbuck was an honest,\\r\\n      upright man; but out of Starbuck&rsquo;s heart, at that instant when he saw the\\r\\n      muskets, there strangely evolved an evil thought; but so blent with its\\r\\n      neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for\\r\\n      itself.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He would have shot me once,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;yes, there&rsquo;s the very musket\\r\\n      that he pointed at me;&mdash;that one with the studded stock; let me touch\\r\\n      it&mdash;lift it. Strange, that I, who have handled so many deadly lances,\\r\\n      strange, that I should shake so now. Loaded? I must see. Aye, aye; and\\r\\n      powder in the pan;&mdash;that&rsquo;s not good. Best spill it?&mdash;wait. I&rsquo;ll\\r\\n      cure myself of this. I&rsquo;ll hold the musket boldly while I think.&mdash;I\\r\\n      come to report a fair wind to him. But how fair? Fair for death and doom,&mdash;<i>that&rsquo;s</i>\\r\\n      fair for Moby Dick. It&rsquo;s a fair wind that&rsquo;s only fair for that accursed\\r\\n      fish.&mdash;The very tube he pointed at me!&mdash;the very one; <i>this</i> one&mdash;I\\r\\n      hold it here; he would have killed me with the very thing I handle now.&mdash;Aye\\r\\n      and he would fain kill all his crew. Does he not say he will not strike\\r\\n      his spars to any gale? Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in\\r\\n      these same perilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of\\r\\n      the error-abounding log? and in this very Typhoon, did he not swear that\\r\\n      he would have no lightning-rods? But shall this crazed old man be tamely\\r\\n      suffered to drag a whole ship&rsquo;s company down to doom with him?&mdash;Yes,\\r\\n      it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more, if this ship\\r\\n      come to any deadly harm; and come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship\\r\\n      will, if Ahab have his way. If, then, he were this instant&mdash;put\\r\\n      aside, that crime would not be his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes,\\r\\n      just there,&mdash;in there, he&rsquo;s sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive,\\r\\n      and soon awake again. I can&rsquo;t withstand thee, then, old man. Not\\r\\n      reasoning; not remonstrance; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this\\r\\n      thou scornest. Flat obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou\\r\\n      breathest. Aye, and say&rsquo;st the men have vow&rsquo;d thy vow; say&rsquo;st all of us\\r\\n      are Ahabs. Great God forbid!&mdash;But is there no other way? no lawful\\r\\n      way?&mdash;Make him a prisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest this\\r\\n      old man&rsquo;s living power from his own living hands? Only a fool would try\\r\\n      it. Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers;\\r\\n      chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more hideous\\r\\n      than a caged tiger, then. I could not endure the sight; could not possibly\\r\\n      fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would\\r\\n      leave me on the long intolerable voyage. What, then, remains? The land is\\r\\n      hundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan the nearest. I stand alone here\\r\\n      upon an open sea, with two oceans and a whole continent between me and\\r\\n      law.&mdash;Aye, aye, &rsquo;tis so.&mdash;Is heaven a murderer when its\\r\\n      lightning strikes a would-be murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and\\r\\n      skin together?&mdash;And would I be a murderer, then, if&rdquo;&mdash;and\\r\\n      slowly, stealthily, and half sideways looking, he placed the loaded\\r\\n      musket&rsquo;s end against the door.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;On this level, Ahab&rsquo;s hammock swings within; his head this way. A touch,\\r\\n      and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.&mdash;Oh Mary!\\r\\n      Mary!&mdash;boy! boy! boy!&mdash;But if I wake thee not to death, old man,\\r\\n      who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck&rsquo;s body this day week may\\r\\n      sink, with all the crew! Great God, where art Thou? Shall I? shall I?&mdash;The\\r\\n      wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and main topsails are reefed\\r\\n      and set; she heads her course.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Stern all! Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man&rsquo;s\\r\\n      tormented sleep, as if Starbuck&rsquo;s voice had caused the long dumb dream to\\r\\n      speak.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard&rsquo;s arm against the panel;\\r\\n      Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from the door, he\\r\\n      placed the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and tell\\r\\n      him.

The Needle.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of\\r\\n      mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod&rsquo;s gurgling track, pushed her on\\r\\n      like giants&rsquo; palms outspread. The strong, unstaggering breeze abounded so,\\r\\n      that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world boomed\\r\\n      before the wind. Muffled in the full morning light, the invisible sun was\\r\\n      only known by the spread intensity of his place; where his bayonet rays\\r\\n      moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned Babylonian kings and\\r\\n      queens, reigned over everything. The sea was as a crucible of molten gold,\\r\\n      that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time\\r\\n      the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to eye\\r\\n      the bright sun&rsquo;s rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly settled by\\r\\n      the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun&rsquo;s rearward place, and how the\\r\\n      same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot of\\r\\n      the sun. Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun to ye!\\r\\n      Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the sea!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards the\\r\\n      helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;East-sou-east, sir,&rdquo; said the frightened steersman.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Thou liest!&rdquo; smiting him with his clenched fist. &ldquo;Heading East at this\\r\\n      hour in the morning, and the sun astern?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then observed\\r\\n      by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very blinding\\r\\n      palpableness must have been the cause.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one glimpse of\\r\\n      the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he almost seemed\\r\\n      to stagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two compasses\\r\\n      pointed East, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the old\\r\\n      man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, &ldquo;I have it! It has happened before. Mr.\\r\\n      Starbuck, last night&rsquo;s thunder turned our compasses&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. Thou\\r\\n      hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,&rdquo; said the pale mate,\\r\\n      gloomily.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than\\r\\n      one case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as\\r\\n      developed in the mariner&rsquo;s needle, is, as all know, essentially one with\\r\\n      the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much marvelled at,\\r\\n      that such things should be. Instances where the lightning has actually\\r\\n      struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging, the\\r\\n      effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal; all its\\r\\n      loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before magnetic steel was\\r\\n      of no more use than an old wife&rsquo;s knitting needle. But in either case, the\\r\\n      needle never again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or\\r\\n      lost; and if the binnacle compasses be affected, the same fate reaches all\\r\\n      the others that may be in the ship; even were the lowermost one inserted\\r\\n      into the kelson.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed\\r\\n      compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took the\\r\\n      precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were exactly\\r\\n      inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship&rsquo;s course to be changed\\r\\n      accordingly. The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod thrust her\\r\\n      undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair one had only\\r\\n      been juggling her.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said nothing,\\r\\n      but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and Flask&mdash;who\\r\\n      in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings&mdash;likewise\\r\\n      unmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though some of them lowly\\r\\n      rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate. But as\\r\\n      ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed; or\\r\\n      if impressed, it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their\\r\\n      congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab&rsquo;s.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But chancing\\r\\n      to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper sight-tubes of the\\r\\n      quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun&rsquo;s pilot! yesterday I wrecked thee,\\r\\n      and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. So, so. But Ahab is\\r\\n      lord over the level loadstone yet. Mr. Starbuck&mdash;a lance without a\\r\\n      pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker&rsquo;s needles. Quick!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to\\r\\n      do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to\\r\\n      revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a\\r\\n      matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old man\\r\\n      well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily\\r\\n      practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors,\\r\\n      without some shudderings and evil portents.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Men,&rdquo; said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed him the\\r\\n      things he had demanded, &ldquo;my men, the thunder turned old Ahab&rsquo;s needles;\\r\\n      but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own, that will point\\r\\n      as true as any.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as this\\r\\n      was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might\\r\\n      follow. But Starbuck looked away.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the\\r\\n      lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade him\\r\\n      hold it upright, without its touching the deck. Then, with the maul, after\\r\\n      repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he placed the blunted\\r\\n      needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly hammered that, several\\r\\n      times, the mate still holding the rod as before. Then going through some\\r\\n      small strange motions with it&mdash;whether indispensable to the\\r\\n      magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to augment the awe of the\\r\\n      crew, is uncertain&mdash;he called for linen thread; and moving to the\\r\\n      binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there, and horizontally\\r\\n      suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of the compass-cards. At\\r\\n      first, the steel went round and round, quivering and vibrating at either\\r\\n      end; but at last it settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been intently\\r\\n      watching for this result, stepped frankly back from the binnacle, and\\r\\n      pointing his stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,&mdash;&ldquo;Look ye, for\\r\\n      yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone! The sun is East,\\r\\n      and that compass swears it!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could\\r\\n      persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk away.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his fatal\\r\\n      pride.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0125\" id=\"link2HCH0125\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 125. The Log and Line.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log\\r\\n      and line had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident reliance\\r\\n      upon other means of determining the vessel&rsquo;s place, some merchantmen, and\\r\\n      many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave the log;\\r\\n      though at the same time, and frequently more for form&rsquo;s sake than anything\\r\\n      else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate the course steered\\r\\n      by the ship, as well as the presumed average rate of progression every\\r\\n      hour. It had been thus with the Pequod. The wooden reel and angular log\\r\\n      attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the railing of the after\\r\\n      bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; sun and wind had warped it; all\\r\\n      the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly. But heedless\\r\\n      of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he happened to glance upon the reel,\\r\\n      not many hours after the magnet scene, and he remembered how his quadrant\\r\\n      was no more, and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line.\\r\\n      The ship was sailing plungingly; astern the billows rolled in riots.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Forward, there! Heave the log!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Two seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman. &ldquo;Take\\r\\n      the reel, one of ye, I&rsquo;ll heave.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship&rsquo;s lee side, where the\\r\\n      deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into the\\r\\n      creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting\\r\\n      handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so\\r\\n      stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty\\r\\n      turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old\\r\\n      Manxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to\\r\\n      speak.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have\\r\\n      spoiled it.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;&rsquo;Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they spoiled thee?\\r\\n      Thou seem&rsquo;st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not thou it.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With these grey hairs\\r\\n      of mine &rsquo;tis not worth while disputing, &rsquo;specially with a superior, who&rsquo;ll\\r\\n      ne&rsquo;er confess.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? There now&rsquo;s a patched professor in Queen Nature&rsquo;s\\r\\n      granite-founded College; but methinks he&rsquo;s too subservient. Where wert\\r\\n      thou born?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Excellent! Thou&rsquo;st hit the world by that.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I know not, sir, but I was born there.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;In the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it&rsquo;s good. Here&rsquo;s a man\\r\\n      from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of Man;\\r\\n      which is sucked in&mdash;by what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind wall\\r\\n      butts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long\\r\\n      dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In\\r\\n      turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing\\r\\n      resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Hold hard!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the tugging\\r\\n      log was gone.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad sea\\r\\n      parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian; reel\\r\\n      up, Manxman. And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and mend\\r\\n      thou the line. See to it.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;There he goes now; to him nothing&rsquo;s happened; but to me, the skewer seems\\r\\n      loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in, Tahitian!\\r\\n      These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and dragging\\r\\n      slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Pip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip&rsquo;s missing.\\r\\n      Let&rsquo;s see now if ye haven&rsquo;t fished him up here, fisherman. It drags hard;\\r\\n      I guess he&rsquo;s holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we haul in no\\r\\n      cowards here. Ho! there&rsquo;s his arm just breaking water. A hatchet! a\\r\\n      hatchet! cut it off&mdash;we haul in no cowards here. Captain Ahab! sir,\\r\\n      sir! here&rsquo;s Pip, trying to get on board again.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Peace, thou crazy loon,&rdquo; cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm. &ldquo;Away\\r\\n      from the quarter-deck!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser,&rdquo; muttered Ahab, advancing.\\r\\n      &ldquo;Hands off from that holiness! Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Astern there, sir, astern! Lo! lo!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And who art thou, boy? I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of\\r\\n      thy eyes. Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve\\r\\n      through!

One hundred\\r\\n      pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high&mdash;looks cowardly&mdash;quickest\\r\\n      known by that! Ding, dong, ding! Who&rsquo;s seen Pip the coward?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;There can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen heavens! look\\r\\n      down here. Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned him, ye\\r\\n      creative libertines. Here, boy; Ahab&rsquo;s cabin shall be Pip&rsquo;s home\\r\\n      henceforth, while Ahab lives. Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy; thou\\r\\n      art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings. Come, let&rsquo;s down.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? here&rsquo;s velvet shark-skin,&rdquo; intently gazing at Ahab&rsquo;s hand,\\r\\n      and feeling it. &ldquo;Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this,\\r\\n      perhaps he had ne&rsquo;er been lost! This seems to me, sir, as a man-rope;\\r\\n      something that weak souls may hold by. Oh, sir, let old Perth now come and\\r\\n      rivet these two hands together; the black one with the white, for I will\\r\\n      not let this go.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse\\r\\n      horrors than are here. Come, then, to my cabin. Lo! ye believers in gods\\r\\n      all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient gods\\r\\n      oblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing not what\\r\\n      he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude. Come! I feel\\r\\n      prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though I grasped an\\r\\n      Emperor&rsquo;s!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;There go two daft ones now,&rdquo; muttered the old Manxman. &ldquo;One daft with\\r\\n      strength, the other daft with weakness. But here&rsquo;s the end of the rotten\\r\\n      line&mdash;all dripping, too. Mend it, eh? I think we had best have a new\\r\\n      line altogether.

The Life-Buoy.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Steering now south-eastward by Ahab&rsquo;s levelled steel, and her progress\\r\\n      solely determined by Ahab&rsquo;s level log and line; the Pequod held on her\\r\\n      path towards the Equator. Making so long a passage through such\\r\\n      unfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways impelled\\r\\n      by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild; all these seemed\\r\\n      the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the\\r\\n      Equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before the\\r\\n      dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch&mdash;then\\r\\n      headed by Flask&mdash;was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and\\r\\n      unearthly&mdash;like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all\\r\\n      Herod&rsquo;s murdered Innocents&mdash;that one and all, they started from their\\r\\n      reveries, and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all\\r\\n      transfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that wild cry\\r\\n      remained within hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the crew said\\r\\n      it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers remained\\r\\n      unappalled. Yet the grey Manxman&mdash;the oldest mariner of all&mdash;declared\\r\\n      that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard, were the voices of newly\\r\\n      drowned men in the sea.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when he\\r\\n      came to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not unaccompanied\\r\\n      with hinted dark meanings. He hollowly laughed, and thus explained the\\r\\n      wonder.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers\\r\\n      of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or some dams that\\r\\n      had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with\\r\\n      her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail. But this only the\\r\\n      more affected some of them, because most mariners cherish a very\\r\\n      superstitious feeling about seals, arising not only from their peculiar\\r\\n      tones when in distress, but also from the human look of their round heads\\r\\n      and semi-intelligent faces, seen peeringly uprising from the water\\r\\n      alongside. In the sea, under certain circumstances, seals have more than\\r\\n      once been mistaken for men.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible\\r\\n      confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning. At sun-rise\\r\\n      this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore; and whether\\r\\n      it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for sailors\\r\\n      sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was thus with the\\r\\n      man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may, he had not been long\\r\\n      at his perch, when a cry was heard&mdash;a cry and a rushing&mdash;and\\r\\n      looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and looking down, a\\r\\n      little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The life-buoy&mdash;a long slender cask&mdash;was dropped from the stern,\\r\\n      where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to\\r\\n      seize it, and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so\\r\\n      that it slowly filled, and that parched wood also filled at its every\\r\\n      pore; and the studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom,\\r\\n      as if to yield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out for\\r\\n      the White Whale, on the White Whale&rsquo;s own peculiar ground; that man was\\r\\n      swallowed up in the deep. But few, perhaps, thought of that at the time.\\r\\n      Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at least as a\\r\\n      portent; for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of evil in the\\r\\n      future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged. They declared\\r\\n      that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the\\r\\n      night before. But again the old Manxman said nay.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see to\\r\\n      it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as in the\\r\\n      feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage,\\r\\n      all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with\\r\\n      its final end, whatever that might prove to be; therefore, they were going\\r\\n      to leave the ship&rsquo;s stern unprovided with a buoy, when by certain strange\\r\\n      signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;A life-buoy of a coffin!&rdquo; cried Starbuck, starting.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Rather queer, that, I should say,&rdquo; said Stubb.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;It will make a good enough one,&rdquo; said Flask, &ldquo;the carpenter here can\\r\\n      arrange it easily.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Bring it up; there&rsquo;s nothing else for it,&rdquo; said Starbuck, after a\\r\\n      melancholy pause. &ldquo;Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so&mdash;the\\r\\n      coffin, I mean. Dost thou hear me? Rig it.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And shall I nail down the lid, sir?&rdquo; moving his hand as with a hammer.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And shall I caulk the seams, sir?&rdquo; moving his hand as with a\\r\\n      caulking-iron.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?&rdquo; moving his hand as\\r\\n      with a pitch-pot.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Away! what possesses thee to this? Make a life-buoy of the coffin, and no\\r\\n      more.&mdash;Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he baulks.\\r\\n      Now I don&rsquo;t like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he wears it like\\r\\n      a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he won&rsquo;t put his head\\r\\n      into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin? And now I&rsquo;m\\r\\n      ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It&rsquo;s like turning an old coat; going to\\r\\n      bring the flesh on the other side now. I don&rsquo;t like this cobbling sort of\\r\\n      business&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like it at all; it&rsquo;s undignified; it&rsquo;s not my\\r\\n      place. Let tinkers&rsquo; brats do tinkerings; we are their betters. I like to\\r\\n      take in hand none but clean, virgin, fair-and-square mathematical jobs,\\r\\n      something that regularly begins at the beginning, and is at the middle\\r\\n      when midway, and comes to an end at the conclusion; not a cobbler&rsquo;s job,\\r\\n      that&rsquo;s at an end in the middle, and at the beginning at the end. It&rsquo;s the\\r\\n      old woman&rsquo;s tricks to be giving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all\\r\\n      old women have for tinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away\\r\\n      with a bald-headed young tinker once. And that&rsquo;s the reason I never would\\r\\n      work for lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my job-shop in the\\r\\n      Vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off\\r\\n      with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let me see.\\r\\n      Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with pitch; batten\\r\\n      them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over the ship&rsquo;s stern.\\r\\n      Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some superstitious old\\r\\n      carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere they would do the\\r\\n      job. But I&rsquo;m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I don&rsquo;t budge. Cruppered\\r\\n      with a coffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard tray! But never mind. We\\r\\n      workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as coffins\\r\\n      and hearses. We work by the month, or by the job, or by the profit; not\\r\\n      for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless it be too\\r\\n      confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can. Hem! I&rsquo;ll do the job,\\r\\n      now, tenderly. I&rsquo;ll have me&mdash;let&rsquo;s see&mdash;how many in the ship&rsquo;s\\r\\n      company, all told? But I&rsquo;ve forgotten. Any way, I&rsquo;ll have me thirty\\r\\n      separate, Turk&rsquo;s-headed life-lines, each three feet long hanging all round\\r\\n      to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down, there&rsquo;ll be thirty lively\\r\\n      fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight not seen very often beneath\\r\\n      the sun! Come hammer, caulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike!

The Pequod Meets The Rachel.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly down\\r\\n      upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. At the time\\r\\n      the Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as the\\r\\n      broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all\\r\\n      fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all life fled from the\\r\\n      smitten hull.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Bad news; she brings bad news,&rdquo; muttered the old Manxman. But ere her\\r\\n      commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he could\\r\\n      hopefully hail, Ahab&rsquo;s voice was heard.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Hast seen the White Whale?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question; and\\r\\n      would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger captain\\r\\n      himself, having stopped his vessel&rsquo;s way, was seen descending her side. A\\r\\n      few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon clinched the Pequod&rsquo;s main-chains,\\r\\n      and he sprang to the deck. Immediately he was recognised by Ahab for a\\r\\n      Nantucketer he knew. But no formal salutation was exchanged.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Where was he?&mdash;not killed!&mdash;not killed!&rdquo; cried Ahab, closely\\r\\n      advancing. &ldquo;How was it?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous, while\\r\\n      three of the stranger&rsquo;s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales, which\\r\\n      had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and while they were\\r\\n      yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head of Moby Dick had\\r\\n      suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to leeward; whereupon,\\r\\n      the fourth rigged boat&mdash;a reserved one&mdash;had been instantly\\r\\n      lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this fourth boat&mdash;the\\r\\n      swiftest keeled of all&mdash;seemed to have succeeded in fastening&mdash;at\\r\\n      least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell anything about it.\\r\\n      In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam\\r\\n      of bubbling white water; and after that nothing more; whence it was\\r\\n      concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his\\r\\n      pursuers, as often happens. There was some apprehension, but no positive\\r\\n      alarm, as yet. The recall signals were placed in the rigging; darkness\\r\\n      came on; and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats&mdash;ere\\r\\n      going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction&mdash;the\\r\\n      ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till\\r\\n      near midnight, but, for the time, to increase her distance from it. But\\r\\n      the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded all sail&mdash;stunsail\\r\\n      on stunsail&mdash;after the missing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots\\r\\n      for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the look-out. But though when\\r\\n      she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of\\r\\n      the absent ones when last seen; though she then paused to lower her spare\\r\\n      boats to pull all around her; and not finding anything, had again dashed\\r\\n      on; again paused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued\\r\\n      doing till daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had\\r\\n      been seen.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his\\r\\n      object in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his own\\r\\n      in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart, on\\r\\n      parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I will wager something now,&rdquo; whispered Stubb to Flask, &ldquo;that some one in\\r\\n      that missing boat wore off that Captain&rsquo;s best coat; mayhap, his watch&mdash;he&rsquo;s\\r\\n      so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two pious whale-ships\\r\\n      cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height of the whaling season?\\r\\n      See, Flask, only see how pale he looks&mdash;pale in the very buttons of\\r\\n      his eyes&mdash;look&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t the coat&mdash;it must have been the&mdash;&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;My boy, my own boy is among them. For God&rsquo;s sake&mdash;I beg, I conjure&rdquo;&mdash;here\\r\\n      exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far had but icily\\r\\n      received his petition. &ldquo;For eight-and-forty hours let me charter your ship&mdash;I\\r\\n      will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for it&mdash;if there be no other\\r\\n      way&mdash;for eight-and-forty hours only&mdash;only that&mdash;you must,\\r\\n      oh, you must, and you <i>shall</i> do this thing.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;His son!&rdquo; cried Stubb, &ldquo;oh, it&rsquo;s his son he&rsquo;s lost! I take back the coat\\r\\n      and watch&mdash;what says Ahab? We must save that boy.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s drowned with the rest on &rsquo;em, last night,&rdquo; said the old Manx sailor\\r\\n      standing behind them; &ldquo;I heard; all of ye heard their spirits.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachel&rsquo;s the\\r\\n      more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the\\r\\n      Captain&rsquo;s sons among the number of the missing boat&rsquo;s crew; but among the\\r\\n      number of the other boat&rsquo;s crews, at the same time, but on the other hand,\\r\\n      separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase, there\\r\\n      had been still another son; as that for a time, the wretched father was\\r\\n      plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity; which was only solved\\r\\n      for him by his chief mate&rsquo;s instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure\\r\\n      of a whale-ship in such emergencies, that is, when placed between\\r\\n      jeopardized but divided boats, always to pick up the majority first. But\\r\\n      the captain, for some unknown constitutional reason, had refrained from\\r\\n      mentioning all this, and not till forced to it by Ahab&rsquo;s iciness did he\\r\\n      allude to his one yet missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old,\\r\\n      whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer&rsquo;s\\r\\n      paternal love, had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and\\r\\n      wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor\\r\\n      does it unfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of\\r\\n      such tender age away from them, for a protracted three or four years&rsquo;\\r\\n      voyage in some other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge of\\r\\n      a whaleman&rsquo;s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a\\r\\n      father&rsquo;s natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and\\r\\n      concern.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab; and\\r\\n      Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without the\\r\\n      least quivering of his own.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I will not go,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;till you say <i>aye</i> to me. Do to me as\\r\\n      you would have me do to you in the like case. For <i>you</i> too have a boy,\\r\\n      Captain Ahab&mdash;though but a child, and nestling safely at home now&mdash;a\\r\\n      child of your old age too&mdash;Yes, yes, you relent; I see it&mdash;run,\\r\\n      run, men, now, and stand by to square in the yards.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Avast,&rdquo; cried Ahab&mdash;&ldquo;touch not a rope-yarn&rdquo;; then in a voice that\\r\\n      prolongingly moulded every word&mdash;&ldquo;Captain Gardiner, I will not do it.\\r\\n      Even now I lose time. Good-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man, and may I\\r\\n      forgive myself, but I must go. Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle watch,\\r\\n      and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers:\\r\\n      then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin, leaving\\r\\n      the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection\\r\\n      of his so earnest suit. But starting from his enchantment, Gardiner\\r\\n      silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his boat, and\\r\\n      returned to his ship.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel\\r\\n      was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,\\r\\n      however small, on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung round;\\r\\n      starboard and larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat against a head\\r\\n      sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the while, her masts and\\r\\n      yards were thickly clustered with men, as three tall cherry trees, when\\r\\n      the boys are cherrying among the boughs.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly saw\\r\\n      that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without comfort.\\r\\n      She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were not.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0129\" id=\"link2HCH0129\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 129.

The Hat.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a\\r\\n      preliminary cruise, Ahab,&mdash;all other whaling waters swept&mdash;seemed\\r\\n      to have chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely\\r\\n      there; now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude\\r\\n      where his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a vessel had been\\r\\n      spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered Moby Dick;&mdash;and\\r\\n      now that all his successive meetings with various ships contrastingly\\r\\n      concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale\\r\\n      tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned against; now it was that there\\r\\n      lurked a something in the old man&rsquo;s eyes, which it was hardly sufferable\\r\\n      for feeble souls to see. As the unsetting polar star, which through the\\r\\n      livelong, arctic, six months&rsquo; night sustains its piercing, steady, central\\r\\n      gaze; so Ahab&rsquo;s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant\\r\\n      midnight of the gloomy crew. It domineered above them so, that all their\\r\\n      bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were fain to hide beneath their souls,\\r\\n      and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,\\r\\n      vanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more strove\\r\\n      to check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed ground to\\r\\n      finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped mortar of Ahab&rsquo;s\\r\\n      iron soul. Like machines, they dumbly moved about the deck, ever conscious\\r\\n      that the old man&rsquo;s despot eye was on them.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when he\\r\\n      thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that even\\r\\n      as Ahab&rsquo;s eyes so awed the crew&rsquo;s, the inscrutable Parsee&rsquo;s glance awed\\r\\n      his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it. Such an\\r\\n      added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now; such\\r\\n      ceaseless shudderings shook him; that the men looked dubious at him; half\\r\\n      uncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal substance, or\\r\\n      else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being&rsquo;s body.\\r\\n      And that shadow was always hovering there. For not by night, even, had\\r\\n      Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go below. He would stand\\r\\n      still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan but wondrous eyes did\\r\\n      plainly say&mdash;We two watchmen never rest.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the\\r\\n      deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole, or\\r\\n      exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,&mdash;the\\r\\n      main-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing in the\\r\\n      cabin-scuttle,&mdash;his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to\\r\\n      step; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless\\r\\n      he stood, however the days and nights were added on, that he had not swung\\r\\n      in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never\\r\\n      tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at\\r\\n      times; or whether he was still intently scanning them; no matter, though\\r\\n      he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and the\\r\\n      unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat\\r\\n      and hat. The clothes that the night had wet, the next day&rsquo;s sunshine dried\\r\\n      upon him; and so, day after day, and night after night; he went no more\\r\\n      beneath the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent\\r\\n      for.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,&mdash;breakfast\\r\\n      and dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly\\r\\n      grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still grow\\r\\n      idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But though\\r\\n      his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the Parsee&rsquo;s\\r\\n      mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these two never\\r\\n      seemed to speak&mdash;one man to the other&mdash;unless at long intervals\\r\\n      some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. Though such a potent\\r\\n      spell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck\\r\\n      crew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced to speak one\\r\\n      word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the slightest\\r\\n      verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours, without a single hail,\\r\\n      they stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by\\r\\n      the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the\\r\\n      Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned\\r\\n      substance.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And yet, somehow, did Ahab&mdash;in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,\\r\\n      and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,&mdash;Ahab\\r\\n      seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both\\r\\n      seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean shade\\r\\n      siding the solid rib. For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and keel was\\r\\n      solid Ahab.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard\\r\\n      from aft,&mdash;&ldquo;Man the mast-heads!&rdquo;&mdash;and all through the day, till\\r\\n      after sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at the\\r\\n      striking of the helmsman&rsquo;s bell, was heard&mdash;&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye see?&mdash;sharp!\\r\\n      sharp!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the\\r\\n      children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac\\r\\n      old man seemed distrustful of his crew&rsquo;s fidelity; at least, of nearly all\\r\\n      except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether Stubb and\\r\\n      Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought. But if these\\r\\n      suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from verbally\\r\\n      expressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I will have the first sight of the whale myself,&rdquo;&mdash;he said. &ldquo;Aye!\\r\\n      Ahab must have the doubloon!&rdquo; and with his own hands he rigged a nest of\\r\\n      basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved block,\\r\\n      to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the\\r\\n      downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for\\r\\n      the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with that end\\r\\n      yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round upon his\\r\\n      crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long upon Daggoo,\\r\\n      Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then settling his firm\\r\\n      relying eye upon the chief mate, said,&mdash;&ldquo;Take the rope, sir&mdash;I\\r\\n      give it into thy hands, Starbuck.&rdquo; Then arranging his person in the\\r\\n      basket, he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck\\r\\n      being the one who secured the rope at last; and afterwards stood near it.\\r\\n      And thus, with one hand clinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad\\r\\n      upon the sea for miles and miles,&mdash;ahead, astern, this side, and\\r\\n      that,&mdash;within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a\\r\\n      height.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the\\r\\n      rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is hoisted\\r\\n      up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these\\r\\n      circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge\\r\\n      to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because in such a\\r\\n      wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations aloft\\r\\n      cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck;\\r\\n      and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast\\r\\n      down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural fatality, if,\\r\\n      unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some\\r\\n      carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea.\\r\\n      So Ahab&rsquo;s proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange\\r\\n      thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who\\r\\n      had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree\\r\\n      approaching to decision&mdash;one of those too, whose faithfulness on the\\r\\n      look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;&mdash;it was strange, that this\\r\\n      was the very man he should select for his watchman; freely giving his\\r\\n      whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person&rsquo;s hands.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten\\r\\n      minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly\\r\\n      incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these\\r\\n      latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head\\r\\n      in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a thousand feet\\r\\n      straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and went eddying\\r\\n      again round his head.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed not\\r\\n      to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked it\\r\\n      much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least heedful\\r\\n      eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Your hat, your hat, sir!&rdquo; suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who being\\r\\n      posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab, though somewhat\\r\\n      lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing them.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But already the sable wing was before the old man&rsquo;s eyes; the long hooked\\r\\n      bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away with his\\r\\n      prize.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin&rsquo;s head, removing his cap to replace it,\\r\\n      and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin would be king of\\r\\n      Rome. But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good.\\r\\n      Ahab&rsquo;s hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on and on with it; far\\r\\n      in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared; while from the point of\\r\\n      that disappearance, a minute black spot was dimly discerned, falling from\\r\\n      that vast height into the sea.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0131\" id=\"link2HCH0131\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 131.

As she drew nigh, all eyes were fixed\\r\\n      upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some whaling-ships, cross\\r\\n      the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine feet; serving to carry the\\r\\n      spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Upon the stranger&rsquo;s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and some\\r\\n      few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you now saw\\r\\n      through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled,\\r\\n      half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Hast seen the White Whale?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with his\\r\\n      trumpet he pointed to the wreck.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Hast killed him?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that,&rdquo; answered the\\r\\n      other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose gathered\\r\\n      sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Not forged!&rdquo; and snatching Perth&rsquo;s levelled iron from the crotch, Ahab\\r\\n      held it out, exclaiming&mdash;&ldquo;Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this hand I\\r\\n      hold his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these\\r\\n      barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin,\\r\\n      where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Then God keep thee, old man&mdash;see&rsquo;st thou that&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to the\\r\\n      hammock&mdash;&ldquo;I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only\\r\\n      yesterday; but were dead ere night.

The firmaments of air and sea were hardly\\r\\n      separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was\\r\\n      transparently pure and soft, with a woman&rsquo;s look, and the robust and\\r\\n      man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson&rsquo;s chest\\r\\n      in his sleep.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,\\r\\n      unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air; but\\r\\n      to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed mighty\\r\\n      leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong, troubled,\\r\\n      murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and\\r\\n      shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were,\\r\\n      that distinguished them.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle air\\r\\n      to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the girdling\\r\\n      line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion&mdash;most seen here at\\r\\n      the equator&mdash;denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving alarms,\\r\\n      with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm and\\r\\n      unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the ashes of\\r\\n      ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn; lifting\\r\\n      his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl&rsquo;s forehead of heaven.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible winged\\r\\n      creatures that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and sky! how\\r\\n      oblivious were ye of old Ahab&rsquo;s close-coiled woe! But so have I seen\\r\\n      little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around\\r\\n      their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the\\r\\n      marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side and\\r\\n      watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the more\\r\\n      and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity. But the lovely\\r\\n      aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a moment, the\\r\\n      cankerous thing in his soul. That glad, happy air, that winsome sky, did\\r\\n      at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother world, so long cruel&mdash;forbidding&mdash;now\\r\\n      threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck, and did seem to joyously\\r\\n      sob over him, as if over one, that however wilful and erring, she could\\r\\n      yet find it in her heart to save and to bless. From beneath his slouched\\r\\n      hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such\\r\\n      wealth as that one wee drop.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side;\\r\\n      and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that\\r\\n      stole out of the centre of the serenity around. Careful not to touch him,\\r\\n      or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood there.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Ahab turned.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Starbuck!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Sir.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky.

Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not spent\\r\\n      three ashore. When I think of this life I have led; the desolation of\\r\\n      solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a Captain&rsquo;s\\r\\n      exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the\\r\\n      green country without&mdash;oh, weariness! heaviness! Guinea-coast slavery\\r\\n      of solitary command!&mdash;when I think of all this; only half-suspected,\\r\\n      not so keenly known to me before&mdash;and how for forty years I have fed\\r\\n      upon dry salted fare&mdash;fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil!&mdash;when\\r\\n      the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and broken the\\r\\n      world&rsquo;s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts&mdash;away, whole oceans away,\\r\\n      from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and sailed for Cape Horn\\r\\n      the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow&mdash;wife? wife?&mdash;rather\\r\\n      a widow with her husband alive! Aye, I widowed that poor girl when I\\r\\n      married her, Starbuck; and then, the madness, the frenzy, the boiling\\r\\n      blood and the smoking brow, with which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab\\r\\n      has furiously, foamingly chased his prey&mdash;more a demon than a man!&mdash;aye,\\r\\n      aye! what a forty years&rsquo; fool&mdash;fool&mdash;old fool, has old Ahab\\r\\n      been! Why this strife of the chase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the\\r\\n      oar, and the iron, and the lance? how the richer or better is Ahab now?\\r\\n      Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard, that with this weary load I bear,\\r\\n      one poor leg should have been snatched from under me? Here, brush this old\\r\\n      hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep. Locks so grey did never\\r\\n      grow but from out some ashes! But do I look very old, so very, very old,\\r\\n      Starbuck? I feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were Adam,\\r\\n      staggering beneath the piled centuries since Paradise. God! God! God!&mdash;crack\\r\\n      my heart!&mdash;stave my brain!&mdash;mockery! mockery! bitter, biting\\r\\n      mockery of grey hairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and\\r\\n      feel thus intolerably old? Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look\\r\\n      into a human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than\\r\\n      to gaze upon God. By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is\\r\\n      the magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no;\\r\\n      stay on board, on board!&mdash;lower not when I do; when branded Ahab\\r\\n      gives chase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with\\r\\n      the far away home I see in that eye!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all! why\\r\\n      should any one give chase to that hated fish!

How\\r\\n      cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl on our way to see\\r\\n      old Nantucket again!

By heaven, man,\\r\\n      we are turned round and round in this world, like yonder windlass, and\\r\\n      Fate is the handspike.

The Chase&mdash;First Day.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man&mdash;as his wont at\\r\\n      intervals&mdash;stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and\\r\\n      went to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing\\r\\n      up the sea air as a sagacious ship&rsquo;s dog will, in drawing nigh to some\\r\\n      barbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that peculiar\\r\\n      odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale,\\r\\n      was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner surprised when, after\\r\\n      inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane, and then ascertaining the\\r\\n      precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered\\r\\n      the ship&rsquo;s course to be slightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at\\r\\n      daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise\\r\\n      ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles\\r\\n      bordering it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift tide-rip, at\\r\\n      the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle\\r\\n      deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed\\r\\n      to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear with their\\r\\n      clothes in their hands.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye see?&rdquo; cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Nothing, nothing sir!&rdquo; was the sound hailing down in reply.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;T&rsquo;gallant sails!&mdash;stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for swaying\\r\\n      him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were hoisting\\r\\n      him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and while\\r\\n      peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main-top-sail and\\r\\n      top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the air. &ldquo;There she blows!&mdash;there\\r\\n      she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is Moby Dick!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three\\r\\n      look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous\\r\\n      whale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final perch,\\r\\n      some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just beneath him on\\r\\n      the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian&rsquo;s head was almost on a\\r\\n      level with Ahab&rsquo;s heel. From this height the whale was now seen some mile\\r\\n      or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump,\\r\\n      and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air. To the credulous\\r\\n      mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in\\r\\n      the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And did none of ye see it before?&rdquo; cried Ahab, hailing the perched men\\r\\n      all around him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I\\r\\n      cried out,&rdquo; said Tashtego.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Not the same instant; not the same&mdash;no, the doubloon is mine, Fate\\r\\n      reserved the doubloon for me. <i>I</i> only; none of ye could have raised the\\r\\n      White Whale first. There she blows!&mdash;there she blows!&mdash;there she\\r\\n      blows! There again!&mdash;there again!&rdquo; he cried, in long-drawn,\\r\\n      lingering, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the\\r\\n      whale&rsquo;s visible jets. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to sound! In stunsails! Down\\r\\n      top-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay on\\r\\n      board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So; steady, man,\\r\\n      steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All ready the boats\\r\\n      there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck; lower, lower,&mdash;quick,\\r\\n      quicker!&rdquo; and he slid through the air to the deck.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;He is heading straight to leeward, sir,&rdquo; cried Stubb, &ldquo;right away from\\r\\n      us; cannot have seen the ship yet.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!&mdash;brace up!\\r\\n      Shiver her!&mdash;shiver her!&mdash;So; well that! Boats, boats!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Soon all the boats but Starbuck&rsquo;s were dropped; all the boat-sails set&mdash;all\\r\\n      the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward; and Ahab\\r\\n      heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah&rsquo;s sunken eyes; a\\r\\n      hideous motion gnawed his mouth.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;\\r\\n      but only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew\\r\\n      still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a\\r\\n      noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter came\\r\\n      so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump was\\r\\n      distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing, and\\r\\n      continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish foam. He\\r\\n      saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond.\\r\\n      Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening\\r\\n      white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully\\r\\n      accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed\\r\\n      over into the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright\\r\\n      bubbles arose and danced by his side. But these were broken again by the\\r\\n      light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate\\r\\n      with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the\\r\\n      painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance\\r\\n      projected from the white whale&rsquo;s back; and at intervals one of the cloud\\r\\n      of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over\\r\\n      the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers\\r\\n      streaming like pennons.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      A gentle joyousness&mdash;a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness,\\r\\n      invested the gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with\\r\\n      ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering eyes\\r\\n      sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness, rippling\\r\\n      straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that great majesty\\r\\n      Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so divinely swam.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      On each soft side&mdash;coincident with the parted swell, that but once\\r\\n      leaving him, then flowed so wide away&mdash;on each bright side, the whale\\r\\n      shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who\\r\\n      namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured to\\r\\n      assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of\\r\\n      tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all who\\r\\n      for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way thou\\r\\n      may&rsquo;st have bejuggled and destroyed before.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among\\r\\n      waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby Dick\\r\\n      moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged\\r\\n      trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw. But soon the\\r\\n      fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an instant his whole\\r\\n      marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia&rsquo;s Natural Bridge, and\\r\\n      warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air, the grand god revealed\\r\\n      himself, sounded, and went out of sight. Hoveringly halting, and dipping\\r\\n      on the wing, the white sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool\\r\\n      that he left.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the\\r\\n      three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick&rsquo;s reappearance.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;An hour,&rdquo; said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat&rsquo;s stern; and he gazed\\r\\n      beyond the whale&rsquo;s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing\\r\\n      vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed\\r\\n      whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze now\\r\\n      freshened; the sea began to swell.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The birds!&mdash;the birds!&rdquo; cried Tashtego.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now\\r\\n      all flying towards Ahab&rsquo;s boat; and when within a few yards began\\r\\n      fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,\\r\\n      expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man&rsquo;s; Ahab could discover\\r\\n      no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down into its\\r\\n      depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white\\r\\n      weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it rose, till\\r\\n      it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of\\r\\n      white, glistening teeth, floating up from the undiscoverable bottom. It\\r\\n      was Moby Dick&rsquo;s open mouth and scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still\\r\\n      half blending with the blue of the sea. The glittering mouth yawned\\r\\n      beneath the boat like an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong\\r\\n      sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this\\r\\n      tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with\\r\\n      him, went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth&rsquo;s harpoon, commanded his\\r\\n      crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis, its\\r\\n      bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale&rsquo;s head while yet under\\r\\n      water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that malicious\\r\\n      intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted himself, as it were,\\r\\n      in an instant, shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for an\\r\\n      instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a biting\\r\\n      shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth, so that\\r\\n      the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air, and\\r\\n      one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish pearl-white of the\\r\\n      inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab&rsquo;s head, and reached higher\\r\\n      than that. In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as\\r\\n      a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and\\r\\n      crossed his arms; but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each\\r\\n      other&rsquo;s heads to gain the uttermost stern.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the\\r\\n      whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his\\r\\n      body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from the\\r\\n      bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while the\\r\\n      other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis impossible to\\r\\n      withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with this tantalizing\\r\\n      vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and helpless in the very\\r\\n      jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized the long bone with his\\r\\n      naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe. As now he thus\\r\\n      vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent in,\\r\\n      collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding\\r\\n      further aft, bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast\\r\\n      again in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks. These floated\\r\\n      aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging to\\r\\n      the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first to\\r\\n      perceive the whale&rsquo;s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a\\r\\n      movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had\\r\\n      made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only slipping\\r\\n      further into the whale&rsquo;s mouth, and tilting over sideways as it slipped,\\r\\n      the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him out of it, as he\\r\\n      leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the sea.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little\\r\\n      distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the\\r\\n      billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body; so\\r\\n      that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose&mdash;some twenty or more feet\\r\\n      out of the water&mdash;the now rising swells, with all their confluent\\r\\n      waves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered\\r\\n      spray still higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled\\r\\n      Channel billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly\\r\\n      to overleap its summit with their scud.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      *This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its designation\\r\\n      (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down poise\\r\\n      of the whale-lance, in the exercise called pitchpoling, previously\\r\\n      described. By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively\\r\\n      view whatever objects may be encircling him.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round\\r\\n      and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful\\r\\n      wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault.\\r\\n      The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of\\r\\n      grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus&rsquo;s elephants in the book of\\r\\n      Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale&rsquo;s\\r\\n      insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,&mdash;though he could\\r\\n      still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that; helpless\\r\\n      Ahab&rsquo;s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock\\r\\n      might burst. From the boat&rsquo;s fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and\\r\\n      mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not\\r\\n      succor him; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves. For so\\r\\n      revolvingly appalling was the White Whale&rsquo;s aspect, and so planetarily\\r\\n      swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he seemed horizontally\\r\\n      swooping upon them. And though the other boats, unharmed, still hovered\\r\\n      hard by; still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike, lest that\\r\\n      should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized\\r\\n      castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that case could they themselves hope to\\r\\n      escape. With straining eyes, then, they remained on the outer edge of the\\r\\n      direful zone, whose centre had now become the old man&rsquo;s head.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship&rsquo;s\\r\\n      mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene; and\\r\\n      was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!&mdash;&ldquo;Sail on the&rdquo;&mdash;but\\r\\n      that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and whelmed him\\r\\n      for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing to rise on a\\r\\n      towering crest, he shouted,&mdash;&ldquo;Sail on the whale!&mdash;Drive him\\r\\n      off!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The Pequod&rsquo;s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle, she\\r\\n      effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly swam\\r\\n      off, the boats flew to the rescue.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Dragged into Stubb&rsquo;s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white brine\\r\\n      caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab&rsquo;s bodily strength did\\r\\n      crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body&rsquo;s doom: for a time, lying all\\r\\n      crushed in the bottom of Stubb&rsquo;s boat, like one trodden under foot of\\r\\n      herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from him, as desolate\\r\\n      sounds from out ravines.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more\\r\\n      abbreviate it. In an instant&rsquo;s compass, great hearts sometimes condense to\\r\\n      one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused\\r\\n      through feebler men&rsquo;s whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary in\\r\\n      each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time\\r\\n      aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous intensities;\\r\\n      for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures contain the\\r\\n      entire circumferences of inferior souls.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The harpoon,&rdquo; said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on one\\r\\n      bended arm&mdash;&ldquo;is it safe?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,&rdquo; said Stubb, showing it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Lay it before me;&mdash;any missing men?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;One, two, three, four, five;&mdash;there were five oars, sir, and here\\r\\n      are five men.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&mdash;Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him!\\r\\n      there! there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!&mdash;Hands\\r\\n      off from me! The eternal sap runs up in Ahab&rsquo;s bones again! Set the sail;\\r\\n      out oars; the helm!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked up\\r\\n      by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is thus\\r\\n      continued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now. But the\\r\\n      added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale, for he\\r\\n      seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with a velocity which\\r\\n      plainly showed, that if now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the\\r\\n      chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor\\r\\n      could any crew endure for so long a period, such an unintermitted, intense\\r\\n      straining at the oar; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief\\r\\n      vicissitude. The ship itself, then, as it sometimes happens, offered the\\r\\n      most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase. Accordingly,\\r\\n      the boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up to their cranes&mdash;the\\r\\n      two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her&mdash;and\\r\\n      then hoisting everything to her side, and stacking her canvas high up, and\\r\\n      sideways outstretching it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings\\r\\n      of an albatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At\\r\\n      the well known, methodic intervals, the whale&rsquo;s glittering spout was\\r\\n      regularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be\\r\\n      reported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the\\r\\n      deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the allotted\\r\\n      hour expired, his voice was heard.&mdash;&ldquo;Whose is the doubloon now? D&rsquo;ye\\r\\n      see him?&rdquo; and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he commanded them to\\r\\n      lift him to his perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now aloft and\\r\\n      motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men aloft,\\r\\n      or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a still\\r\\n      greater breadth&mdash;thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat, at\\r\\n      every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped upon the\\r\\n      quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered stern. At\\r\\n      last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded sky fresh\\r\\n      troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old man&rsquo;s face\\r\\n      there now stole some such added gloom as this.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to evince\\r\\n      his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in his\\r\\n      Captain&rsquo;s mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;The\\r\\n      thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck? Man, man! did I\\r\\n      not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I could swear\\r\\n      thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, sir,&rdquo; said Starbuck drawing near, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a solemn sight; an omen, and\\r\\n      an ill one.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Omen? omen?&mdash;the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to\\r\\n      man, they will honorably speak outright; not shake their heads, and give\\r\\n      an old wives&rsquo; darkling hint.&mdash;Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles\\r\\n      of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye\\r\\n      two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the\\r\\n      peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold&mdash;I shiver!&mdash;How\\r\\n      now? Aloft there! D&rsquo;ye see him? Sing out for every spout, though he spout\\r\\n      ten times a second!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling.\\r\\n      Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see the spout now, sir;&mdash;too dark&rdquo;&mdash;cried a voice from\\r\\n      the air.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;How heading when last seen?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;As before, sir,&mdash;straight to leeward.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Good! he will travel slower now &rsquo;tis night. Down royals and top-gallant\\r\\n      stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over him before morning; he&rsquo;s\\r\\n      making a passage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm there! keep her full\\r\\n      before the wind!&mdash;Aloft! come down!&mdash;Mr. Stubb, send a fresh\\r\\n      hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till morning.&rdquo;&mdash;Then\\r\\n      advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast&mdash;&ldquo;Men, this gold is\\r\\n      mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide here till the White Whale\\r\\n      is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises him, upon the day he shall\\r\\n      be killed, this gold is that man&rsquo;s; and if on that day I shall again raise\\r\\n      him, then, ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye! Away now!&mdash;the\\r\\n      deck is thine, sir!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and\\r\\n      slouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals rousing\\r\\n      himself to see how the night wore on.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0134\" id=\"link2HCH0134\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 134. The Chase&mdash;Second Day.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye see him?&rdquo; cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light to\\r\\n      spread.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;See nothing, sir.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought for;&mdash;the\\r\\n      top-gallant sails!&mdash;aye, they should have been kept on her all night.\\r\\n      But no matter&mdash;&rsquo;tis but resting for the rush.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale,\\r\\n      continued through day into night, and through night into day, is a thing\\r\\n      by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is the\\r\\n      wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible confidence\\r\\n      acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders;\\r\\n      that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried, they will,\\r\\n      under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both the\\r\\n      direction in which he will continue to swim for a time, while out of\\r\\n      sight, as well as his probable rate of progression during that period.\\r\\n      And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a\\r\\n      coast, whose general trending he well knows, and which he desires shortly\\r\\n      to return to again, but at some further point; like as this pilot stands\\r\\n      by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present\\r\\n      visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen\\r\\n      headland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass,\\r\\n      with the whale; for after being chased, and diligently marked, through\\r\\n      several hours of daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the\\r\\n      creature&rsquo;s future wake through the darkness is almost as established to\\r\\n      the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the pilot&rsquo;s coast is to him. So that\\r\\n      to this hunter&rsquo;s wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing\\r\\n      writ in water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as\\r\\n      the steadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway\\r\\n      is so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their\\r\\n      hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby&rsquo;s pulse; and lightly\\r\\n      say of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot,\\r\\n      at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when these\\r\\n      Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to the\\r\\n      observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many hours hence\\r\\n      this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about reached this\\r\\n      or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to render this acuteness at\\r\\n      all successful in the end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman&rsquo;s\\r\\n      allies; for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is\\r\\n      the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a\\r\\n      quarter from his port? Inferable from these statements, are many\\r\\n      collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon-ball,\\r\\n      missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level field.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;By salt and hemp!&rdquo; cried Stubb, &ldquo;but this swift motion of the deck creeps\\r\\n      up one&rsquo;s legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I are two brave\\r\\n      fellows!&mdash;Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise, on\\r\\n      the sea,&mdash;for by live-oaks! my spine&rsquo;s a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait\\r\\n      that leaves no dust behind!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;There she blows&mdash;she blows!&mdash;she blows!&mdash;right ahead!&rdquo; was\\r\\n      now the mast-head cry.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, aye!&rdquo; cried Stubb, &ldquo;I knew it&mdash;ye can&rsquo;t escape&mdash;blow on\\r\\n      and split your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow\\r\\n      your trump&mdash;blister your lungs!&mdash;Ahab will dam off your blood,\\r\\n      as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies of\\r\\n      the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine worked\\r\\n      anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt\\r\\n      before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe\\r\\n      of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed, as timid\\r\\n      prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand of Fate had\\r\\n      snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the previous day;\\r\\n      the rack of the past night&rsquo;s suspense; the fixed, unfearing, blind,\\r\\n      reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying\\r\\n      mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled along. The wind that\\r\\n      made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the vessel on by arms\\r\\n      invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency\\r\\n      which so enslaved them to the race.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      They were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all;\\r\\n      though it was put together of all contrasting things&mdash;oak, and maple,\\r\\n      and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp&mdash;yet all these ran into each\\r\\n      other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced and\\r\\n      directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities of the\\r\\n      crew, this man&rsquo;s valor, that man&rsquo;s fear; guilt and guiltiness, all\\r\\n      varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that fatal\\r\\n      goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were\\r\\n      outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one\\r\\n      hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others, shading\\r\\n      their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking yards; all\\r\\n      the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for their fate. Ah!\\r\\n      how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing\\r\\n      that might destroy them!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?&rdquo; cried Ahab, when, after the\\r\\n      lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard. &ldquo;Sway\\r\\n      me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd jet that\\r\\n      way, and then disappears.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some\\r\\n      other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for\\r\\n      hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its pin\\r\\n      on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the air\\r\\n      vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant halloo\\r\\n      of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as&mdash;much nearer to the ship than\\r\\n      the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead&mdash;Moby Dick\\r\\n      bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not by\\r\\n      the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the White\\r\\n      Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of\\r\\n      breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths, the\\r\\n      Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air, and\\r\\n      piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of\\r\\n      seven miles and more. In those moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes\\r\\n      off, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his act of defiance.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;There she breaches! there she breaches!&rdquo; was the cry, as in his\\r\\n      immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to\\r\\n      Heaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved\\r\\n      against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised, for\\r\\n      the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and stood\\r\\n      there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity,\\r\\n      to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!&rdquo; cried Ahab, &ldquo;thy hour and\\r\\n      thy harpoon are at hand!&mdash;Down! down all of ye, but one man at the\\r\\n      fore. The boats!&mdash;stand by!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like\\r\\n      shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and halyards;\\r\\n      while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped from his perch.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Lower away,&rdquo; he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat&mdash;a spare\\r\\n      one, rigged the afternoon previous. &ldquo;Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine&mdash;keep\\r\\n      away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first\\r\\n      assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the three\\r\\n      crews. Ahab&rsquo;s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told them he\\r\\n      would take the whale head-and-head,&mdash;that is, pull straight up to his\\r\\n      forehead,&mdash;a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,\\r\\n      such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale&rsquo;s sidelong vision.\\r\\n      But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three boats were\\r\\n      plain as the ship&rsquo;s three masts to his eye; the White Whale churning\\r\\n      himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were, rushing among\\r\\n      the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered appalling battle on\\r\\n      every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat,\\r\\n      seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those\\r\\n      boats were made. But skilfully manÅ\\x93uvred, incessantly wheeling like\\r\\n      trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though,\\r\\n      at times, but by a plank&rsquo;s breadth; while all the time, Ahab&rsquo;s unearthly\\r\\n      slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed and\\r\\n      recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines\\r\\n      now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves, warped the\\r\\n      devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now for a moment\\r\\n      the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more tremendous\\r\\n      charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more line: and then\\r\\n      was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again&mdash;hoping that way to\\r\\n      disencumber it of some snarls&mdash;when lo!&mdash;a sight more savage\\r\\n      than the embattled teeth of sharks!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Caught and twisted&mdash;corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose\\r\\n      harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came\\r\\n      flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab&rsquo;s boat. Only\\r\\n      one thing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached\\r\\n      within&mdash;through&mdash;and then, without&mdash;the rays of steel;\\r\\n      dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then,\\r\\n      twice sundering the rope near the chocks&mdash;dropped the intercepted\\r\\n      fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the\\r\\n      White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other\\r\\n      lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb\\r\\n      and Flask towards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks\\r\\n      on a surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in\\r\\n      a boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the\\r\\n      wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred\\r\\n      bowl of punch.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after\\r\\n      the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while aslope\\r\\n      little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching his legs\\r\\n      upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was lustily\\r\\n      singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old man&rsquo;s line&mdash;now\\r\\n      parting&mdash;admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom\\r\\n      he could;&mdash;in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted\\r\\n      perils,&mdash;Ahab&rsquo;s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards Heaven by\\r\\n      invisible wires,&mdash;as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly from the\\r\\n      sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom, and\\r\\n      sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell again&mdash;gunwale\\r\\n      downwards&mdash;and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it, like\\r\\n      seals from a sea-side cave.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The first uprising momentum of the whale&mdash;modifying its direction as\\r\\n      he struck the surface&mdash;involuntarily launched him along it, to a\\r\\n      little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with\\r\\n      his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes\\r\\n      from side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip\\r\\n      or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and\\r\\n      came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work for\\r\\n      that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean, and\\r\\n      trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his leeward way at a\\r\\n      traveller&rsquo;s methodic pace.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again came\\r\\n      bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the floating\\r\\n      mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at, and safely\\r\\n      landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and ankles;\\r\\n      livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances; inextricable intricacies\\r\\n      of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these were there; but no fatal or\\r\\n      even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one. As with Fedallah the day\\r\\n      before, so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boat&rsquo;s broken half,\\r\\n      which afforded a comparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as\\r\\n      the previous day&rsquo;s mishap.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as\\r\\n      instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of\\r\\n      Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory leg\\r\\n      had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, aye, Starbuck, &rsquo;tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he\\r\\n      will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The ferrule has not stood, sir,&rdquo; said the carpenter, now coming up; &ldquo;I\\r\\n      put good work into that leg.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;But no bones broken, sir, I hope,&rdquo; said Stubb with true concern.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!&mdash;d&rsquo;ye see it.&mdash;But\\r\\n      even with a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living\\r\\n      bone of mine one jot more me, than this dead one that&rsquo;s lost. Nor white\\r\\n      whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper\\r\\n      and inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape\\r\\n      yonder roof?&mdash;Aloft there! which way?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Dead to leeward, sir.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of the\\r\\n      spare boats and rig them&mdash;Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the boat&rsquo;s\\r\\n      crews.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the\\r\\n      unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;My body, man, not thee.

By\\r\\n      heaven it cannot be!&mdash;missing?&mdash;quick! call them all.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The old man&rsquo;s hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the\\r\\n      Parsee was not there.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The Parsee!&rdquo; cried Stubb&mdash;&ldquo;he must have been caught in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The black vomit wrench thee!&mdash;run all of ye above, alow, cabin,\\r\\n      forecastle&mdash;find him&mdash;not gone&mdash;not gone!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was\\r\\n      nowhere to be found.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, sir,&rdquo; said Stubb&mdash;&ldquo;caught among the tangles of your line&mdash;I\\r\\n      thought I saw him dragging under.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;<i>My</i> line! <i>my</i> line?

I&rsquo;ll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and dive\\r\\n      straight through it, but I&rsquo;ll slay him yet!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Great God! but for one single instant show thyself,&rdquo; cried Starbuck;\\r\\n      &ldquo;never, never wilt thou capture him, old man&mdash;In Jesus&rsquo; name no more\\r\\n      of this, that&rsquo;s worse than devil&rsquo;s madness. Two days chased; twice stove\\r\\n      to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil\\r\\n      shadow gone&mdash;all good angels mobbing thee with warnings:&mdash;what more\\r\\n      wouldst thou have?&mdash;Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps\\r\\n      the last man? Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea? Shall we be\\r\\n      towed by him to the infernal world? Oh, oh,&mdash;Impiety and blasphemy to hunt\\r\\n      him more!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Starbuck, of late I&rsquo;ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that hour\\r\\n      we both saw&mdash;thou know&rsquo;st what, in one another&rsquo;s eyes. But in this\\r\\n      matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this\\r\\n      hand&mdash;a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This\\r\\n      whole act&rsquo;s immutably decreed. &rsquo;Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion\\r\\n      years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates&rsquo; lieutenant; I act\\r\\n      under orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine.&mdash;Stand\\r\\n      round me, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a\\r\\n      shivered lance; propped up on a lonely foot. &rsquo;Tis Ahab&mdash;his body&rsquo;s\\r\\n      part; but Ahab&rsquo;s soul&rsquo;s a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I\\r\\n      feel strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a\\r\\n      gale; and I may look so. But ere I break, ye&rsquo;ll hear me crack; and till ye\\r\\n      hear <i>that</i>, know that Ahab&rsquo;s hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe ye, men,\\r\\n      in the things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore! For ere they\\r\\n      drown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface; then rise again, to\\r\\n      sink for evermore. So with Moby Dick&mdash;two days he&rsquo;s floated&mdash;tomorrow\\r\\n      will be the third. Aye, men, he&rsquo;ll rise once more,&mdash;but only to spout\\r\\n      his last! D&rsquo;ye feel brave men, brave?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;As fearless fire,&rdquo; cried Stubb.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;And as mechanical,&rdquo; muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he\\r\\n      muttered on: &ldquo;The things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same to\\r\\n      Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek to\\r\\n      drive out of others&rsquo; hearts what&rsquo;s clinched so fast in mine!&mdash;The\\r\\n      Parsee&mdash;the Parsee!&mdash;gone, gone? and he was to go before:&mdash;but\\r\\n      still was to be seen again ere I could perish&mdash;How&rsquo;s that?&mdash;There&rsquo;s\\r\\n      a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the\\r\\n      whole line of judges:&mdash;like a hawk&rsquo;s beak it pecks my brain. <i>I&rsquo;ll</i>,\\r\\n      <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> solve it, though!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as on\\r\\n      the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the\\r\\n      grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by lanterns\\r\\n      in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening\\r\\n      their fresh weapons for the morrow. Meantime, of the broken keel of Ahab&rsquo;s\\r\\n      wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while still as on the\\r\\n      night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle; his hid,\\r\\n      heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial; sat due\\r\\n      eastward for the earliest sun.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2HCH0135\" id=\"link2HCH0135\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      CHAPTER 135. The Chase.&mdash;Third Day.\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the\\r\\n      solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the\\r\\n      daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye see him?&rdquo; cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that&rsquo;s all. Helm\\r\\n      there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day\\r\\n      again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the\\r\\n      angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a fairer\\r\\n      day could not dawn upon that world. Here&rsquo;s food for thought, had Ahab time\\r\\n      to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels; <i>that&rsquo;s</i>\\r\\n      tingling enough for mortal man! to think&rsquo;s audacity. God only has that\\r\\n      right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a\\r\\n      calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for\\r\\n      that. And yet, I&rsquo;ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm&mdash;frozen\\r\\n      calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents turned\\r\\n      to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing now; this moment\\r\\n      growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it&rsquo;s like that sort of common\\r\\n      grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice\\r\\n      or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow it; they whip it about me as\\r\\n      the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to. A vile\\r\\n      wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells,\\r\\n      and wards of hospitals, and ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither\\r\\n      as innocent as fleeces. Out upon it!&mdash;it&rsquo;s tainted. Were I the wind,\\r\\n      I&rsquo;d blow no more on such a wicked, miserable world. I&rsquo;d crawl somewhere to\\r\\n      a cave, and slink there. And yet, &rsquo;tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind!\\r\\n      who ever conquered it? In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow.\\r\\n      Run tilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a coward wind that\\r\\n      strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow. Even\\r\\n      Ahab is a braver thing&mdash;a nobler thing than <i>that</i>. Would now the wind\\r\\n      but had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal\\r\\n      man, all these things are bodiless, but only bodiless as objects, not as\\r\\n      agents. There&rsquo;s a most special, a most cunning, oh, a most malicious\\r\\n      difference! And yet, I say again, and swear it now, that there&rsquo;s something\\r\\n      all glorious and gracious in the wind. These warm Trade Winds, at least,\\r\\n      that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast,\\r\\n      vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark, however the baser\\r\\n      currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of the\\r\\n      land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go at last. And by the\\r\\n      eternal Poles! these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on;\\r\\n      these Trades, or something like them&mdash;something so unchangeable, and\\r\\n      full as strong, blow my keeled soul along! To it! Aloft there! What d&rsquo;ye\\r\\n      see?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Nothing, sir.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Nothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See the sun! Aye,\\r\\n      aye, it must be so. I&rsquo;ve oversailed him. How, got the start? Aye, he&rsquo;s\\r\\n      chasing <i>me</i> now; not I, <i>him</i>&mdash;that&rsquo;s bad; I might have known it, too.\\r\\n      Fool! the lines&mdash;the harpoons he&rsquo;s towing. Aye, aye, I have run him\\r\\n      by last night. About! about! Come down, all of ye, but the regular look\\r\\n      outs! Man the braces!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod&rsquo;s\\r\\n      quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced\\r\\n      ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own\\r\\n      white wake.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw,&rdquo; murmured Starbuck to\\r\\n      himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail. &ldquo;God keep\\r\\n      us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside wet my\\r\\n      flesh. I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Stand by to sway me up!&rdquo; cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket. &ldquo;We\\r\\n      should meet him soon.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rdquo; and straightway Starbuck did Ahab&rsquo;s bidding, and once\\r\\n      more Ahab swung on high.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held\\r\\n      long breaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three points off the\\r\\n      weather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly from the three\\r\\n      mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck\\r\\n      there!&mdash;brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind&rsquo;s eye. He&rsquo;s too far\\r\\n      off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that helmsman\\r\\n      with a top-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But let me have\\r\\n      one more good round look aloft here at the sea; there&rsquo;s time for that. An\\r\\n      old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and not changed a wink\\r\\n      since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of Nantucket! The same!&mdash;the\\r\\n      same!&mdash;the same to Noah as to me. There&rsquo;s a soft shower to leeward.\\r\\n      Such lovely leewardings! They must lead somewhere&mdash;to something else\\r\\n      than common land, more palmy than the palms. Leeward! the white whale goes\\r\\n      that way; look to windward, then; the better if the bitterer quarter. But\\r\\n      good bye, good bye, old mast-head! What&rsquo;s this?&mdash;green? aye, tiny\\r\\n      mosses in these warped cracks. No such green weather stains on Ahab&rsquo;s\\r\\n      head! There&rsquo;s the difference now between man&rsquo;s old age and matter&rsquo;s. But\\r\\n      aye, old mast, we both grow old together; sound in our hulls, though, are\\r\\n      we not, my ship? Aye, minus a leg, that&rsquo;s all. By heaven this dead wood\\r\\n      has the better of my live flesh every way. I can&rsquo;t compare with it; and\\r\\n      I&rsquo;ve known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of\\r\\n      the most vital stuff of vital fathers. What&rsquo;s that he said? he should\\r\\n      still go before me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I\\r\\n      have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless\\r\\n      stairs? and all night I&rsquo;ve been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to.\\r\\n      Aye, aye, like many more thou told&rsquo;st direful truth as touching thyself, O\\r\\n      Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good-bye, mast-head&mdash;keep\\r\\n      a good eye upon the whale, the while I&rsquo;m gone. We&rsquo;ll talk to-morrow, nay,\\r\\n      to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and tail.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered through\\r\\n      the cloven blue air to the deck.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop&rsquo;s\\r\\n      stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the\\r\\n      mate,&mdash;who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck&mdash;and bade him\\r\\n      pause.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Starbuck!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;For the third time my soul&rsquo;s ship starts upon this voyage, Starbuck.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,\\r\\n      Starbuck!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Truth, sir: saddest truth.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the\\r\\n      flood;&mdash;and I feel now like a billow that&rsquo;s all one crested comb,\\r\\n      Starbuck. I am old;&mdash;shake hands with me, man.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck&rsquo;s tears the glue.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oh, my captain, my captain!&mdash;noble heart&mdash;go not&mdash;go not!&mdash;see,\\r\\n      it&rsquo;s a brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Lower away!&rdquo;&mdash;cried Ahab, tossing the mate&rsquo;s arm from him. &ldquo;Stand by\\r\\n      the crew!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The sharks! the sharks!&rdquo; cried a voice from the low cabin-window there;\\r\\n      &ldquo;O master, my master, come back!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the\\r\\n      boat leaped on.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when\\r\\n      numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the\\r\\n      hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time they\\r\\n      dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the boat with their\\r\\n      bites. It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats in those\\r\\n      swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them in the same\\r\\n      prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments\\r\\n      in the east. But these were the first sharks that had been observed by the\\r\\n      Pequod since the White Whale had been first descried; and whether it was\\r\\n      that Ahab&rsquo;s crew were all such tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore\\r\\n      their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks&mdash;a matter\\r\\n      sometimes well known to affect them,&mdash;however it was, they seemed to\\r\\n      follow that one boat without molesting the others.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Heart of wrought steel!&rdquo; murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and\\r\\n      following with his eyes the receding boat&mdash;&ldquo;canst thou yet ring\\r\\n      boldly to that sight?&mdash;lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and\\r\\n      followed by them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third\\r\\n      day?&mdash;For when three days flow together in one continuous intense\\r\\n      pursuit; be sure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the\\r\\n      third the evening and the end of that thing&mdash;be that end what it may.\\r\\n      Oh! my God! what is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so deadly\\r\\n      calm, yet expectant,&mdash;fixed at the top of a shudder! Future things\\r\\n      swim before me, as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is\\r\\n      somehow grown dim. Mary, girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy!\\r\\n      I seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life\\r\\n      seem clearing; but clouds sweep between&mdash;Is my journey&rsquo;s end coming?\\r\\n      My legs feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,&mdash;beats\\r\\n      it yet? Stir thyself, Starbuck!&mdash;stave it off&mdash;move, move! speak\\r\\n      aloud!&mdash;Mast-head there! See ye my boy&rsquo;s hand on the hill?&mdash;Crazed;&mdash;aloft\\r\\n      there!&mdash;keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:&mdash;mark well the\\r\\n      whale!&mdash;Ho! again!&mdash;drive off that hawk! see! he pecks&mdash;he tears\\r\\n      the vane&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to the red flag flying at the\\r\\n      main-truck&mdash;&ldquo;Ha! he soars away with it!&mdash;Where&rsquo;s the old man\\r\\n      now? see&rsquo;st thou that sight, oh Ahab!&mdash;shudder, shudder!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads&mdash;a\\r\\n      downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded; but intending\\r\\n      to be near him at the next rising, he held on his way a little sideways\\r\\n      from the vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence,\\r\\n      as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads drive\\r\\n      them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and no hearse\\r\\n      can be mine:&mdash;and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then\\r\\n      quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice,\\r\\n      swiftly rising to the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a\\r\\n      subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with\\r\\n      trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise, but\\r\\n      obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it\\r\\n      hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping back\\r\\n      into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for an\\r\\n      instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes,\\r\\n      leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk\\r\\n      of the whale.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Give way!&rdquo; cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to the\\r\\n      attack; but maddened by yesterday&rsquo;s fresh irons that corroded in him, Moby\\r\\n      Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven.\\r\\n      The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead,\\r\\n      beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together; as head on, he came\\r\\n      churning his tail among the boats; and once more flailed them apart;\\r\\n      spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates&rsquo; boats, and dashing\\r\\n      in one side of the upper part of their bows, but leaving Ahab&rsquo;s almost\\r\\n      without a scar.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the\\r\\n      whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he\\r\\n      shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round and\\r\\n      round to the fish&rsquo;s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which,\\r\\n      during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines\\r\\n      around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his sable raiment\\r\\n      frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The harpoon dropped from his hand.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Befooled, befooled!&rdquo;&mdash;drawing in a long lean breath&mdash;&ldquo;Aye,\\r\\n      Parsee! I see thee again.&mdash;Aye, and thou goest before; and this, <i>this</i>\\r\\n      then is the hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last\\r\\n      letter of thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship!\\r\\n      those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to\\r\\n      me; if not, Ahab is enough to die&mdash;Down, men! the first thing that\\r\\n      but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are\\r\\n      not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.&mdash;Where&rsquo;s the\\r\\n      whale? gone down again?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the\\r\\n      corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter had\\r\\n      been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again steadily\\r\\n      swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,&mdash;which thus far had\\r\\n      been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the present her\\r\\n      headway had been stopped. He seemed swimming with his utmost velocity, and\\r\\n      now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oh! Ahab,&rdquo; cried Starbuck, &ldquo;not too late is it, even now, the third day,\\r\\n      to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that madly\\r\\n      seekest him!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to\\r\\n      leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding by the\\r\\n      vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck&rsquo;s face as he leaned\\r\\n      over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and follow him, not\\r\\n      too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards, he saw Tashtego,\\r\\n      Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three mast-heads; while the\\r\\n      oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been\\r\\n      hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in repairing them. One after\\r\\n      the other, through the port-holes, as he sped, he also caught flying\\r\\n      glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying themselves on deck among bundles of\\r\\n      new irons and lances. As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in the\\r\\n      broken boats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart. But\\r\\n      he rallied. And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the\\r\\n      main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that perch, to\\r\\n      descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to\\r\\n      the mast.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Whether fagged by the three days&rsquo; running chase, and the resistance to his\\r\\n      swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some latent\\r\\n      deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White Whale&rsquo;s way\\r\\n      now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly nearing him\\r\\n      once more; though indeed the whale&rsquo;s last start had not been so long a one\\r\\n      as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks\\r\\n      accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat; and so\\r\\n      continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades became jagged and\\r\\n      crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at almost every dip.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. Pull on!\\r\\n      &rsquo;tis the better rest, the shark&rsquo;s jaw than the yielding water.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;They will last long enough! pull on!&mdash;But who can tell&rdquo;&mdash;he\\r\\n      muttered&mdash;&ldquo;whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on\\r\\n      Ahab?&mdash;But pull on! Aye, all alive, now&mdash;we near him. The helm!\\r\\n      take the helm! let me pass,&rdquo;&mdash;and so saying two of the oarsmen helped\\r\\n      him forward to the bows of the still flying boat.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with\\r\\n      the White Whale&rsquo;s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its advance&mdash;as\\r\\n      the whale sometimes will&mdash;and Ahab was fairly within the smoky\\r\\n      mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale&rsquo;s spout, curled round his\\r\\n      great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when, with body\\r\\n      arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the poise, he darted\\r\\n      his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale. As both\\r\\n      steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked into a morass, Moby Dick\\r\\n      sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow,\\r\\n      and, without staving a hole in it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that\\r\\n      had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then\\r\\n      clung, Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea. As it was,\\r\\n      three of the oarsmen&mdash;who foreknew not the precise instant of the\\r\\n      dart, and were therefore unprepared for its effects&mdash;these were flung\\r\\n      out; but so fell, that, in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale\\r\\n      again, and rising to its level on a combing wave, hurled themselves bodily\\r\\n      inboard again; the third man helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat\\r\\n      and swimming.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,\\r\\n      instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering sea.\\r\\n      But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line,\\r\\n      and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats, and\\r\\n      tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line felt that\\r\\n      double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;What breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!&mdash;&rsquo;tis whole again; oars! oars!\\r\\n      Burst in upon him!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled\\r\\n      round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution,\\r\\n      catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing in\\r\\n      it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking it&mdash;it may be&mdash;a\\r\\n      larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing prow,\\r\\n      smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. &ldquo;I grow blind; hands! stretch\\r\\n      out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is&rsquo;t night?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The whale! The ship!&rdquo; cried the cringing oarsmen.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Oars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for ever\\r\\n      too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I see: the\\r\\n      ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the\\r\\n      sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks\\r\\n      burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat lay\\r\\n      nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew, trying hard\\r\\n      to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego&rsquo;s mast-head hammer\\r\\n      remained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as\\r\\n      with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own\\r\\n      forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the\\r\\n      bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon as\\r\\n      he.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of air,\\r\\n      now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a woman&rsquo;s\\r\\n      fainting fit. Up helm, I say&mdash;ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is this the\\r\\n      end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities? Oh, Ahab,\\r\\n      Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up helm again! He\\r\\n      turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on towards one, whose\\r\\n      duty tells him he cannot depart. My God, stand by me now!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now help\\r\\n      Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning whale!\\r\\n      Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubb&rsquo;s own unwinking eye?\\r\\n      And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft; would\\r\\n      it were stuffed with brushwood! I grin at thee, thou grinning whale! Look\\r\\n      ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever\\r\\n      spouted up his ghost. For all that, I would yet ring glasses with ye,\\r\\n      would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh! oh, oh! thou grinning whale, but\\r\\n      there&rsquo;ll be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye not, O Ahab! For me, off\\r\\n      shoes and jacket to it; let Stubb die in his drawers! A most mouldy and\\r\\n      over salted death, though;&mdash;cherries! cherries! cherries! Oh, Flask,\\r\\n      for one red cherry ere we die!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;Cherries? I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh, Stubb, I hope my\\r\\n      poor mother&rsquo;s drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers will now\\r\\n      come to her, for the voyage is up.&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      From the ship&rsquo;s bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive; hammers,\\r\\n      bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their hands,\\r\\n      just as they had darted from their various employments; all their\\r\\n      enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to side strangely\\r\\n      vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band of overspreading\\r\\n      semicircular foam before him as he rushed. Retribution, swift vengeance,\\r\\n      eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal man\\r\\n      could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship&rsquo;s\\r\\n      starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell flat upon their\\r\\n      faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on\\r\\n      their bull-like necks. Through the breach, they heard the waters pour, as\\r\\n      mountain torrents down a flume.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;The ship! The hearse!&mdash;the second hearse!&rdquo; cried Ahab from the boat;\\r\\n      &ldquo;its wood could only be American!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its keel;\\r\\n      but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far off the\\r\\n      other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab&rsquo;s boat, where, for a time, he\\r\\n      lay quiescent.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      &ldquo;I turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy hammer.\\r\\n      Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel; and only\\r\\n      god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm, and Pole-pointed prow,&mdash;death-glorious\\r\\n      ship! must ye then perish, and without me? Am I cut off from the last fond\\r\\n      pride of meanest shipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life!\\r\\n      Oh, now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from\\r\\n      all your furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole\\r\\n      foregone life, and top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee I\\r\\n      roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple\\r\\n      with thee; from hell&rsquo;s heart I stab at thee; for hate&rsquo;s sake I spit my\\r\\n      last breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool!\\r\\n      and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still\\r\\n      chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! <i>Thus</i>, I give up the\\r\\n      spear!&rdquo;\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting\\r\\n      velocity the line ran through the grooves;&mdash;ran foul. Ahab stooped to\\r\\n      clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the neck,\\r\\n      and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was shot out\\r\\n      of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone. Next instant, the heavy\\r\\n      eye-splice in the rope&rsquo;s final end flew out of the stark-empty tub,\\r\\n      knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its depths.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      For an instant, the tranced boat&rsquo;s crew stood still; then turned. &ldquo;The\\r\\n      ship? Great God, where is the ship?&rdquo; Soon they through dim, bewildering\\r\\n      mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous Fata Morgana;\\r\\n      only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by infatuation, or\\r\\n      fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the pagan harpooneers\\r\\n      still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea. And now, concentric\\r\\n      circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating\\r\\n      oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all round\\r\\n      and round in one vortex, carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of\\r\\n      sight.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken\\r\\n      head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the erect spar\\r\\n      yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag, which calmly\\r\\n      undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying billows they\\r\\n      almost touched;&mdash;at that instant, a red arm and a hammer hovered\\r\\n      backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing the flag faster\\r\\n      and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk that tauntingly had\\r\\n      followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home among the stars,\\r\\n      pecking at the flag, and incommoding Tashtego there; this bird now chanced\\r\\n      to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood;\\r\\n      and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill, the submerged savage\\r\\n      beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen there; and so the bird\\r\\n      of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards,\\r\\n      and his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with his\\r\\n      ship, which, like Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a\\r\\n      living part of heaven along with her, and helmeted herself with it.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen white\\r\\n      surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the great\\r\\n      shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      <a name=\"link2H_EPIL\" id=\"link2H_EPIL\">\\r\\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\\r\\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <h2>\\r\\n      Epilogue\\r\\n    </h2>\\r\\n    <h3>\\r\\n      &ldquo;AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE&rdquo; Job.\\r\\n    </h3>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      The drama&rsquo;s done. Why then here does any one step forth?&mdash;Because one\\r\\n      did survive the wreck.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      It so chanced, that after the Parsee&rsquo;s disappearance, I was he whom the\\r\\n      Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab&rsquo;s bowsman, when that bowsman\\r\\n      assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three men\\r\\n      were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So, floating\\r\\n      on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the\\r\\n      halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but slowly,\\r\\n      drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had subsided to a\\r\\n      creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting towards the\\r\\n      button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like\\r\\n      another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that vital centre, the black\\r\\n      bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by reason of its cunning spring,\\r\\n      and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great force, the coffin\\r\\n      life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my side.\\r\\n      Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated on\\r\\n      a soft and dirgelike main. The unharming sharks, they glided by as if with\\r\\n      padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks.\\r\\n      On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. It\\r\\n      was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her\\r\\n      missing children, only found another orphan.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\\'display:block;margin-top:4em\\'>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MOBY-DICK; OR THE WHALE ***</div>\\r\\n<div style=\\'display:block;margin:1em 0;\\'>This file should be named 2701-h.htm or 2701-h.zip</div>\\r\\n<div style=\\'display:block;margin:1em 0;\\'>This and all associated files of various formats will be found in https://www.gutenberg.org/2/7/0/2701/</div>\\r\\n<div style=\\'display:block; margin:1em 0\\'>\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one&#8212;the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\\'display:block; margin:1em 0\\'>\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\r\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.
